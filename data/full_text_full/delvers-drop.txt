LIVESTREAM TONIGHT Join us as we celebrate the last few hours of our Kickstarter! 8pm-Midnight CST (GMT-6): <url>— no separate purchases! (Except for the final goal's console port, which is TBD). All additional funds will be used to improve the game and further involve you in the world of Delver’s Drop. We will keep this updated as frequently as we can — please don't worry if we're a little behind the current campaign dollar amount, we'll update it soon! When indefinitely imprisoned high atop a towering castle complex, escape is the only option for survival and redemption. But few scoundrels will survive the Drop and live to tell the tale. The dungeons are rife with traps, monsters, and sinister secrets, awaiting the next unlucky Delver. “The HD art and visuals were looking fantastic, with the dungeon's unique and atmospheric lighting design really clicking with me.” — Heidi Keimps via Joystiq Delver's Drop is a 2D Action RPG with fluid physics-based movement, snappy combat, shifting dungeons, and a rogue's gallery of individually leveled character classes. With an emphasis on mystery and dynamic gameplay experiences, the game features randomization for infinite replay, enigmatic puzzle permutations to unravel, multiple narrative paths, customizable character growth, and layers of secrets to unearth. Our game is built on inspirations from the 8 & 16-bit eras, but acknowledges contemporary progress in game design and fully utilizes current technology. The gameplay is familiar yet distinct with stunning HD visuals and snappy, fluid 360-degree control. It is accessible yet deep and tactical, and is incredibly replayable. “The game’s art style is bursting with a vibrant and colorful palette that looks to compliment its fast paced gameplay.” — Christopher McDonald via Indie Game Magazine Delver’s Drop is currently in development for Windows PC, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, & OUYA. Show me the details, the features, the hammers and tongs! Upon first glance, most players will draw comparisons between Delver’s Drop and 2D action adventure/RPG games like A Link to the Past and Secret of Mana. While the NES and Super Nintendo era action-adventure games and RPGs are obviously a huge inspiration for us, we want to satisfy fans of these games while also introducing contemporary development and design concepts, high definition visuals, and inspiration from other action and RPG sub-genres to create a unique and original experience. Delver’s Drop has a cast of playable characters that create variety and open up different gameplay styles and tactics. Movement and combat are both fast and responsive, a blend of intense arcade action with thoughtful planning and strategy. Dungeon and items are randomized to create scenarios similar to a Roguelike. The game also features a form of permadeath, but players are able to recover some progress and items, and retain abilities and experience points. Features Immense & Unpredictable Dungeon Dive — 8 [NOW 9! via stretch goals] zones of castle dungeons with 4 sub-levels to explore. Levels will be combined from masterfully designed hand-crafted rooms and components, with randomized content and floor layouts. Physics-based Hack & Slash Combat — Since all characters and enemies move and collide on a physics-based system, any interplay of attacks, traps, and magic resolve based on responsive, snazzy, and sometimes chaotic physics effects. Multiple Characters & Play Styles — Play the game with one or all of the 5 [NOW 6! via stretch goals] character classes (some to be decided by backers!). Classes have unique speed and movement properties, weapon, special ability, and perk tree, giving each a different play style. Character Growth & Customization — Gain experience as you play each class, and keep this progress through the class’s perk tree even if your current character dies. Level up if you want more flexibility, but Delver’s Drop is totally grind-free. Weapons & Sub-Items — The player can find and purchase interesting and upgraded weapons for each class, as well as a large suite of expendable sub-items that are randomly spawn during each session. But items slots are limited, requiring intelligent use! Puzzles & Secrets — Like many action adventure games, Delver’s Drop will feature interesting puzzles, requiring clever manipulation of dungeon elements, using physics to advantage, and resourceful usage of secondary items. Game Mechanics Read more about our features in the updates below! Characters & Classes (Part 1 of 3) Items & Dungeons (Part 2 of 3) Extended Play (Part 3 of 3) The story for those who like narrative, lore, and invented worlds! You play as several adventuring miscreants imprisoned for unknown reasons in a dungeon atop a mountain, in an ever-changing castle complex. Built up over countless years of construction, this labyrinth-like structure forms a maze of interlocking rooms that mysteriously shift in a constantly changing layout. The prisoners are released one by one into these depths, and challenged to find their way to freedom. But to do so they must brave the Drop: a pit that tunnels deep into the mountain’s core and connects the castle’s deteriorating layers, each of which contains puzzles that must be solved in order to open the Drop to the descending levels. As they explore deeper, the adventurers begin to unravel the true reasons for their imprisonment, while discovering that other, darker secrets lie in the castle’s deeper vaults. When one prisoner fails, another is cast down into the Drop, taking advantage of their predecessors’ progress. But for every dubious hero that you fail to keep alive, a darker threat will await the next unlucky delver... Read the full story in this update! Find out how you'll get the game, where you'll play it, and when! Release Dates: The game will release on PC / Mac / Linux in October 2013. Pricing is set at $15. It will later release for iOS / Android / OUYA around February 2014. Pricing is undetermined. LINUX DAY-ONE SUPPORT HAS BEEN ADDED VIA THE STRETCH GOALS! It will be available on release with other desktop versions. $15 TIER: Pre-Order the PC / Mac / Linux / iOS / Android / OUYA Game: Pledging at any tier of $15 or higher will offer access to a digital desktop copy of the game (DRM-free), plus lots of digital bonuses, including the soundtrack and open beta access. It's a great value only available on Kickstarter. We will never offer a better pre-order deal, so please pre-order here! You will receive builds for PC, Mac, and Linux when they become available. The exact method of distribution for these builds is still being determined (email, direct download link, etc). You will also receive Open Beta access in September — you'll get to play the game a month early! The game will be almost complete, so you will be able to participate in giving us feedback to fix any remaining bugs (and possibly some final polish). Note that Open Beta may not be exclusive to Kickstarter. You will also receive builds for iOS, Android, and OUYA when they release in February, 2014. These do not have any Beta access. $25 TIER: Early Alpha / Closed Beta Access: Backers at tiers of $25 and above will also be given access to our Early Alpha and Closed Beta. This means you get to play early versions of the game almost 4 months before its official release! Note that iOS/Android/OUYA are not included in the Alpha or Beta. Alpha is targeted for late June, and means that the game will be feature complete, but some aspects may still be undergoing revision, and not all content (levels, characters, enemies) will be finished. This is an exciting time, because backers at this level can give feedback to influence some features! However, you may have to expect the game will be rough around the edges :) Our forums may or may not be operational by Alpha. Alpha may not include Linux versions, or they may come later. Closed Beta will occur in August, and means that all features and content are present but may not be complete or polished. We invite you to participate in the Closed Beta so that you can give us feedback to help us improve and tweak all features to perfection, as well as report any issues (bugs) you encounter. Linux versions may come later, but we will try to release them simultaneously. Closed Beta is different from Open Beta in that: 1) it begins a month earlier (August instead of September), 2) Closed Beta contributors will have more influence on improving the game and tuning features, while Open Beta will consist mainly of bug fixes. Playing the Game — System Specs: If you have a PC / Mac / Linux desktop computer that was manufactured within the last 5 years, chances are you can run our game. For iOS and Android, we will support most recently released models (from the last 2-3 years if not older). Check out our second update for more specific compatibility information! We know you want your rewards after Delving this far! Below you will see all of the rewards listed to the right, but in even more detail. IMPORTANT! We have added many more rewards as the campaign has progressed, and these are NOT updated in the sidebar to the right! See the chart and reward icons below for the 100% accurate breakdown of what you're getting. Also see our FINAL REWARDS UPDATE (Mar. 8, 2013) for more info if you are new! CHECK OUT THE CHART BELOW FOR A BETTER IDEA OF WHICH REWARDS YOU'RE GETTING! Click to view the zoomed in version. Rewards List: All designs are to be determined - the icons are merely to give you a general idea of what you'll receive. If you have questions about a reward, just ask! As of February 2013 the game is in a pre-alpha state. While the aspects present in the videos may seem polished, there are still many features to complete, and many more environments, enemies, and items for which we need to produce art and sound. With your support we will be able to much more efficiently complete the game to the full extent of our vision. June 2013 — Alpha: The game will be highly playable, with most features and at least 50% of the content complete. Large amounts of videos, screenshots, and other content will be available to backers here and at <url>— Closed Beta: The game will be nearly complete, with all features final but requiring some polish and bug-fixes. At least 75% of the content will be complete, with all remaining content present but in placeholder form. September 2013 – Open Beta: Backers $15 and up can get the game a month early! The game will be 99% complete, but may still have a few bugs, so you can give us feedback on our forums to make final tweaks before the official release. October 2013 — RELEASE! for PC, Mac, Linux: The game is 100% complete and (as reasonably as possible) bug free. Digital copies will be distributed, and shortly thereafter, physical copies to backers at tiers with this reward (and any remaining rewards). LINUX HAS BEEN ADDED VIA THE STRETCH GOALS! February 2014 — iOS / Android / OUYA Release: The iOS, Android, and OUYA versions will be completed and released. So far we've been funding Delver’s Drop through contract work as well as personal and external investments. Kickstarter offers us the best chance to secure the remaining funding we need to complete the game, and will provide us the opportunity to build a community around the game’s development. We’ll be using the funds to meet the following goals: First and foremost, to finish the development of the game, with a high degree of quality and within our designated release time frame. This would not be possible without Kickstarter. Additional programming support for more features and more extensive polish. Even more content, art, and elaborate animations and effects. We want to include even more characters, enemies, environments, weapons, and magic. Additional sound and music, possibly to include voice overs. Localization into French, Italian, German, Spanish, and Portuguese. Additional quality assurance and testing. Building a community around the game and universe through forums and communication with our supporters through this Kickstarter campaign. Documentation and more refined tools for fan mods.

Greetings, Delvers! Winter is at hand (at least in the northern hemisphere), and hopefully the season is treating all of you well as the holidays get into full swing. For those in the US, we hope you had a happy Thanksgiving and were able to enjoy family, friends, and a good game or two. We do have some excellent news that we’ve been excitedly waiting to share! But first, we want to apologize for the long delay prior to this update. We’ve continued to make steady progress, but as usual, there is a lot of “under the hood” system work. We were also waiting until everything was fully in place to make the following announcement: Additions To The Team Our team has always been very small, and development speeds have been effectively capped at the output of our single developer. In an effort to formulate a more clear and efficient path forward, we have been hoping to bring on additional programming help for some time. Over recent months, we also finally reached a point in development where we could easily introduce new team members to the codebase, and get them prepared to make contributions to the game. So we have now added two new part-time programmers to our team: Brandon and James. Both of them are very excited to help with the game, and were actually following it for some time before they started working with us. It was a really great moment for our team when we began to introduce them to the code, and we're looking forward to what we can accomplish together. We also have high hopes that the extra bandwidth with continue to smooth out and speed up the development process. Both Brandon and James began working with us several months ago, mainly learning the game’s design &amp; systems, and becoming familiar with the code. Now that they are about to begin making significant contributions to the game, we are pleased to introduce them to you! Brandon has experience working on several smaller games (some personally and some professionally), mostly in Unity, as well as expertise in app and web development. He is also a Mac and Linux aficionado, adding further knowledge and passion to our interest in platform diversity. In fact, he originally sent in his application specifically due to his interest in our future Linux port. He is especially intrigued by the complex room and puzzle generation aspects of Delvers, and is excited to assist in that area. And as a person with red-green colorblindness, Brandon is very interested in helping to ensure that the UI is color-blindness-aware. This will help keep game and its systems highly accessible for all. James has a similar skillset to Brandon, though he remains a PC loyalist. He had experience working in Unity and tablet game development, in addition to web dev. After he applied to work with us, we discover that he conveniently lives less than a block from our office — so he now holds the record for shortest commute. With his interest in fighting games, he is most looking forward to working on Delver’s Drop’s combat system. We have been wanting to add greater depth, and James’ knowledge of fighting mechanics will be a great asset. He is very interested in continuing to refine the poise-like stun mechanics we’ve developed, based on his love of poise in Dark Souls. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Art Updates Since the last update, we’ve continued to focus our efforts on enemy artwork. We've been working to refine which enemies appear together, as well as concepting additional abilities for them, in order to create more challenging tactical situations through their behaviors. We’ve also continued to keep world-building in mind by creating further cohesion between the zones, the elemental forces in the game’s lore, and the enemy “species” that are tied to each. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Development Updates While the new programmers have been learning the code base and understanding the design direction of the game, we’ve worked on improvements to lighting, ambient darkness, the texture system, and other aspects. Previously the ambient darkness (the dark-tinting “shadowed” effect in rooms) tended to make them either too hard to see or washed out. This turned much of our colorful artwork into blander grayed tints, or caused enemies to blend into the background. Our goal was to create a sense of mystery and dread through the darkening effects, but often times it simply made the game hard to play... and not in a way that we considered to be "challenging yet fun." Our improvements should help the rooms to appear more vibrant where lit, but also more convincingly dark and moody elsewhere. We’ve also updated animation support for the latest Spine runtime and features. This is actually a crucially important step as our animation pipeline was previously incredibly complex and unwieldy (as mentioned in previous updates). But by using some of Spine’s newest features, we are able to drastically simplify some things, decreasing the time necessary for animating and also increasing maintainability. So what the artists had been doing in Spine needed to become fully supported in code, and now that integration is complete. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ What’s Next Gameplay systems are moving back to the development forefront, and we will be doing another integration pass on the random generation, with a goal of more interesting and tightly-designed levels. We will also continue with numerous new enemies, traps, interactives, items, and art updates in general. We will be working on putting together another update soon with further details. It has also been brought to our attention that there are several issues with the forum and our websites. We hope that you all understand we are attempting to give all of the time we possibly can to the game, and so additional aspects of our marketing are very low priority at the moment. However, fixing these aspects of our web presence is on the to-do list — we just do not have a specific ETA for these updates. Thank you all very much for your continued support! We appreciate it immensely. Email: <email> Salutations, Delvers, and welcome to the newest update! Thank you all again for your support, encouragement, and patience as we continue to make progress on the game. It is a huge morale boost to us when we hear from each of you, and we really enjoy discussing the game’s mechanics and hearing your thoughts. We appreciate each and every virtual high-five, and continue to look forward to your feedback. For this update, we decided to focus on enemies since they had not been featured in quite a while. Our character designer has been working to create several new designs and refining some previous artwork. And with the addition of the new universal improvements to the bipedal character skeleton, we’re excited to create a few more humanoid characters for the player to combat — especially those that wield weapons and offer a greater tactical challenge. We’ve also been refining the enemy groupings in various levels and habitats in order to provide a unique and challenging balance of tactics in each zone. Below is a selection of some of our most recent artwork. Beasts (Above) Mire Wolf and Rupture Boar In the world of the Delvers, most creatures have descended from several ancient races of celestial beasts. The family trees of the major species have intertwined over time, creating cross-breeds, and resulting in smaller and less powerful creatures — though they are still quite a threat to humans. The oldest living ancestors of the beasts are enormous, and often feature unique (and powerfully magical) characteristics. Most enemy beasts that the Delvers will encounter in the dungeons of the Drop are mixed-breed mongrels that have been affected by the Spoil Swamps. These seeping bogs alter the beasts born in or near them, causing mutations and introducing features of Murk and Spoil-born beasts into their physiology. This Spoil influence is evidenced by reptilian, amphibious, or aquatic features in otherwise mammalian or avian creatures — such as scales, fins, spines, webbed toes or wings, and poisonous blood or breath. The more chimeric the beast, the more likely its bloodline has been tainted by the influence of the Spoil. Others like the races of boars still carry some of their elemental heritage, and in the case shown above, can unleash thunderous explosive energy. Gobels (Above, top left to bottom right) Gobeling, Gobel Brute, Gobel Harrier, Spoil-Sorcerer, and Gobogre The Gobels represent one of the greatest threats to the world of the Drop, and to the player. They are not exactly intelligent or cunning, but they have an unnerving determination that results from an inability to experience pain or fear. These creatures grow from the remains of humanoid lifeforms in the spoil, multiply incessantly as they are spawned from the bogs, and then grow unchecked as they continue to eat. They have no survival instinct, and when threatened or opposed (or when they are simply hungry), they will attack the unwary in swarms of hodgepodge bodies. They tend to begin life as small round blobs with only eyes and a mouth, and then grow legs, a sensory protrusion that looks like a nose, and other appendages from there. The larger they grow and the more human or animal flesh they consume, the more they begin to assimilate the properties of other beasts. They do not gain the ability to deduct or learn, but they may begin to exhibit traits through absorbed instinct. Smaller Gobels with arms will begin to use shields, and larger gobels will don armor and wield weapons. Their use of these implements is clumsy, and they will never duel the player like another human, but these traits are unsettling at best, and cause the Gobels to represent an even greater threat. Their connection to the Spoil also allows them to tap into its elemental magic naturally, so a Spoil-Sorcerer Gobel can be quite a threat. More Coming Soon (Enemies above are not final, and may be changed) We’re planning to work on even more enemies this month, so we’ll be in touch again soon with even more images! Development Progress On the technical side of our art efforts, we are attempting to finalize the updates to the characters’ animation skeleton using our animation software, Spine by Esoteric ( esotericsoftware.com ). This will not only help us to continue animating the remaining characters efficiently, but will also allow us to add further animations to all characters simultaneously. As mentioned above, we also look forward to using a (slightly modified) version of this improved skeleton rig to animate humanoid and bipedal enemies, such as all of the Gobels above. Only the smallest Gobel uses his own simpler, unique skeleton; the rest will be driven by the same framework that will animate the player characters, but with more interesting animations to give them a different posture and style of movement. On the programming front, our main efforts are still centered around dashing, and differentiating quick evasive dashes from sustained, straight running charges. We’re continuing to work on functions relating to combat, and have been cleaning out some older aspects of the codebase in order to continue implementing new features efficiently. We are also working on an updated (and unified) state list for the player and enemies, which will allow for more unique states when one receives damage. Previously, any amount of damage was likely to result in knocking the character back and causing them to remain stunned for short period, which was always a fixed amount of time. This led to some frustration during gameplay, since it made the game feel more “old-school,” like the knockback in NES games like Castlevania. Due to our physics system, this knockback still felt somewhat natural, but it could be frustrating when a very small amount of damage resulted in a significant amount of “input loss” and interrupted play just as much as a heavier hit. Therefore we’ve been working toward having more gradations between fully stunned / knocked down and simply clipped by minor damage. We’re taking a page or two from games that handle it well, such as various fighting games and the Dark Souls series. If you have thoughts about our previous implementation in the demo on Humble, please let us know! (Or if you haven’t played the demo, send us an email at <email> and we’ll get your key to you!) As always, we look forward to your feedback on the art, game design, play, and story. Please keep in touch and drop some thoughts in the comments! Thank you for reading! Web: <url>"charge up" this dash move, but after a moment the character will start running in the current facing direction — basically like old-school Zelda Pegasus Boots. The mechanic is based on the offensive capabilities of the current dash, but lasts much longer, and the player can control how far they dash by simply holding down the button until they want to stop. This move will also allow the player to traverse long distances even quicker, without the start and stop of the previous dash. But obviously this will come at an expense to your energy meter, so you can't dash (or dodge) forever. We're very excited about the improvements the new dash(es) will make by expanding combat variety and providing more options for dungeon traversal. We have a few more interesting ideas about what specific classes or equipment may do to enhance the dodge and dash, but we'll show you our prototype of the mechanic first and see what you think! Art Update: Characters &amp; Animation On the creative side, we've been working on the artwork for the remaining characters, including the Elementalist and the Musketeer. Their designs were created a while ago, but we've been working on splitting up their composite parts for animation, and beginning the process of designing their additional angles of rotation (since characters can face up, down, left, right, and diagonals). Since we are a top-down 2D game, we have to paint each direction (or at least the ones that can't be mirrored), and make sure that they appear to "rotate" correctly when the character changes direction, without any strange pops, jitters, or inadvertant changes in proportion. In the process of setting these up for animation, we've also been making several improvements to the characters' animation skeleton. This will result in some animation improvements not only for the new characters, but for the previously available characters as well. Since the animation software we use (Spine by Esoteric Software: <url>"rotation" directions without having to make completely unique animations for each angle. This is a huge improvement over our previous process, where we had to animate each direction by hand, and then often had to manually copy-paste each characters' animations to the next character skeleton! We're very grateful that Esoteric has been making so many improvements to their animation software, because it's helping us to save a ton of time (and maintain a lot more sanity). It's a bit of tough work for right now, but it will pay off exponentially in time-savings to complete the game's animation work. Closing Scribbles: Thank you for reading! As always, if you have any questions you can email us at <email>. Web: <url>’ve been hard at work ensuring that the possible physics interactions within that system are implemented appropriately. In our last update, we touched on our efforts to polish character movement properties — these include acceleration, traction, stopping friction, and sliding on low-friction surfaces like ice. As a part of the process, we have been working on propulsion parameters (using force to propel objects). This is the feature that allows bombs to explode and send other objects flying across the room; it also allows the Delvers to have an instantaneous dash ability. When we test mechanics like this, we often tie the mechanic in question to a hotkey, so that our developers can execute the feature at will over and over, without worrying about items or other stats. So we can currently hit a single key that creates an area of extreme force, centered on the Delver. While he was testing this, our programmer added a feature that caused the inverse — an attracting force like magnetism. In the original implementation of the physics system (before we revised it), we thought this type of attractive force was going to be time-consuming difficult to develop, given the constraints of the system. But with our revisions, this feature was very simple to add — in fact, it more or less came about as a byproduct of the testing and polish process. So instead of spending days or weeks implementing this new feature (and then spending months fixing bugs resulting from it), we now have a stable magnetism feature which was built in an afternoon! One of the other cool aspects of this feature is that expulsion and attraction can now be applied selectively - so it can affect everything at once, or only one type of entity, such as coins, items, inanimate objects, enemies, or only the player. We’re sure many of you have wondered why we were taking so long to revise the physics system, especially when it’s hard to see how important physics might be to a roguelike dungeon-crawler. We did not build physics simply as a means to natural movement or combat. The true possibilities of the new physics system lie in the creation of amazing abilities, spells, and effects that leverage the physics system and result in new gameplay possibilities. To show off this feature, we’ve included a simple video below showing our tests. Just to let you in on our thought process, here are some examples of how these features might be used. Many of these would not have been possible in the previous physics system! Constantly attract coins toward the player (but not other objects) for easy collection of loot and gold. Magical pillars in rooms (or a gravity spell) that can pull on the player and enemies when active, sucking them toward the center of their force. Magnetic pillars activated by a switch could also be used in puzzles. A wand that can be “charged” (holding down the attack button) to attract and levitate inanimate objects like crates. Then when the spell is unleashed (the button is released), these objects are sent flying across the room to crash into enemies. Please pardon the visuals! For testing purposes, we typically use rooms with a generic (flat-color) tileset, some animations are disabled, and some debug features are turned on. We also have pits, walls, and particle effects turned off! You may also notice some unintentional clipping, given the amount of force being applied — things get a little crazy! We will be fixing these issues as we continue to test these features. Last Month’s Survey Thank you to everyone who participated in our survey last month! The survey itself is now closed, but we had a great response, with even more feedback than we had expected. To those of you who may have missed it, we asked a number of questions to help us pre-balance the game, focusing on elements such as difficulty, length of play, and the balance of player skill necessary for completion. The responses were largely in agreement, and in line with our own targets and the gameplay goals set forth in the campaign — so we were happy to be reassured that we are definitely on track to meet the desires of players. We also wanted to ensure that our efforts toward the completion of the game appropriately (and proportionally) targeted the aspects of the game in which you were most interested (story, equipment, secrets, etc). These responses were also very helpful, and will continue to assist us in refining our schedule and focusing on the areas of the game that will result in the most fun, and the greatest satisfaction of you all — our backers. Thank you again! And if you missed the survey but would still like for your voice to be heard, you can always send us a private message, or email us at <email> Thank you for reading! Web: <url>— they have also allowed for much greater control over the design and feel of things like character movement. This has required some re-engineering of our property values, so data like a character’s acceleration, traction, and stopping friction are currently being revised and rebalanced. The Rogue has gotten even tighter movement control, with just a little bit of slide when stopping, while the Sorcerer remains floaty and slippery. But we are also working to improve his handling! While enhancing the control and movement capabilities, we have also been taking a hard look at our overall game design and features in order to improve our efficiency and re-focus on the most important elements of the game. Our goal is partly an effort to increase our rate of feature-completion, but we are also attempting to accelerate the areas that deserve the most attention: shoring up deficiencies and amplifying areas where the game excels. SURVEY - We want your feedback! To this end, we’ve created a short survey to gather feedback about the game’s concept, features, difficulty, and what you most want to see from Delver’s Drop! We encourage all of you to fill it out here: <url>’s purpose is to re-confirm our backers’ expectations so that we continue toward the game you are hoping Delver’s Drop will become. It may also help us to prioritize features you really want to see sooner than others. The second goal of the survey is to gain insight into which components of the game most excite each of you, so that we can focus additional attention on what you really want to see. When you backed the project, were you most excited by the Roguelike elements, Zelda inspirations, random loot, or something else in our concept? As with other Action-RPG / Roguelike-like games, there are many layered systems, and everyone prefers certain systems or types of challenge better than others. So we would like your feedback on which features you think will be the most fun, and some general feedback to better understand your gaming preferences - we want to make sure we remain aware of your interests and expectations. Ultimately, your responses will help us balance the game! So we hope all of you will give us a few minutes of your time and tell us what most excites you about Delver’s Drop, what led you to back the campaign, and what you truly want to see us accomplish! There is also some room within the survey to write additional comments if you have further thoughts. We will likely follow up with additional surveys after the next build is available, since we know that many of you will have much more specific feedback at that time! OUYA &amp; Platform Support Update Several people have asked about our promised Ouya version, and what will become of it now that the Ouya system has been discontinued. First, let’s recap what we currently plan support, and our immediate goals: We are still committed to PC/Mac/Linux for the initial release, as promised. After that, iOS will follow, and then Android support. After the Android port is complete, Ouya would have been the next port, since the Ouya is Android-based and would have been an easy conversion. While it was not initially a part of our campaign, we added Ouya support due to a flood of backer inquiries, and its growing popularity and success at the time. However, looking back, it was likely an error for us to specifically target a single device. All of the other systems/ports (PC, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android) are platforms with a specific OS — whereas Ouya is a device , though it is based on the Android platform. Devices come and go, but successful platforms tend to remain. In short, we should perhaps have mentioned the likelihood of an Ouya port along with general Android support, or as one possibility out of several potential devices. Now, since it seems that Ouya is no longer viable, we will consider other options. We will hold off on any further porting decisions until the port development process is ready to begin, so that we do not pick another platform which may be phased out, bought out, DOA, or may generally become a bad fit for our backers / fanbase / market. After we begin the port to Android, we will likely allow backers to vote on a short list of Android-based devices that are still relevant at that time — such as Amazon FireTV, NVidia Shield, or Razer Forge TV (which might be the successor to Ouya?). The good news is that Android devices are plentiful (and should continue to be for years), and we may be able to support more than one device after that initial port has been completed, depending on the success of the game. We still cannot speak to any console or handheld ports. Some have asked if we could support a console such as the Switch, Vita, 3DS, etc as a replacement for the Ouya. But unfortunately, any console port would be much more difficult and costly than a port to an Android-based device. We are not saying it will never happen, but any console port possibilities will be entirely dependent upon the financial success of the game, and the interest of our backers and fanbase after release. We hope this additional information is helpful and satisfactory to all backers! Feel free to let us know if you have any other questions or suggestions. And don’t forget to fill out the survey, which asks some questions about platform support! Closing Scribbles... As always, thank you so much for your continued patience and support! We hope you will drop your thoughts in the comments, or if you have more specific concerns and questions, please reach out through direct message, or via <email> Thank you for reading! Web: <url>’re back again for a quick monthly recap of our progress and some interesting tidbits about the world of the Delvers. Game Update We’re primarily hard at work on the full upgrade of gameplay code into uniformity with the recently completed engine changes. This involves revising many of our physics values and player stats, such as friction values, acceleration, top speed, and many of the other bits of data that determine how objects and characters move, and how the game feels. The “game feel” of Delver’s Drop is extremely important to us, and we believe that these improvements will be very well received by all concerned. We had many comments from some of you, from forum users, and convention attendees concerning the “slippery” feel of several of the characters. While the natural-feeling physics of the game is important to us, we have been working to rein in the slip-and-slide nature of character movement (and in other cases, to intentionally retain it). We are doing this while keeping the other positive elements of fluidity and the impression of what we like to call “cartoon realism,” or the internal consistency and impression of realism within our otherwise invented world. These updates are both improving the flexibility of our system (so that we can make characters feel even more unique), and improving the ability for you and the rest of our player base to mod the game. Previously many of the values were by necessity completely invented “magic numbers” with little to no real-world coherence — e.g. what does a friction setting of 5,000 mean anyway, and why does it feel so similar to 10,000 friction? These values are now much more comprehensible, both to our design team, and some day, to those of you who wish to edit our data files. And simultaneously, we are continuing to tune the feel of the game so that it controls much more responsively than before. In other news, support for Mac OSX 10.12 Sierra is complete, tested, and fully functional. In the meantime, we’ve discovered some sporadic issues with Windows 10, where the game may randomly fail to load about 10% of the time. So this is next on the list of engine versus operating system fixes. ------------------------------------------------------- Art Update We’ve also been working on some much-needed improvements (and simplifications) to the weapon system. The goal has been too make them more understandable by players, manageable by our designers, and generally making it possible for us to complete the remaining weapon art that still needs to be done. Weapons will still be randomly dropped and feature randomized stats that change their look. But we are attempting to ensure that our effort in this system has the most payoff for players, while avoiding having to paint a few extra thousand unique-looking weapons that ultimately have very similar stats. Instead, we’re focusing on unique art where there is the most exciting ramifications in terms of play, such as unique damage types or movesets for one particular weapon within a category. We’ve also been working on some improvements to the randomizable parts and graphical layers of the weapons, so that while the system is simpler, individual weapon types can actually have more unique-looking variants. In the below examples, we’re showing off some of the different layers and color tints that can be applied to weapons to make a single weapon category such as this Broadsword have a large variety of unique instances. The names of the weapons will be much more interesting once these updates are in game, and more layers may be included, such as crests and gemstones. ------------------------------------------------------- Lore Delving Have you wondered why the Delver’s faces are always in shadow? In our earliest sketches, this was partly inspired by other games (especially Final Fantasy black mages). But our primary motivation for this choice was to hide the characters’ identities so that the player could more easily imagine that these characters could be anyone — and could more easily imagine themselves in the role of that character. Ultimately, I enjoy RPGs that allow me to invest a bit of my own personality and play style into the roles of the playable characters. This often requires either a degree of player customization, or a playable character that is a bit of a blank slate or cipher designed to convey the player’s choices, or both. The goal of Delver’s Drop was to allow the player to inhabit a fairly alien fantasy world, touched a bit of zaniness, especially in the fact that our main characters are all scoundrels. To make these characters customizable ciphers, while retaining a large degree of whimsy and eccentricity in their designs, we chose to hide their faces, and leave only mysterious glowing eyes. Our hope is that you could imagine that you could be a Delver if you lived in their imagined universe, regardless of your past or your experiences. In the context of their world, the Delvers hide their faces for a few reasons. One may be obvious — since they are all criminals of one degree or another, and are persecuted (whether justly or not), they must go about in disguise. But this has a greater significance within the Guilds, the sects to which the Delvers belong. When one chooses to become a Delver, they have to leave their old life behind to varying degrees, in order to serve the cause of their Guild. The symbol they all bear to identify this choice is called the Grimcloak — a magical shadow that covers them. The Grimcloak hides their skin, and leaves only their glowing eyes and other faint features visible, as well as lending other supernatural properties. The average observer would identify an individual wearing a Grimcloak as a Delver, but through its magic the Grimcloak shifts and distorts the perceptions of the observer (like a glamour or veil, for those who read fantasy novels). In short, the observer would not be able to describe the Delver’s height, build, gender, hair color, clothing, or any other distinguishing features afterward. This makes it the perfect disguise in pursuit of the Delvers’ often less-than-upright goals. So why would the city guards not simply round up every Delver that they find, assuming that if one is guilty then they all are? Well, for one, this is no easy task — it may often be simpler and safer for the guards to turn a blind eye, unless they directly observe a crime in progress, or are looking for a dangerous fight. On the other hand, could a guard recognize the same Delver again, if they later seemed to look like any ordinary citizen? ------------------------------------------------------- Closing Scribbles... Again, thank you so much for your continued patience and support! We hope you will drop your thoughts in the comments, or if you have more specific concerns and questions, please reach out through direct message, or via email at <email> Thank you for reading! Web: <url>— but please know that we are working as hard as we possibly can, and are committed to the completion and release of Delver’s Drop. 2016 was a difficult year for several of us, personally and professionally, but we have been making improvements both in the company and in our own working habits to increase efficiency and make much better progress in 2017. Those of you who are still waiting with anticipation surely hope that Delver’s Drop will be amazing, as do we — to you, we continue to promise an excellent game, and a quality product. For those of you who want something to play as soon as possible, we have heard your requests, and are making every effort to prioritize the items needed to release a new demo. We can only ask for your patience as we work toward these new builds, and hope that you have enjoyed the past builds that have been available via Humble. If you have not played the old build(s) or have not received your key, please contact us via private message or at <email>! On Updates &amp; Communication: Our number one backer request, and the one that we have fallen short of the most frequently is regular Kickstarter updates. Our goal has always been to fill updates with progress and good news, but your comments have encouraged us to realize that even the struggles we face may be worthy of an update. We understand that to many of you, being a part of our story may be almost as important as receiving a finished product. Your generous contributions deserve a more thorough and frequent explanation of what the project's Kickstarter funding has made possible. And while we have kept to our schedule of doing regular art livestreams twice per month, we realize that many of you would prefer written updates. Consequently, we will be putting our livestreams on the backburner, and may only do one every couple of months for the purposes of a video that we link from within a Kickstarter update. The time we will save by doing fewer livestreams will be put directly into writing and publishing updates. So in the new year, we will get back on a schedule of updates at least once per month, if not more frequently. They may only be a couple of paragraphs at a time, but they will detail our progress... and our struggles. So in that spirit, on to our year-end summary: 2016 Progress Update While 2016 was filled with progress, it was a rough uphill climb through engine issues and rework — specifically improving performance while reworking the physics system (which influences everything from character movement, to pushing objects, to explosions). We know that we have mentioned this before, but our engine has been the one most painful aspect of the project, and this grueling patch of rework was holding up gameplay feature development. But finally, within the last month, we have crested the mountaintop of engine work, which is now 99% complete. The result is drastically improved performance and the elimination of large numbers of current (and future) bugs. At this point, the engine will only require an occasional minor fix to accommodate gameplay features or to ensure operating system compatibility. This comes as a huge relief to us, and hopefully to you as well. We are now working our way back into gameplay feature development, which is the most necessary element for producing new and interesting playable builds. So we’re entering the new year with much more momentum, and expect this to continue forward in the coming months. We also hope to add another part-time programmer to the team shortly! But we are also excited to tell you about the many technical improvements that this engine work has allowed. Specifically, the game will now run with double the efficiency (and more stable framerates), meaning we can have many more enemies, spells, and explosions on-screen at once. It will also be more reliable on lower-spec devices, which means that many more of you will be able to fully enjoy the game on your device of choice (hopefully without a hint slowdown). Development Progress: Updated physics system: now quad-tree-based, with discrete resolutions and many gameplay ideas integrated into the system. Instead of trying to shoehorn cool gameplay mechanics into only moderately workable physics, we know have a deeper level of integration which resolves a lot of bugs and gives us more design flexibility. These spatial partitioning changes (via quad tree) have also dramatically improved performance for us, lowering the baseline machine requirements and in general allowing us to have a lot more dynamic objects resolved. On some devices we tested, this resulted in an order of magnitude improvement in performance. Fully integrated unicode support for language localizations down the road. Improved build process (now integrated into a single process) for Windows, Mac, etc, meaning that we will be able to much more quickly and easily create builds on multiple platforms at once. Lots of specific fixes and updates for Windows 10 compatibility. Update to support OSX 10.12 Sierra - almost complete. Other updates and improvements needed for the future system ports. Content &amp; Art Progress: While we have shown off many art and design updates through our livestreams (many of which are available on our YouTube channel), we will begin showing off more of this work in Kickstarter updates, so that those who have not watched us live will still see our work on a regular basis: Additional zone tiles and object artwork, to both improve current zones and work toward completions of later levels. Weapon art &amp; designs for many more weapon categories, which were planned but not previously available - more staffs and wands, instruments, shields, etc. New enemy art for many enemies that were also planned, but had not yet been created - including additional ghosts, insects, gobels, cultists, and more. Implemented newly developed features from our animation software ( Esoteric Spine ) into our art pipeline for more fluid animations - specifically mesh and path distortion. This allows for effects like fire and lightning to be animated based on a mesh for more fluid movement, and will also allow us to more easily make animations for curving objects like whips or enemy tails. This also drastically speeds up animation, since we were previously drawing every frame of animation for some effects - which looks cool but has been very time-consuming. We will still be doing some traditional animation when the effect is warranted, but these new Spine features will reduce the workload by at least 50%. Improved character animation rig, which will allow us to more quickly finish the remaining characters and add more humanoid enemies efficiently, as well as create even more fluid animations for additional weapons and abilities. Enhancements to the story, adding more layers of world-building and character development, and deeper narrative significance to the mechanics already present within the game. Improvements in UI layout and design (waiting to be implemented). This also included some work toward improved user experience planning, and future-proofing for touch-screen-based gameplay. 2017 Roadmap Now that the new year is upon us, let’s get down to business. Immediate Development Goals: Our main objective for the new year is to release an updated Windows and Mac builds, including: All of the tech changes mentioned above, for optimized performance Integration of the not-yet-released (but complete) fully-procedural room and level generation, with infinite random various for rooms Better gameplay feel and physics interactions (pushing, bumping into objects, knocking back enemies, etc.) Updated controls with improved dodging and other mechanics Improved character art with additional animations New enemy and weapon types. Enhanced level aesthetics, with updated tile art, environments/walls, and more room objects for greater level variety. This includes such features as floating rooms surrounded by pits, (or with larger inner pits), and rooms with more doors, windows, columns, etc. Subsequent Development Goals: Endless Drop Mode updated with new room generation mechanics for greater variety. Features added to complete this as a full gameplay mode, with some simple additional mechanics such as progress tracking (rather than a basic series of endless rooms). Finish implementation of the status effects system, which has been programmed to 75% completion, but has not been fully integrated for scripting. This will allow for more power-ups, potions, buffs, and debuffs to add gameplay variety and Roguelike experiences. Improved gameplay abilities and options for greater strategy in battles, so that the game is less Gauntlet-ish hack-and-slash, and more Zelda II or Dark Souls-esque in combat. These include multi-strike “combos” (swinging weapons in different directions from one slash to another), shield deflection, more precise 360° projectile aiming, and much more. There are a number of additional items we would like to accomplish in 2017, and hopefully the above is just the tip of the iceberg. But for now, these are our most specific goals. We will keep you all more up-to-date as items are completed or refined, and as additional goals are added to the list. Kickstarter Rewards: Many have asked about the status of Kickstarter rewards. We were hoping to mail the next round of packages last year, but the biggest hold-up has been the completion of the game manual. With many of the features still in progress and undergoing revision, we did not want to release an inaccurate manual. However, since the manual is more for fun (as a keepsake) than for instructional purposes, we will be attempting to fast-track its design and production so that we can complete your packages and mail them. We will likely send out a new survey to make sure that we have up-to-date addresses for everyone. This will be announced in a future Kickstarter update. We will also keep you updated on the manual design, and once it is printed, we will send packages containing the following items (below). Note that the contents of your package depend upon the level of your pledge, but if you are due any or all of following items, they will be arriving together! $60+ backers will receive (in reward shipment #1): Set of 4 pins (1” button size) Small Art Print (11 x 8.5” horizontal) Black &amp; White Game Manual $80 and up backers will also receive (in the same package): T-Shirt with Delver’s Drop logo Sticker sheet (with 6 character face stickers) All other rewards will be delivered in one or more rounds of packages at a later time. Additional posters and art prints (not listed above) will be shipped closer to the completion of the game, in poster-tubes. All physical copies of the game, Rogue figurines, and art books will be delivered after the game has been completed. We may change this plan and attempt to step up delivery of some items, but this depends highly upon what can physically be easily packaged together, and the related shipping costs. Website &amp; Forum Updates: As some may have noticed, our websites (for the game and the company) have been out of date for some time, and we have let our online presence and social media fall to the wayside. We do still have a website update in the works, though progress has been slowed. But when we are able to update the site(s), we still hope to create an area where backers can log in to download current and past versions of the game, rather than being limited to the single build available on Humble. Closing Scribbles... Again, thank you so much for your continued patience, support, and understanding. The Delvers (and the Rogue especially) miss you as much as we are sure that you miss them. We hope you will drop your thoughts in the comments, or if you have more specific concerns and questions, please reach out through direct message or by emailing us at <email>. Thank you for reading! YouTube: <url>— the holiday season + tax season are always a hectic time of the year. We also just moved into a better and more cost-efficient office arrangement, and while it did keep us busy for a bit moving boxes and desks, it should help improve our productivity with a better working environment. We’ve been continuing to whittle away at the features that are blocking the more interesting progress on the game, and are definitely gaining ground. Our next update should have some more concrete news in this regard. We have one last big round of bug fixes to undergo before we can fully recombine the updated physics code into the level generation code, but the details on that make for a boring update this time around. So as promised in our previous update, we have gathered some technical questions from fans and backers, and have compiled in-depth answers below! And beyond that, we have some new level concept art for your viewing pleasure. Backer Technical Questions: Q from Sean H: I'll stick to the [question] that intrigues me the most, which is weapon / loot / droppable item spawning. Would love to hear how you guys are approaching that. A: Thanks, Sean, for sending in our first question! There are several layers to this answer, so we’ll go through it in steps (some of which are still in development): The player’s random “seed” will determine the level layouts and everything that spawns. We have a custom RNG (random number generator) that makes the randomness even more random. But this means that once we add a seed input feature, players will be able to share seeds to complete challenge runs, or find specific items that are guaranteed to generate via a particular seed value. When a level loads, the game generates all items that can spawn (from chests and so on) at that time. Theses spawnable items are determined by several factors: Each object or enemy that can spawn or drop items is tied to a “loot pool” in a new database we are developing. This loot pool has several groups of loot, from common loot that has a high probability of spawning, to rarer (and more valuable) loot that has a lower probability of spawning. Each group can contain one or more weapons or items, and pieces of ammo, food, money, etc. Weapons and inventory items have special properties since they are more highly randomized. Each level has metadata that determines the probability that a particular type of weapon (sword, axe, etc) or other items will spawn. This is also influenced by the player character’s class and (upcoming) perks. The level also has a baseline “tier” value for spawnables, meaning that on average you may get a Tier-1 items on Level 1, and Tier-2 items on Level 2. However, this is also randomized, so you might find an item ranging 2-3 tiers above or below the baseline tier for the level. And in rare instances (through rare loot pools), you will eventually be able to find “out of depth” items that are several tiers above the normal range. All items have a single entry in our databases that define its base stats. But for weapons and items that use the upcoming random prefix/suffix system, this data and the weapon’s tier also define a set of affix pools from which the weapon can pull. This may cause a Broadsword to become a Swift Shard-hewn Broadsword. Since affixes also have a tier of their own, weapons will typically pull from affixes within 2-3 tiers of their own tier, but they can (rarely) pull from much higher tiers as an unexpected bonus. Q from Doomspeaker: Can developers (or modders) add hand-designed components into the levels, even though they are now procedurally generated? And how would this work? A: The answer is yes! The details, though, are a bit more unclear at this time :) With the move towards having complete procedural generation, the previous method we used to integrate hand-designed bits into the procedural system — where whole rooms were randomly placed next to each other — is no longer viable. For those who may not have caught the preceding updates, we made the decision to shift toward more fully-procedural generation due to the difficulty, time, and expense involved in creating hand-designed randomizable components which ultimately did not feel as uniquely random as we had hoped. But the new procedural system creates much more interesting rooms, following the same rules we set for our design team. Now we just need to tie our previous hand-design feature back into this system, so that our designers can re-integrate more complex “set-piece” rooms, puzzles, and traps. The good news is that the engine still has the same fundamental capabilities (i.e. being able to make rooms in Tiled and importing that data into the game). We merely need a new “glue” layer or integration layer to make this work within the procedural system. We have several ideas on how best to do this, however, we’ve not attempted any of them just yet. The most direct way, albeit limited, would be to allow individual rooms to import components of explicit sizes that the procedural generation system could slot into conforming spaces. For example, a 5x5 block room could request a 2x3 block Tiled file and integrate it within its allotted space… or it could request a full 5x5 Tiled file and replace itself entirely. We simply need to introduce a kind of “metadata” that can look up a Tiled file puzzle-piece, and insert it into the procedural generation algorithm’s workflow. The devil is definitely in the details with regards to that. But the bottom line is that we still 100% plan on supporting hand-designed rooms, and hopefully also hand-designed levels. Environment Art Update: For those of you who watch our Twitch livestreams or check out our YouTube channel from time to time, you may have seen our Creative Director working on some zone environment concepts. The images below are rough, low detail sketches that are intended to visualize the colors and atmosphere of each zone. You may have also seen a couple of these in previous builds, but the rest are new to this update. Enjoy! Closing Scribbles Livestreams are now on Wednesday nights, from 6:30pm – 7:30pm CST. (It's been moved back half an hour). Streams are viewable on our Twitch channel at twitch.tv/pixelscopic , and we usually announce any schedule changes on Twitter. We also cross-post the videos to YouTube at youtube.com/pixelscopic so that you can view them later. We hope you’ll join us and collaborate with some ideas of your own! As always, thank you for reading! Twitch Livestreams: <url>’ve been continuing to fine-tune and enhance the random generation of rooms and levels. For better or worse, the work has grown increasingly technical, and we realize that the finer points of software pattern recognition and the rules of wall-spawning may not seem as interesting as things like enemies and weapons. But this is where we find ourselves — in a literal and figurative maze of code-related minutia. Instead of another month of algorithm explanation, what we’d like to do for December is open up a forum for technical questions. If you’d like to know about the inner workings of any of our systems, from dungeon generation to the effects system, attack timing to weapon spawning, please email us at <email> with the subject [DDrop Tech Question] . Or you can simply comment below! We will fill up a blog post with much more detailed responses than would fit within a Kickstarter update, and feature the link in next month’s update. In the meantime, we will let the following images speak for themselves. These are zoomed-out layouts were captured while generating rooms normally in the engine — no custom design, Photoshop tricks, or hacks. We are still (temporarily) using placeholder art, to make sure that everything is working properly and has no visual or placement bugs. The sky texture (while made from in-game art) was added in Photoshop, since the system is not currently designed to render sky areas this large. The following images reveal what we call "Island Rooms" — rooms with no outer walls, suspended over empty space. Many have interior pillar-like wall areas, which look as though they support the room from below, or hold up the floor above. Content Cornucopia What would the holidays be without a dungeon full of edible goodies? Following the tradition of its roguelike heritage, Delver’s Drop will have loads of food items so that you can fill up your character’s health, stamina (special meter), and benefit them in other ways. So while there is no “food clock” or starvation, it would be wise to keep your character stuffed with nutrients! Starting from the very first Alpha release, diligent Delvers could find bean soup bowls squirreled away in breakable boxes. The selection of foodstuffs has vastly improved since then to include breads, meats, cheeses, and other treats. The idea behind the large variety is that each individual consumable item will have effects that affect short-term play, helping you out in a single play session, but not carrying over to your more permanent character stats. However, not all food you find within the Drop will be fresh and nutritious; meat from monsters and living plants is not always advisable, and some food may be spoiled. And while they may still refill some health for those desperate for the HP boost, spoiled food may pose other hazards to your overly-epicurious hero. So in the spirit of the season, allow us to present you with a small sampling of foods and their proposed effects. Happy Holidays everyone! Baked Goods Breads are the safest and commonest staple to consume, since they will seldom be found spoiled. They offer health with few other side benefits (or detriments) – no additional nutrients, just empty, wonderful carbs! Harder breads may provide a regen effect over time instead of instant healing. But if the player is lucky enough to find a pizza-like treat that has not yet hit its expiration date, he or she might benefit from a plethora of nutritious benefits and buffs. Meats For those looking to not only heal themselves but also boost their attack and defense, protein-rich meat will do the trick. It is often found spoiled, and enemies may eat it before you have the chance, so a nice fresh steak is a rare find indeed (no pun intended.) And while many creatures in the Drop will leave their meat behind upon death, the player must be cautious. Depending on the monster, this meat might heal a little HP, but also initiate a slow-acting poison. Other meats might grant strange benefits, even bestowing some of the enhancements of the enemy from which they spawned! Vegetables Most common vegetables will improve your dexterity, speed, and mobility. From carrots that improve your range of vision and aim to celery that helps to… well we don’t actually know what celery does for anyone. Some more interesting vegetables include Popeye-esque spinach that powers up your attacks for a short time, as well as onions and garlic that repel monsters with their pungent odors. Fruits The Apple is an iconic fruit used in video games — ranging from Gauntlet to Suikoden — and would probably just grant a nice chunk of health. But we had some fun with the other fruit ideas, including bananas that cause you to temporarily lose traction and slip about, and some bitter fruits like lemons and persimmons that might steal a tiny bit of HP in exchange for a huge benefit. We figure that the intrepid Delvers can make lemonade even without sugar, but on the sweeter side we are working on peaches that grant regen in exchange for sticky feet, and cherries that provide additional explosive power to your bombs. Drinks &amp; Potions Like most other RPGs, Delver’s Drop will feature various potion and elixir bottles that can be carried in your inventory and consumed at will. This differs from other food and drink items, which must be consumed immediately. Any open drink, such as a goblet or mug, must be consumed on-the-go in the dungeon like other food items, and cannot be taken with you. Aside from a classic healing potion, the drinks themselves usually offer little health benefit in terms of hit-points. But what they do not provide in raw HP, they will more than make up for in terms of over-the-top buffs and status effects. If you ever happen to drink a little too much Howl Nectar, you will definitely have a wild and exciting night, but you may regret it in the morning... All this Food.. in a Dungeon? Those of you who prefer realism and intentionality in their games and fiction worlds may be asking, “okay so I get that monsters drop meat… but who is making all of this fresh bread and hot cocoa?” And while we like that our random foods are some of the more whimsical items in the game, it is our thinking that they are indeed possible in the world. For one, there are royal guard outposts on many levels of the dungeon, and these would require occasional food provisions. And while most other denizens of the Drop are less than sane and healthy, the castle spire that surrounds the Drop dungeon was once a thriving metropolis. It is not too far-fetched to imagine that a decent trade might be made by an entrepreneurial survivalist chef, in exchange for weapons and gold. And even among the insane, who would want to harm a shopkeeper who bakes delicious frosted goodies, or concocts intoxicating elixirs? Have some ideas for food items? Check us out on our next art livestream (see times below), where we often dream up crazy ideas with viewers like you and sketch them on the spot! Closing Scribbles LIVESTREAM SCHEDULE CHANGE: Until further notice, we have decided to move livestreams to Wednesday nights, from 6:00pm – 7:30pm CST. These are viewable on our Twitch channel at twitch.tv/pixelscopic . We hope this time works for you, but if you happen to miss a stream, you can watch them later in our feed. We also post them to YouTube within a week or two at youtube.com/pixelscopic . We hope you’ll join us and collaborate with some ideas of your own! As always, thank you for reading! Twitch Livestreams: <url>’s costume. If you have ever considered it, tell us who you would cosplay as in the comments! Development Dive Before you continue reading, please be aware that all images still feature placeholder art for testing purposes. Over the past month we’ve been working on the walls in an attempt to completely finish the visual side of the level generation system. The additional benefits are that we have been making the environments more interesting as we go, and have also eliminated visual bugs that have plagued our walls / doors for some time. The most interesting new items include a set of “wall objects”, such as vents, windows, and paintings. These can be randomly injected into walls in each level. Beyond their decorative appeal, the coolest thing about these new objects is that they can be interactive on a case-by-case basis. A vent might be a spawner for bats and rats, a fireplace might emit fiery elementalings or jets of flame, a painting might reveal a hidden switch, and a window might allow healing pollen to occasionally drift into a room. Another thing we’ve amped up are the floating “ceiling” objects that you may have seen in previous builds. These will appear as out-of-focus silhouetted sprites that can be drawn above wall layers, and give the room a real sense of depth and ambience. The ultimate goal is to have a handful of static and animated sprites both inside and outside a room, giving us some groovy aesthetic options. For instance, in the image above (which is also placeholder art for now), we quite easily created a spooky tree-covered area. The same system could fill a room with haphazard pipes, or giant spider webs. This has opened up huge possibilities for making our environments feel like real places, rather than shallow shoebox-y rooms. With these items almost complete, we hope to put the last nail in the coffin of environment visuals. In the meantime, we are also working on controls and equippable items, as well as prepping for the reintroduction of our (now vastly improved) Endless Drop survival mode. ------------------------------------------------ Art Harvest For this spook-themed update, we’ve gathered up some of our most ghastly enemies. Enjoy! The following images are also in-progress sketches, with shading and highlights to come later! Some designs may also be subject to change. Cultist Settlement Occupants Shrouded in mists emitted by the Spoilmire Swamps far below, the Cultist Settlement is awash with the confusing influence of Muddle. It is full of demented beings — some of whom follow the cult’s beliefs, and others who simply thrive in the area’s pollution. And deep within the mazes of long-forsaken mining shafts and shanty dwellings, former denizens and servants of the castle are slowly losing their humanity. The Cult claims that they seek a way down to a lake of Murk far below ground, believing it to be the only way to cleanse themselves of suffering. Spoil Monstrosities These creatures are not natural beasts, but rather the chimerical spawn of the Spoilmire’s putrid influence. Taking a variety of twisted shapes, their forms are random amalgamations created from the mutated remains of biological organisms that succumbed to the swamp’s corruption. They are the most feared of all monsters; their gelatinous flesh is poisonous to the touch, they are often covered with venom-injecting spines, and they can emit noxious goo and gases with lethal effect. And with no instincts other than hunger, they consume and kill without reason or compassion. Echo Ghosts These are spirits caught between the universal planes, revisiting places they clung to in life, seeking those that they remember, or pursuing lost dreams. Truly an echo of their former selves, they often forget their identity in the pursuit of their dying wishes, or the wishes of those they served. They attack with the spiritual element of Echo, which takes the form of banshee-call sound waves, ghastly strands of cloth, and sickly virescent flames. These ghosts materialize via Echoplasm, a not-quite physical goo that is nearly unaffected by physical damage. To kill them, the Delvers will have to experiment with elements such as Fury, Hush, Grim, and Howl. ------------------------------------------------ Lore Excavation (Re)Introducing The Sorcerer! Guild: The Shade Whispers Best Weapon: Spirit Bottles, which shoot Echo projectiles Specialties: They sap Echo-based spirit energy from living beings to create more powerful magical concoctions. They can also use their arts to influence Echo beings and create Echo-based illusions. Occupation: Purveyors of (often illegal) potions, tinctures, and spirits. They typically run elixir shops that serve as the legal front for their less-legitimate services. Goals: Sorcerers are manipulative climbers of the social ladder, and trade in political favors and influence among the nobility. Many hoped to one day rise out of their middle-class merchant life to become nobles themselves, but their Delver status is at odds with this temptation. Description: Lovers of flattery and practitioners of the same, Sorcerers are often self-absorbed and greedy. They have a penchant for gambling, decadent living, and conspicuous spending in attempts to increase their social standing. They rely on magical substances to forget their past deeds and to ease the burden of their magical capabilities — or to enhance their power when needed. And while they are often swayed by many temptations, Sorcerers can be relied on for their encyclopedic knowledge (and reverent respect) of the spiritual realm — its powers, its properties, and its grave dangers. ------------------------------------------------ Closing Scribbles As always, thank you for reading! Please be sure to follow us on each and every one of our numerous social media platforms, and remember that we stream every week on Twitch! Our show currently occurs on Saturdays at 1pm CST, but we are considering moving to a new schedule soon. Just follow us on Twitter, since we always announce stream times there before we go live. Twitch Livestreams: <url>’re enjoying the beginning of autumn as much as we are —if you're in the northern hemisphere, that is. We know that you are all looking forward to a new build, and while it is not quite imminent, we are making amazing progress. If we haven’t already mentioned it, the upcoming build(s) will focus on “Endless Drop” mode. We decided to put our focus here since it will be the best test of the new randomly generated room system, and will offer tons of jump-in/jump-out replayability. Once new systems and features are tested in Endless Drop mode and are satisfactory, we will start to tie them together with progression features in Campaign mode. But the immediate goal is to make Endless Drop our new fast-iteration testbed for every newly added feature, so that you our early access players can provide feedback as we continue to build &amp; iterate. We are also still planning to launch the next build not only via Humble, but also on our upcoming backer-login page (on the Delver’s Drop site). This will allow you to download older builds, as well as more experimental intermediate builds as we go. It will also give you more regular updates on our progress, and will hopefully encourage opportunities for feedback via our forums. Development Dive The month of September was mostly spent building out the “Effects” system — not visual effects, but rather special status effects and alterations to player/enemy status. These include everything from damage over time (setting things on fire, or imbuing poison), to regeneration, speed boosts provided by equipment, and any other modification to data or AI that one could dream up. There are obviously some limitations any such system, but we hope you will be impressed with the depth and breadth we’ve been able to achieve. The number of Effects we can create is almost unlimited, since any one “status effect” can be a sum of up to 10 stat modifications (or “sub-effects”). Obviously we don't want Effects to be too crazy and unpredictable, so we would seldom apply 10 sub-effects. The idea is to delicately use stat modifications in combination — such as reducing both acceleration and top speed, while increasing traction and friction (decreasing momentum sliding) to create a "sticky feet" effect. Effects can be timed — set to take effect after a delay, or set on an increment and triggering every few seconds. But effects can also be instantaneous, or have only a chance of triggering. So you could have a dagger that does very low damage on its own, but has a chance to make its target explode for lots of damage. Effects can also cancel, counteract, or stack upon each other, meaning that layered effects can also cause unpredictable yet interesting results. But any given stat can only be modified by so many effects at any given time. Since each effect in our system can also be marked as good or bad (buff or debuff), we can also choose whether a “cleansing” (effect-canceling) spell would remove only bad sub-effects, only good sub-effects, or both. Lastly, effects can also change the material your body or shield is made of, or give you a barrier of a certain material. This means that you could coat an enemy in flammable oil, then set them on fire for bonus damage. But if their body is fundamentally made from stone (or armored by stone), they may still not take substantial damage, since the oil is treated as a separate “overlaying” material. Here's a further list of hypothetical effects this system allows: A 'stop' spell which nullifies all physics sub-effects (like speed boosts) and then sets max speed to 0. Snake’s venom could temporarily poison (damage over time) and slow the player, as well as cause paralysis, preventing attack abilities. A delayed healing potion would wait 10 seconds and then give you health. A spell could create an absorptive fire barrier around you, greatly reducing all incoming fire damage. An character's special ability could drain all of your SP, but would increase the player’s speed speed, add extra knockback to all attacks, and instantly stun enemies when struck. A “doom” spell might do nothing for 30 seconds, and then do incredible damage. Next up on the development agenda — we are moving back to room generation. Currently we are randomly spawning destructible crates and treasure chests, and will then proceed to enemy generation, interactives (switches, etc), and anything else needed for Endless Drop generation! Lore Excavation The Elements (fire, ice, etc) are tied quite closely to the historic lore we’ve created for the unique world and universe of Delver's Drop. And while the gameplay system is functionally similar to systems found in other games (D&amp;D, Pokémon, Final Fantasy, etc), we are aiming for a nuanced approach. As is the case in those games, attacks from elemental spells and weapons cause greater damage to some foes, in a rock-paper-scissors fashion. But we are also designing our system to cause bonus effects that offer tactical advantages and disadvantages in combat. So rather than applying simple damage multipliers, various elements will give the player additional benefits and gameplay options. And as in the Zelda games some elements may be used to solve puzzles within dungeons — but while we may have a mostly ice-based and a mostly fire-based zone, we are not creating a series of elemental dungeons that require constant damage type juggling. The goal is to encourage players to try various elements and rise to new challenges with ingenuity, rather than railroad them through a single set of solutions that hamper their play style. Now for the lore behind them... The Element names, their symbols, and their oppositions may still be subject to change (very slightly)... so tell us what you think! The Temperaments In the Delvers’ lore, the elements are known as the “Temperaments” of the universe, and are forces of cosmic energy and existence. They define the behavior of matter, energy, and spirit in the game’s mythology — not unlike our own universe’s subatomic forces and particles. And while the elements do tend toward the basic RPG standards of Fire, Ice, and Lightning, our goal has been to give them broader, more evocative definitions. Since these Temperaments influence the behavior of all of reality from physical matter to emotion, their mythological principles cover a much wider domain than simple heat or cold. Some of the elements are more closely aligned with one type of existence (matter, energy, spirit), but they are able to manifest in any plane. For example, the earth and stone-like temperament Mantle is primarily exhibited through matter, but can also be exhibited in the Spirit plane. Since the nature of matter is defined by the Temperaments, they can be thought of like the nature of molecule-level particles — like the Greek Elements were thought to behave. In Delver’s Drop, the most basic, inert matter is called Sod (which you could think of as base Protons/Neutrons). But almost all Sod conforms to one or more Temperaments, and in this case, it creates stone and soil based on varying degrees of Mantle and other Temperaments affecting the matter in question. The Temperaments exist on a chart that indicates their opposites and compliments. Any element directly horizontal across the chart is opposed — so you will see Hush (Ice) and Fury (Fire) directly opposite. This means that one can easily cause great damage to the other — fire damage greatly harming ice monsters, and ice damage inflicting extra damage on fire monsters, and so on. The Temperaments on the left side of the chart are generally life-giving and constructive in nature, relate mostly to physical matter, and exist to order and refine reality. The Temperaments on the right side frequently exist as unpredictable energy, and tend to be more destructive. The items in the center of the chart are transitional states and interactions, as well as more supernatural or magical elements. They oppose each other vertically, with Arcane versus Grim, and Echo versus Howl. Flux and Muddle oppose each other horizontally. Each element has a powerful patron deity or source, called a “Temperamental” — a personification of unpredictable cosmic will that shapes the universe through fluctuating power. From weather to the crashing waves, wildfires and lightning strikes, these shifts in energy are the result of the Temperamentals waging war and play with one another. Their battles and alliances are temporary and ever-changing; they are entities of irrationality, who seldom communicate with mortals and serve their own unknowable and immutable ends. They have little or no ultimate goals or purposes — they are simply celestial wills that act according to the nature of their Temperament. Now that we’ve explained the existence and relationships of the Temperaments, we will give a description of each individually: SPLENDOR — The ultimate form of existence in the temporal realms, Splendor causes all things that it positively influences to become more true to their nature — a more refined or pure expression of their purpose. You could think of this element like Light or Holy in other games, and it is indeed the element associated with the Sun, as well as the gods and Celestial Beasts that are the allies of mankind. Splendor radiates with an irresistible golden light, which can be focused into a destructive beam with the power of laser and the heat of a star. This element also gives metals like gold and silver their glow, and their timeless quality of resistance to age and tarnishing. Splendor is also the only Temperament that can truly oppose and damage the Murk, its shadowy opposite. MURK — A black fluid-like substance that consumes and assimilates all that it touches, Murk is the bane of the physical and spiritual universe — a tangible form of the principle of subjugation. The Murk Ocean is slowly attempting to eat away at all of reality. It is anti-matter and causes all forms of destructive acid. Anything it absorbs is converted into Murk, causing the substance to expand through consumption and assimilation. It can eat through anything in time, though the densest and most impervious substances such as pure Shard (a super-hard mineral) may withstand it for eons. But the Murk also corrupts the energy and spirit realms, turning them toward its alignment. And unlike the other elements, Murk sometimes seems to behave as if it has a greater will or purpose... THRIVE — The element of plant life and living growth, Thrive is the expression of boundless energy and strengthening sustenance. It is positively influenced by Splendor, and drinks up the sun’s light to energize itself. Thrive magic is the basis for most healing in the world, from plant-based poultices to healing spells. Thrive and can also continually rejuvenate living creatures with its energy — and for this reason, Thrive creatures are notoriously hard to defeat. With its properties of health and rejuvination, Thrive also opposes Spoil, the element of poison and rot. SURGE — The Temperament of rushing water, Surge has an almost irresistible strength of motion. Most force magic is based on Surge and its powerful currents and crashing waves. While it is not used to heal wounds as often as Thrive, it can protect and replenish living beings, energizing them and making their flesh stronger for a time. Its supernatural aspect boosts morale and can revive a spirit from near-death. With its matter-strengthening properties, it opposes the destructive cutting energy of the lightning element Sunder, but is also susceptible to its shock. MANTLE — The nearly unshakable element Mantle causes stone and bone to be hard, heavy, and brittle. Mantle magic forms shields and buffers against damage, and hardens weapons to improve their heft and durability. Master smiths are consequently masters of the manipulation of Mantle. And while Mantle and Surge often war with each other as water erodes stone, they create an uneasy cycle that forms and refines matter. Mantle’s ability to bury and seal off through mountains of matter opposes the destruction of Blast, the element of explosions. It can also give the mind and spirit fortitude, bolstering morale and maintaining sanity. HUSH — Named for the silence of a snowfall, Hush is the Temperament of the cold, ice, and the tranquility and stillness of meditation. As the opposing force to the Fury of fire, it also calms emotions and can quiet even the spirits of the dead by nullifying opposing magics. But just as meditation is an essential element of martial arts, Hush contributes to the biting edge of ice and winter, and its patient cold can often absorb the onslaught of its foes. Consequently, it can be used to freeze or slow enemies, as well as attack directly with icy blades. FURY — Heat, Fire, and uncontrolled passion and anger are the attributes of Fury. Though it is the most commonly destructive element existing in the natural world, it also has many uses in society if properly maintained and nourished. But given the chance, this temperament will break free of control, and cause rampaging wildfires, or fervid riot. Some practitioners can use Fury to induce a berserk rage in enemies and allies, making them stronger and more immune to pain, while simultaneously depleting their life and removing their logical inhibitions. BLAST — It is unstoppable force that opposes the “immovable object” of Mantle. The element of Blast causes explosions, earthquakes, volcanoes, and all forms of rupturing destruction. Used by alchemists in the formulation of gunpowder, Blast propels bullets and fuels grenades. The force of its blasts causes direct damage and knocks back targets, but it also damages and disorients through its incredibly loud sound waves. Consequently, it has a symbiotic relationship with Lightning by causing the chain-reaction effect of thunder. SUNDER — The element of unbridled destructive manipulation, Sunder’s lightning bolts cut through reality to control and lock down that which it cannot slice through. It lashes out as electricity, and can completely stun and innervate those that it touches. Its energy easily spans across the physical and spiritual realms, and its manipulative energies can be used to temporarily jump between planes by cutting through the fabric of reality. Its energy is often unleashed by the Murk; thunderstorms are the dangerous result of Murk becoming entangled in clouds of air and water. This mixture creates random Sunder lightning as a violent byproduct, as the elements come into conflict and then disperse as rain. SPOIL — The cause of all forms of corrosion, rot, mutation, and poison, Spoil is both entropy and the twisting of reality toward the Murk’s destruction. Spoil opposes Thrive by bending living matter and perverting it, creating horrible monsters and sickening diseases, and all forms of (physical) undead creatures. Ultimately, it twists living things into zombified and mummified fungi creatures that hunger for flesh and instinctively seek dissolution in the Murk. The Spoilmire swamps spread across the land like a cancer, and are the source of the Gobels and other malevolent chimera that plague humanity. Spoil energies also twist the supernatural realm, and often hinder spirits on their journey. ECHO — Purely spiritual beings reside in their own realms, but spiritual energies flow through and between all realms, physical and otherwise. A being’s spirit is the energy of its will and purpose, its innermost identity. If this identity is distorted or this will unfulfilled, therefore making a spirit unable to complete its journey from one realm to the next, then the spirit may be trapped between realms as a spiritual Echo. Theses ghosts tend to linger where they once existed, unable to find rest. In this way, malleable spiritual energy exhibits the temperament of Echo, and any inert matter manipulated to allow these ghosts to physically manifest is called Echoplasm. Free Echo spirit energy can also be harnessed by Sorcerers to create illusions and offensive magics, and can find use in healing potions by restoring the diminished spirit and psychological maladies in others. MUDDLE — The least energetic of the elements is Muddle, a transitionary temperament caused by the paradoxical mixture of opposing principles: heat and cold, life and unlife, energy and stasis. Muddle manifests as grayish clouds of smoke, dust, and mud, and as the byproduct of the interactions of elements that results in the loss of their own temperaments. These interactions result in a confused, nearly inert mess of swirling smoky matter. Muddle smogs are therefore often present on the fringes of the Spoilmire swamps, where fungi release them as they consume and convert plant and animal life. It may come as no surprise that Muddle attacks and magics cause status effects like confusion, blindness, and dizziness. FLUX — The element of wind, weather, and adaptable energy, Flux can clear the hazes of Muddle, but is itself somewhat transitionary. However, it is manifest in the transfer and transformation of matter and energy, rather than the stagnation and contradiction that causes Muddle. Flux governs the interactions of the elements and energies in the physical world, both pushing them toward change, and itself being a result of their sweeping interactions — it is the wind that results from explosions, the air that allows a fire to breathe and grow, and the same air that conducts the Hush cold into water, forming it into ice. Flux magics can be used for increased speed, reflexes, and evasion, and can aid in quickening attacks and making them more accurate, or diverting and deflecting enemy attacks. ARCANE — The element that should never have existed, Arcane is a manipulation of the natural order of the universe. One can think of it as all forms of experimentation, from unnatural alchemical reactions, to the bending and manipulation of energies, to the magi-mechanical energy that powers golems and machinery. Imagine an Arcanist’s lab as that of a mad scientist: full of bubbling green fluids, convection tubes, and tesla coils. Arcane can increase the power (and unpredictability) of other elements, and is the source of flammable and highly conductive fluids like oil. In its most powerful forms, Arcane energies can bend the fabric of reality, influencing time and space. Though incredibly difficult to control, it is thought that Arcane energy can even reverse time, revive the dead, or keep someone alive forever — but there is always a cost when reality is bent to the breaking point. GRIM — The cold, logical, and mathematical limitations of the universe are represented by Grim — created by the first deities to impose order and restraint against chaos. It is the finality of the grave, the weight of gravity, and the indestructible quality of adamantine Shard. Grim does not manipulate energy or matter, so much as completely stop other energies and temperaments. It opposes Arcane by attempting to halt its manipulation, bringing reality back into order and stopping time until it can resume its natural flow. Its properties can also withstand the Murk, but unlike Splendor is not very useful for offensive magic against Murk or other elements. Its magic manifests as spectral chains and stakes, and can even trap and slow spiritual energies much as Cold Iron is anathema to the Fay of European legend. HOWL — The feral temperament of beasts and wild things, ancient beings and primal spirits, Howl is the element of survival and the natural order of will of the pack. Exhibited in both the savage roar and the mating call, this element exhibits animalistic and social powers and intimidation, as well as physical attraction and the protective instincts of the family. It is irrational, and governs by instinct and emotion rather than logic. It is a kind of spiritual energy opposed to Echo, since it represents the confident power of life and opposes Echo’s dithering energies of surreal unlife. Closing Scribbles That's it for this month. As always, thank you for reading! Please be sure to follow us on each and every one of our numerous social media platforms, and remember that we stream each Saturday at 1pm CST! Twitch Livestreams: <url>’s a few days behind schedule!). We’re quite excited to tell you all about our new dungeon generation improvements! Development Dive When looking at screenshots below, please be aware that all of the art is for testing purposes only, and there may be layering issues and other visual bugs! These will be fixed soon — our programmers are simply focusing on the big-picture of level generation at the moment. As you will know from our previous updates, our programmers have been working hard on a fully procedural level generation system. At the end of last month, we had the ability to create a “critical path” (the player’s pathway through a room), and build a room shaped to it. But there was nothing to stop players from taking shortcuts right to the end of the room, and to prevent this we needed to create in-room barriers. Over the month of August, we’ve begun lining the critical path with obstacles so that the player must complete all of the room’s challenges (sometimes in order) before moving on. These walls, pipes, and chains/rails also add variety to the room, and will generate a large portion of a dungeon’s theme and aesthetics. The first step in this process was adding what we’ve called “sub-walls” (smaller block-walls that appear to be the height of the character) between sections of the critical path. Our goal was to make the pathway look architectural and well-defined, but easily traversable. The next step was to add variety to these sub-walls, by replacing certain amounts of them with pipes or chains. The amount of sub-walls that are replaced, and what they get replaced with, is fully configurable by our scripters on a room-by-room basis. To add some variety to the outer boundaries of the room, we next added configurable properties to replace sections of the 3D “outer walls” with pits, making the room feel like a set of platforms suspended over empty space. The last process we’ve been working on is the ability for the room to occasionally line the pits with chains. The quantity and coverage of these safety chains will also be configurable — so easier rooms in early zones may contain more chained-off pit edges to help prevent the player from falling. Later rooms will contain increasingly exposed pit edges, making them even more deadly. We have several goals for the upcoming month or two, including the placement of destructible objects. However, we may also take a break from level generation to put some work into status effects, damage-over-time, and other special effects resulting from character perks / equipment. More on that at the end of September! Closing Scribbles We are also working on a big lore update featuring the Elements (fire, ice, etc) of the Delver's Drop world. It's almost finished, so we may turn it into a mid-month update, to tide you over until we have more development news at the end of the month. Here is a quick teaser of what's to come: LIVESTREAMS: You may be interested to know that we are changing our livestream time to Saturdays at 1:00 PM CST. Daylight savings is about to end for us later this month, so we’re sorry in advance if this makes our stream time funky for those in other time zones! We would like to start interacting more directly with all of you via the comments on the streams — so if you have thoughts or suggestions, please chat with us on Saturdays! We are also posting each episode to Youtube later, for those who can’t view the live show. SOCIAL MEDIA LINKS: Twitch Livestreams: <url>— The Pixelscopic Team Hello, Delvers! Get ready for a massive and exciting End-of-July Update. Over the last month, we have made an epic hoard of programming progress, which is demolishing our previous level design roadblocks and bottlenecks. The game is now able to generate full rooms on the fly, completely via programming algorithms. Read on! What are the benefits of full procedural generation? As mentioned in previous updates, we’ve been moving toward this higher degree of procedural generation as opposed to by-hand design. The old level generation system, while it did have some fun rooms/levels, wasn’t scalable. Designers had to put together every single room by hand, and hope that the game could effectively combine random elements, which were quite difficult to plan. This limited the random possibilities, limited the size of the rooms, and generally was not sustainable to build out the full game simply due to the hours necessary to create the desired amount of variety. We will still have certain aspects designed by hand (story areas, puzzles, special rooms, bosses), but the results of the full procedural generation are much faster, more flexible, and just as unique. Our algorithm also follows similar rules (probably even better rules!) compared to our previous best-practices for by-hand room design and creation. In other words, our design sensibilities are being implemented directly into the procedural generation code, in detail. Good game design is still the driving force, rather than relying on the crutch of a basic RNG (random number generator). It’s all still in process, but the exciting news is that as of now, we are confident that our procedural rooms will be at least as interesting and aesthetically pleasing as our previous hand-designs… if not more. And now the possibilities of room size/shape/gameplay variation are countless. So how does it work? In order to achieve these goals, the algorithm goes through several phases of generation, as listed below. The first three of these steps are programmatically complete (short of some bug fixes), with steps four and above still early in development or in the planning stages. Steps do not necessarily represent the final generation order via the algorithm: • Build the Basic Floor Space / Wall Structure — define the floor layout of the room itself, where the player can walk. • “Enhance” the Walls — make the walls feel more organic (less strictly grid-based), and make hallways feel more winding rather than straight and boring. • Auto-tile the floors with a random assortment of basic tiles (later to be improved with overlaid decorative tiles). • Make a “Critical Path” — a.k.a. the “planned” or intended primary pathway of the player through the room. • Create Fixed Barriers to block off portions of the room, which enforces portions of the critical path and adds exploration interest. These fixed barriers will include sub-walls, chains, pits, etc. • Generate Soft Barriers and Obstacles, including switch-operated gates, bomb-able barricades, and traps, in order to add challenge. • Add interest areas by placing breakable reward objects (such as crates, pots, treasure chests) and aesthetic or narrative objects (tables, chairs, statues) to complete the dungeon experience. • And obviously, add enemies! Notes about screenshots below: All images use placeholder art to some degree, so floors may appear flat and un-textured. Please also know that the images below are completely generated by the game — we’ve edited the contrast and colors a little bit so it’s easier to see the important details, but the room sizes, shapes, etc. and the screenshots themselves are all directly from the game’s normal render mode. Many are simply zoomed out via our debug controls, but they are still in-game shots. Creating Room Spaces The first step in making this new system was to create a room entirely via code. This first picture shows room generation at its most basic: the game simply creates a grid, marks sections of that grid as “free” (in other words, “traversable” areas where the player can walk), and places walls around those areas to enclose them. The bronze-gold “pillar” placement and wall-tiling are also automatic: Even this early on, the system was capable of making rooms several times larger and vastly more complex than any of our previous room shapes, which were tediously created/scripted by hand, and were often limited to simple geometric shapes like Tetris-pieces. Now we can procedurally generate a room thousands of tiles in size, in a fraction of a second: The above image is an actual in-game render, just zoomed out to about 3%. If you look very closely on the left side of the image, you can see the tiny pink speck. This is your character, the Rogue, which was rendered at a size of a 4 pixel square due to the zoom level. What you’re seeing is not even a “level” made of multiple rooms — it is a single room. This means our possibilities have increased by several orders of magnitude. But with great procedural power comes great developer responsibility — we will be restricting such generation to ensure that the game is interesting and goal-driven, rather than completely rambling, exploratory, and uninteresting. In other words, we are still generally aiming for a tightly-designed Link to the Past feel, rather than a Skyrim-esque sprawl. Layout "Enhancement" The next step was to make the room layouts more unique, and less strictly grid-based. So the original basic grid upon which the room is generated is “enhanced,” by choosing spaces where the walls are pushed inward or outward to create more variety. This can create rooms that feel architecturally geometric (grid-based), organic (more random / cave-like), claustrophobic, or exposed. The rate at which walls are altered is easily modifiable via our CSV data (modders ahoy!), meaning each zone can have a slightly different feel to its “architecture”. An example room, where the walls were pulled in or pushed out as often as possible (maximum “organic” feel), is shown below: Floor Tiling The third step in the new room generation system is tiling the floor. In the old system, all of the tiles had to be placed by hand. But now that the rooms are procedural, it means that the floors have to be generated as well. So based on our previous tilesets, we created a modified system, featuring several different sizes of totally randomizable tiles. This random flooring will be the “base layer” of the visual tiles (like a concrete or wood sub-floor), upon which other decorative tiles will later be dynamically placed. There are mini tiles, wide tiles, tall tiles, and double-sized tiles for visual variety — and the game can mirror and rotate them to make them look even more natural and non-repetitive. The examples below (using an obviously placeholder floor texture with letters), shows how some zones can have very gridded tiles: ...and others can have a random assortment of different sizes and shapes, with maximum randomization of mirroring / rotation: You may notice that currently some tiles are repeating near themselves, but we are working to ensure sure that the same tile is never repeated in immediate proximity. Developing the Critical Path So now the room layouts, walls, and floors have the maximum amount of variety and flexibility that we can create, within our given perspective and the constraints of our grid-based world. However, a well-designed room or level requires much more than that. Instead of randomly creating a room by just opening up chunks of floor here and there and putting walls around them, the generation algorithm needs to create a directed experience. Fundamentally, we need to generate a particular path with a beginning and an end, and interesting events along the way. This is where we began our most recent step — generating the “Critical Path,” or the intended minimum pathway through the room. NOTE: Those savvy in game design are probably asking “why is this step last? Shouldn’t the critical path be most important?” And you would be right! This step will actually occur first in the final algorithm — we just happened to work on this system most recently. Our Critical Path is not necessarily the 100% most efficient beeline from beginning point to endpoint — but rather a diverse “gameplay path” that requires the player to complete certain objectives in order. Those objectives might include walking from point A to point B, flipping a switch at point C and then back-tracking to B (or looping back to A) in order to proceed to D. It allows us to procedurally create challenges that must be passed in a certain order, as well as creating detours that are necessary for the completion of a room (or level). So for example, the system we are working toward will be able to create a room where the Drop Portal (the exit down to the next level) is generated behind a locked gate. The player can’t go through this gate without first flipping a switch elsewhere in the room — and importantly, this switch must somewhere along the critical path before the locked gate. (Otherwise the player will get stuck). This piece of the code is still very early in the making, but the following screenshot shows a debug view of the world, with a (rather complex but linear) critical path highlighted in blue: Note that this room is 1) currently only generated immediately around the critical path, with no extra space or off-shoots, and 2) has not been “enhanced” with more random walls. These features will be grafted into the Critical Path system as it is finished. The algorithm will also need to erect barriers within the room in order to prevent the player from taking shortcuts. And as always, the length of the path, degree of path complexity (twists and turns), and the number of straights versus diagonals will all tweakable on a level-by-level and room-type basis, and able to be modded. This gives our designers/scripters the ability to create lots of variety, and avoid both overly-complex and overly-simple structures… as well as increase complexity as the player progresses. Closing Scribbles That’s all for our End-of-July Update! We hope that you’re as excited about the recent progress as we are. It’s difficult to express, but we’re sure most of you understand how huge of a leap these improvements are, compared to the previous versions of the game. We now have a truly randomized room structure, which further allows levels to be even more interesting and challenging. Please let us know what you think! We know that many of you are awaiting a new build, but please know that when it comes, all of the above features will be there — and Delver’s Drop will have gone from a game with limited variety (as in the previous builds), to a game with huge amounts of replay. Thanks as always for sticking with us! Twitch Livestreams (Fridays @3pm CST): <url>’ve been hard at work on several major game systems and some more imaginative art streams. We hope you enjoy the monthly update! Development News The focus of development this month has been to build out the AI system into something much more complex, nuanced, and interesting, in order to facilitate more challenging and strategic combat. Our goals are to make enemies feel natural, giving them a true “detection” system so that they can react to (and differentiate between) threats and prey, allow for different modes and behaviors for a single enemy, and create inroads for more challenging gameplay — such as some light stealth mechanics and other player strategies. The old AI system, while efficient, was hard-coded and difficult to modify. There were few behavior states, and we were relying too much on enemy movement parameters to give them uniqueness. The new system we’ve been working on reads from an AI database (spreadsheet CSV file) that is very easy to edit. This allows us (or modders) to add new and interesting AI behaviors in minutes. Previously, enemies could only target and track the player; they can now acquire different targets and change their behavior accordingly — based on line of sight, hearing range, being touched, being damaged, etc. With our fight-or-flight system, they can prioritize running from their predators over chasing prey, or decide to turn and attack their predators when low on health. They can search for an ally with the lowest health and try to heal them, or search for the creature (or player) with the lowest health and focus all their efforts on finishing it off. Enemies can go into an alert state when they hear prey — increasing their sight range on the fly, causing them to be more attentive; but they may only begin the chase once they visually spot something to attack. These are just some examples of what we’ve accomplished in the last few weeks. Our goal is to make these features highly demonstrable in the next build, creating example rooms where we hand-design scenarios to test out the AI system with specific enemy types. Our next goals are to (completely) finish the physics refinements, finalize the last remaining character control tasks, and move back to dungeon generation full-force. We hope to bring you some exciting news about dungeons in the next update! Lore Dive (And Art Livestream Catch-up): COMPANION SPRITES As unveiled in last month’s update, we’ve been occasionally brainstorming ideas for the companions/familiars on our weekly livestreams — which occur (almost) every week, on Fridays, 3pm CST, at http:/twitch.tv/Pixelscopic We’ve decided to officially call these creatures “Companion Sprites” in the mythos of the world. They are elementally-based spirit creatures that can be summoned through totems in dungeons, and appear as small, floating beasts and fantastical beings, from a discombobulated head to an exploding tunafish. Kind of like Pokémon-eque Patronus helpers, they can appear and vanish as needed, in order to aid the player through offense, defense, and other utility functions. The inspiration behind the Companions came from various mythologies around the world. We looked to mythology in order to come up with more unique and unexpected ideas — the thought was not to stay true to the source material or attempt to bring real-world myths into the Delver’s universe, but rather to remix mythological ideas into something new and creative, in order to give the Companions a bizarre twist. In other words, we wanted to make them one of the most twisted yet fun and colorful elements of the world. Based on one of our stretch goals, we will be adding the ability for a second player to take over control of a Companion in the main campaign, for a limited local co-op “co-star” mode. For those who want a strictly solo experience, have no fear: you’ll be able to find Sprite Companions in the game and use them without a second player — they will simply be AI-controlled. The artwork is still under development, and the names may not be final, but below we’ve selected a subset of the Companions and provided information about their inspirations and mythological sources. Meet a few of our favorite Companions! ——— SIREN ——— Greek mythology tells of women with the wings and beautiful songs of birds, luring men to their graves in the sea. From those myths, the Mermaid appears in lore across all cultures, a dangerous mix of fin and flesh. We took both of these concepts to deliver and all-encompassing Siren: a winged mermaid. She wears a Noh mask to pay homage to the Eastern interpretations of the Siren, and has a shock of wavy pink hair to denote her alignment with the Howl element. ——— BARGHEST ——— Based on British lore, the Barghest is a mix of ghost and wolf. Often said to herald death and known for its association with the grave, we gave it the Grim elemental influence. The Barghest hunts and haunts with eyes aflame, and this inspired us bestow Fury as its second element. And for who knows what reason, the mythological Barghest makes the sound of rattling chairs when it walks — so we gave it a wooden stool for legs. ——— KHEPRI ——— To the Egyptians, the scarab beetle rolling its ball of dung along the ground symbolised the forces that rolled the sun through the heavens. To avoid having too many animal-like Companions, we drew inspiration from the cartoon villain Archimedes, and his use of mechanical insects. Our scarab possesses the Arcane element, meant to add a mechanical, chemical, and clockwork-esque look to its mysterious power. The orb Kepri holds is to further symbolize its relation to the sun and also the moon, since in the Delvers mythology, Arcane energy is aligned with the Moon God. ——— WULVER ——— The Wulver is another werewolf-inspired Companion based on traditional Shetland myth. This is one of our more peaceful creature inspirations, preferring to be by rivers and being very fond of fishing. With that in mind, we wanted to combine a large wolf and some angler element. This gave us a fish-eating dog with a fisherman’s cap. We added a few fishing hooks for earrings as the finishing touches for our aquatic werewolf, to further associate it with the Surge (water) Element. ——— KOHARA ——— Based on a Polynesian Goddess, Kohara, the Mother of all Tuna, is one of the most outlandish ideas we’ve worked on. Maori and Polynesian lore speak of a flash of lightning, out of which tuna are born to the ocean for the first time. Modeling our Companion after this idea, we wanted to make a creature that combined the volatile nature of lightning and thunder with a tuna fish, so we created what looks like an explosive Fish Stress Doll. The idea of a kamikaze tuna was too laughable to pass up. ——— SUBURBAN PHOENIX, aka Lawn Flamingo ——— This Companion was born from one of our contractors suggesting that the Thrive (plant) element be modelled after Topiary visuals, which lead us to a discussion of lawn ornaments. While it has been suggested that the Flamingo is the actual bird behind ancient egyptian legends of the Phoenix, we modelled our idea more on the quintessential Suburban Americana yard decoration. It may go without saying, but some ideas for Companions are meant to humorously break the fourth wall, just slightly. ——— AKANAME ——— This is perhaps one of the grossest Companions to date. The Akaname is a Japanese Yokai (ghost) that lived in outhouses. It is the personification of a fear that we have all felt at one time or another: the fear of using a restroom in the dark. In contrast to its foul and filthy mythology, our Akaname has become one of the cutest of the Companions. We joke that it ended up looking very muppet-like, more like a female Oscar the Grouch as opposed to a malevolent creature who waits to attack people while they’re on the can. Aligned with our Spoil Element, (the element of poison and decay), it was the logical elemental tie-in for a creature associated with unsavory of bathroom humor. ——— OROCHI ——— As our Companions have progressed, we have begun to set visual themes for each element, and as mentioned with the Akaname, the Spoil element has a subtle sewer theme. Based on the ancient Japanese tale of Kusanagi, Orochi is more or less a Hydra, sans regeneration. We dubbed our version the “Pipdra”, a portmanteau of “Pipe” and “Hydra” during one of our livestreams, as a way to combine the poisonous Spoil and the chemical/mechanical Arcane element. ——— STORM CROW ——— A great many legends across North America feature the Storm Crow, which foretells violent thunderstorms. But we also like the allusion to Norse myths relating to crows that arrive in the wake of battle. We had to give it a Valkyrie’s helmet and shape it to look like it was made of lightning, which ties it both to these mythological sources, and the elements in our universe. ——— A BAO A QU ——— The A Bao A Qu is an unusual folk tale centered around the Tower of Victory. Based in Malay legend, it is said to rest at the base of the stairs within the tower and follows those trying to ascend (an analogy for ascending to Nirvana). It is said to feel like peach fuzz if touched, and appears as a specter. So we clearly had to slap some eyes on a peach and gave it a cute, ghostly cloak to align it with the Echo (ghostly) element. Update Complete! Thanks again for sticking with us, and we look forward to bringing you lots of amazing Delvers news next month! Welcome to the Delver’s Drop End-of-Month Update for May 2015! Before we get started, we’d like to apologize about being a little sporadic with the Livestreams this month. We had several conflicts, and weren’t as consistent as usual. But we did have several guests, so hopefully that makes up for it! To see a list of past episodes, hop over to our forums: <url>’s Drop website some nice upgrades. We are unsure about the timeline, but we are planning to develop a customer portal on the site, where our backers can login and download a full archive of all versions of the game. As most of you may know, you can currently download and play the game via Humble. (If you never saw an email with your key, let us know via email at <email> and we’ll send your link!) However, that system is limited to the newest build, and we’ve received many requests to try out older versions of the game. We even occasionally like to go on a trip down memory lane, and play the *oldest* version, which pre-dates even the Kickstarter campaign! So the plan is to give all of you the ability to download and play these older versions in the near future. But be warned — they may be (probably are) quite buggy, and a few of the earliest are PC-only. We also hope that this will make it easier for some Kickstarter backers to download and play the game. Looking even further to the future, we will most likely use this web portal to provide many of your digital rewards. New Build on the Horizon We are working hard on a new build with some significant feature additions. However, the scope and playtime will be limited, since several system will still be undergoing revision. We have decided to focus on the basics of gameplay: controls, physics, and movement abilities. We are also striving to get some missing and long overdue systems up and running — such as adding several in-game sub-menus, and exposing the experience points and leveling systems. Some of these features may be rough and experimental, with more polish and balancing to come in the future. Physics As we’ve mentioned (probably more than once), progress has been slowed by some physics rework. This became necessary when certain game-y mechanics were introduced, which contradict some of the normal laws of physics… and produced pretty bad bugs. Sokoban-style, limited-direction pushable blocks would get permanently stuck on each other, like a left-moving rock against an upward-moving hard place. (Broken puzzles!) When we tried to modify character dashing and add some cool new mechanics, we hit the mathematical limits of the physics simulation. (Super-fast dashing could not be bug-free.) For the same reason, players could not throw objects all the way across the room… more like 5 feet in front of them. (Lame!) And finally, some of you may have also noticed many objects interpenetrating as if everything in the game were a balloon animal. (Just weird!) Anyway, all of that is getting fixed! It’s been a rather un-fun change to undergo on the programming side, but it means that player abilities and puzzles can now be a whole lot more interesting. As a huge added bonus, performance should improve dramatically on slower machines. Experience, Leveling, Skill Upgrades We have (theoretically) had experience points in the game for a long time. But it was definitely not visible to the player. And when we exhumed this bit of code from its sepulchral hiding place, it apparently counted XP for enemy kills until it reached 100 points… and then stopped. So now, suffice it to say that you can gain XP from enemy kills, and level up as you reach each scaling level threshold. For instance, Level 2 is reached at 1000 XP, then Level 3 after another 1250, and so on. (Obviously pending balancing). So what happens when you level up? This is where the long awaited Skills / Perks system comes into play! Each time you level, the character class you are playing as will gain at least 1 skill point. You can then assign this point to several active ability skills or passive perks. Some perks will only be unlockable once you meet other requirements. We are avoiding a very complicated prerequisite tree, and instead gearing the system toward maximum player customization. Just remember that the game will be 100% playable without grinding for levels, or assigning perks. We are emphasizing player skill over the numbers-game of level-grinding (more like Dark Souls), so that the game can theoretically be beaten with a Level-1, non-upgraded character. So for those of you who (A) hate wasting time grinding, or (B) love a challenge, we hope to accommodate your wishes! While the implementation of this system will be VERY simple in the upcoming build, we are making good progress, and are excited about showing it to all of you. Sub-Menus, Item Comparison Partly to accommodate the leveling and skill customization screens, we are working on a larger set of sub-menus. These will eventually also include a level map, achievement list, in-game settings (volume, etc), and an item/weapon info sub-screen. This last item screen is currently one of our highest menu priorities. Ever wondered why the game has had so many nonsense items that do very little damage, or knock the player backwards? The plan was to start the player with low-quality weapons in Zone 1 for narrative realism and added challenge, and then to introduce the idea of item comparison as better items are found. Very soon we will have implemented a menu state (inside of the pause menu flow) where you can look at the stats of any given item, and compare it to others you are carrying, or an item that you have just found in a treasure chest. This will allow players to pick only the best weapons, and ones for which their character class has greater affinity. Other weapons are still usable, but if they have low stats or are ill-suited for your character, you may want to cash them in or thrown them at enemies for bonus damage. The Item comparison sub-menu will help you make all of these decisions. We also enjoy giving the weapons silly names and descriptions, and we need a place to display this text so you can (hopefully) chuckle at our wit, and cry at our bad jokes. That’s all for this month’s development updates. But June looks to be a very promising month, so stay tuned! MEET THE CAST: SORCERER Gender: Male Guild: The Shade Whispers Occupation: Purveyors of (often illegal) potions and tinctures, the Sorcerer employs potent magic that manipulates spirit energy to benefit others or serve more shady purposes. Best Weapons: Spirit Bottles Goals: Sorcerers wish to increase their social standing and influence over others, or manipulate others to their purpose. Specialty: They sap spirits and energy from living plants, animals, and people, to create more powerful magic concoctions and tame powerful Echo ghosts. Description: Lovers of flattery and practitioners of the same, Sorcerers are self-important and have a penchant for gambling and conspicuous spending, in attempts to increase their social standing. They rely on magical substances to forget their past and to ease the burden of their magical capabilities — or to enhance them. Thanks Again! Thanks as always for sticking with us! And please show up for our Art Livestreams every Friday (usually at 3pm CST), or visit our forums , where we will be happy to hear your suggestions and feedback! Hello, Delvers! And welcome to our End-of-the-Month update. We’ll start with some development news, and then proceed with some tidbits from our artwork livestreams, and a bit of story and lore from the game. New &amp; Improved Controls As we mentioned last time, we’ve been hard at work on a new control scheme, with the goal of improving combat and the fluidity of player input. We’ve also added true aiming (via mouse or analog stick) which is undergoing the last pass of testing and refinement before we finalize the entire scheme. Aim: The player can now aim freely while standing still, and can aim while charging. We wanted to avoid a kiting scheme where the player can run backwards while stabbing enemies that are chasing them — we felt that a more traditional, tactical approach was preferable, and offered the right type of challenges to the player. However, we also wanted to give the player the freedom to plan more careful strikes and projectile shots. Hence the addition of aiming when stationary or moving slowly (in weapon charge mode). Dodge-Jump: This feature is still somewhat experimental, but very fun. Some of you may remember that we had a feature called “Shield Dodging” in previous builds. However, the controls for doing so were cumbersome. We’ve resurrected something similar to this Dodge, but have attached it to the Dash button, now located on the controllers’ B-Button (Xbox) or Circle Button (PlayStation). This will feel very familiar to Dark Souls players, and the feature will function very similarly to Soul’s rolling move. The player can dash in any of the 8 directions, and (bonus feature!) may also be able to use our Dodge-Jump to pass over small pits and obstacles. This will add a lot of variety to level traversal, as well as making evasion more strategic. Dash-Run: So what happened to our current Dash move? Well it’s still here… with some tweaks. We felt that it was a bit too powerful and offensive, so we have made the Dodge-Jump the more usable feature by comparison, and made Dashing require a little more planning and timing (since it's more powerful). So this updated Dash-Run move will be performed by holding the Dodge-Jump button down. The player will go through a brief charge-up time, then begin to dash. Think of it like the Pegasus Boots in Link to the Past — with a bit of charge-up time, you may be able to dash across an entire room. And the offensive nature of this move will improve with equipped shields and player skills, adding extra damage and knockback to enemies if you dash into them. Hang Out with us on Twitch! We’ve been steaming regularly at twitch.tv/pixelscopic , at 3 PM CST (Daylight Savings), aka GMT -5. We discuss various aspects of the game (and ramble off-topic A LOT), answer questions from the chat, and generally show off what we’re working on. We also run a weekly poll where those participating in chat can vote on the topic for the next stream. Our first stream back saw us working on the updated Elements List, from which status and elemental effects will be drawn. The Elements have been revised and given a better color scheme, and more unique symbols and particle styles, so that players won’t be required to memorize or identify colors to determine what an enemy or weapon is flinging at them. We also discussed the idea of Elemental Buffs that could be added to weapons from Elemental Forges found within the Drop. We also worked on the Elementalist class, touching up his color scheme to make him stand out from the other Delvers, and preparing him for animation. Armed with staves and branches, the Elementalist will serve as a mid-ranged magic user with some melee capability. And finally, our most popular stream topic! We began work on the art for the Companion Sprites — the familiars or spirit beasts that the player can summon in the game. They will assist the player in various ways, and are the source of the Local Co-Op function. We’re hoping that using them will be a fun addition for one or two players, while still keeping the game balanced. If you have suggestions on what sort of critters you’d like to see in the Companion Sprites list, we have a post on our forums here: <url>#new , where you can interact with the community and offer suggestions. Meet the Cast: Rogue Edition! Appearing on almost every piece of our concept artwork, the Rogue seems a good place to start (re)introducing our cast of... well... rogues and ne’er-do-wells. Garbed in the Purples of The Hangmen Hoods, the Rogue is the jack-of-all-trades character in Delver’s Drop. With decent speed and good traction while running, she’s a great match for beginning players and those well practiced with the game. Some of you may not know this, but we originally didn’t have a gender picked for the Rogue. We usually referred to it as “he” because… well who knows why. But when we first showed the game at PAX, several people mentioned that something about the animation, particularly the way the Rogue’s running animation looked, made her look feminine. So after several people asked if the Rogue was a girl, we decided to make it official… and we’ve never looked back. In the world of Delver’s Drop, there would also be male Rogues, but we couldn’t be happier to have our lovable charlatan lady-Rogue headlining all of our promotional materials. Full Bio: Gender: Female (as appears in Delver’s Drop) Guild: The Hangmen Hoods Occupation: Rogues wear many hats, working as con-artists and thieves, and are often employed to steal secrets from others. Best Weapons: Swords and knives Goals: Rogues desire gold, and will make other people’s fortunes their own with whatever tactics they need. Specialty: They discover more hidden treasure than anyone else; it is rumored that they can actually smell out gold and silver. They are also said to be capable of swinging a blade so fast that it cuts the air. Description: Flippant and full of self-irony, Rogues are witty smooth-talkers and sly rebels who antagonize those with pride or authority. They love to take the wealthy down a notch through verbal duels, pranks and hijinx, and obviously, knicking their gold. Ironically, Rogues give away most of the stolen goods and money because they find joy in acquiring it, not necessarily in keeping it. Rogues often learn random skills, making them a jacks-of-all-trades and allowing them to adapt to varied situations. For those interested in more the lore of the Delver’s Drop world or just keep up with the news and goings on here at Pixelscopic, they should check out the forums at forums.pixelscopic.com . Thanks Again! Thanks as always for sticking with us! And we hope that you show up for our streams every Friday, or on our forums, where we will be happy to hear your suggestions and feedback! As we’re sure everyone is aware, we’ve been out of contact for a long time. We sincerely apologize for the lack of communication. A combination of overwork, lack of time, life in general, and burnout has caused us to become negligent in our communication and PR. While we’ve stayed active and in touch with users on our forums, we have neglected our Kickstarter community and have been too silent about development — which is not good for you, or for us. So before we begin the update, we ask to you to forgive us for the long silence, as well as the slow progress. Why so little contact? As a very small company, it tends to feel like everyone has ten important things to do, and unfortunately anything that is not contributing directly to development (tasks like customer service, updates, livestreams, and social media) can easily slide to the back burner. But this procrastination means that you are out of the loop. Some may have believed we totally disappeared, which is definitely not the case. Delver's Drop has not disappeared, and is still in active development. We were (unwisely) waiting for several bits of good news or a new amazing build of the game to solidify, and that turned into a very unfortunate and long delay. And honestly, we have been a little depressed with the slow progress and lack of anything we feel is worthy of public display… in other words, we are probably too hard on ourselves and on the game. We incorrectly assumed that our backers would prefer to not be spammed with mediocre or insubstantial updates. The overwhelming response has been that everyone would prefer small updates to no updates, even to simply know that we are still alive. So from here on, we're going to do an update at least once per month , whether there is amazingly significant news, or just to let you know what is currently brewing. Obviously we’ll try to cram updates with juicy nuggets, but we hope that if those nuggets are in short supply, you’ll forgive us until the next update comes around a few weeks later. But the goal will be to fill them with blog-esque tidbits, anecdotes, and fun facts about development and the Delver's world. So what’s new? The best news is that we now have another part-time programmer! He started as an intern, but we quickly graduated him to working more directly on the game. The code is pretty complicated, so it may be a little while before our development speeds up. But it’s definitely a start. We also have a second evenings-and-weekends programmer who may help on additional features as he is able. Improved AI? Yes, please! Thirdly, we are partnering with Junklatch ( @junklatch on Twitter), a new indie support company run by a very knowledgeable and talented guy named Chris Dwyer. He will assist us with project planning to complete the game more efficiently, and advise us as we bring the game to market. Chris will also be helping with promotion and PR, specifically by showing the game at conventions. In fact, he recently showed Delver’s Drop in Junklatch's booth at Indiecade East. We will still exhibit (and hopefully see all of you!) at conventions like PAX Prime. However, we are cutting back on conventions in general (we chose not to go to PAX East this year), in an effort to be more financially conservative, and just spend more time and effort on development. Why the delays? Unfortunately on a game this complex (especially with our physics), a lot of our original goals became more difficult to achieve than we originally thought. Many aspects have taken much much longer than anticipated, and things have gotten tight for our business. Some of our team members have been working second jobs or side-projects to maintain personal stability. We’ve also undergone some life changes (one team member has a new baby!), and we have had to adjust as individuals and as a company. And then there was the time that a team member ended up with a broken hand, and had to learn to use a mouse left-handed, as well as type one-handed for about 2 months… not fun. What have you been working on? You would be correct in guessing that progress has been slow since our last update. As development has gone on, we’ve seen more and more where our game is thin and uninteresting. We’ve been trying to bring the focus toward what the game does well (combat) and to revise and improve what it does poorly (random generation and level navigation). We continue to believe (based on your feedback) that the majority of you would prefer Delver's Drop to be the best game possible, and we are striving to ensure this goal. Since the build last fall, we realized that several of the game’s systems are fighting against each other. Namely, the physics tend to fight against player controls, combat, and puzzle mechanics, so we have been attempting to reduce floatiness, and simultaneously make the game run better by optimizing and simplifying the physics system. We also feel that random generation and our level design in general actually make exploration less interesting than it should be, so we’ve been reconsidering their structure and implementation. We've also been designing increased depth in combat, since it is the most fun part of the game, but becomes repetitive quickly. We actually had a (very rough) prototype of 4-player competitive combat, but almost all play sessions devolved into button-mashing and trading blows like rock-em-sock-em robots. (Once we fix the camera issues and get 4-player UI in place, we’ll let you take a look.) But what this experiment showed us was that the combat definitely needed something more — a more agile dodge/dash, and some variety in attack types. Cue the fabled combo system, which is underway! We are even planning to add depth to the elemental system, with significance in the game's lore. (New and updated rune designs below): More importantly, we've been putting some extra effort into the controls in order to help the player feel more accurate and agile. We will soon have aiming with the mouse (or controller analog stick) implemented. This can be used when standing still or when charging up attacks, and will be especially effective for aiming projectile shots. We are not going full twin-stick, but adding this optional feature will help make combat more precise, fluid, and engaging. When will the game be released? A hard release date is something that everyone here would love to know, but we simply aren’t sure yet. We plan to release on Steam Early Access before we move toward a final release, and will likely allow our backers to play the game on Steam even earlier. However, we are dedicated to making the game much more robust and fully-featured before we will truly consider an Early Access launch. If you have opinions about Early Access, please message us with your thoughts! We do know that a lot of you would like to play the game on Steam as well as have access through Humble, so that is a goal of ours regardless. In terms of platforms, our commitment remains the same: PC / OSX / Linux at final launch and iOS / Android / Ouya some time after. For those waiting on the Linux port, we have made some progress, but it is unfortunately still some distance from completion. Some have asked for an estimated release. But since we have definitely not hit our milestones in the past, we are now hesitant to make more promises that we may not be able to keep. But if we were to make some very rough, conservative goals, our hope would be the following: • New builds on Humble by this spring (April/May) • Backer access to the game on Steam this summer • Steam Early Access (Beta) by fall / winter • Release toward end of year, or early next • Mobile builds would therefore come by mid next year We realize that this is not a very promising outlook for many of you, and we apologize again. But we would prefer to be honest and transparent as we progress. So we hope you will be patient as the game matures, though we realize that patience may be in short supply. We will be making every effort to bring you all back into greater involvement with the game through more frequent updates, more media engagement, and more frequent builds… as well as physical rewards. So where are the physical rewards? We have a *lot* of your goodies already packed in mailers and ready to go, and we thought we would be able to send them much sooner. We are literally just lacking one more item design (the manual) to get the first shipment out the door. But since we’ve been tweaking the controls, we didn’t want to print manuals with totally incorrect information. This is consequently at the top of the development tasklist, so as soon as controls are final, we can wrap up the manual and start shipping. Mailing this first set of physical rewards will be a huge morale boost for us, and will also vastly improve our office space (no more dodging boxes)! The second major shipment of physical goods will happen after the final release, since items like the physical boxed copy obviously require the game to be finished. Posters will be shipped separately, and will most likely ship somewhere in between now and release — we will shoot for doing them as soon as possible. But in the meantime, here is another sneak peek of the art print that many of you will be receiving! Is this update over yet? Yeah… it’s kind of long. We should have sent this in about 20 parts over the last several months. Thank you, every one of you, for your support and patience. Without you all, this game would never be happening in the first place, and we are grateful for everyone who has chosen to stick with us. We thank you for caring whether we post an update, and for your reminders that you want to hear from us when we those updates are lacking. The development of Delver’s Drop has definitely not gone as planned or desired, but we continue to work toward our original goal — to make a great game. We’ll be in touch again soon. If you would like to contact us directly, feel free to use our Kickstarter-specific email, <email>. And remember that we have a forum, filled with lots of awesome people who love games at <url>—The Pixelscopic Delvers Hello! We’ve been cranking away on development, and PAX snuck up on us a bit. So apologies for the delay on getting this update out. PAX PRIME Speaking of PAX Prime—we are there! If you are going to be enjoying the PAX craziness this weekend, please stop by and say howdy! We are up on the 6th floor, in booth 6122. We are joined this year with our friends and former colleagues from Graphite Lab who are showing off the latest build of Hive Jump: a multiplayer run and gun that is on Kickstarter as we speak! Come plunder some loot in the Drop, and then scoot over just a bit to blast away at alien hives. A two-for-one kind of awesome deal! Livestreams Make sure to check out some of our livestreams at Twitch.tv/pixelscopic . We do 2 streams—one on Wednesday at 3:00 PM CST and another on Friday at 5:00 PM CST. New Build Coming Soon Speaking of the PAX Prime Build, we are working on getting all of you access to that in the next few days. We’ve also got the ball rolling on getting your Steam keys for the game into the hands of the fine folks at Humble - lots of our backers have let us know they’d appreciate access through Steam so we are making that happen, and soon! What’s new in the latest build? Front end menus, save data, Endless Drop mode is back in, the new (third!) version of the inventory and HUD, new enemies, new weapons, new traps, finalized lighting and shadows, improved particles and emitters, status effects, ammo, and a lot more. Physical Goods Batch 1 Once everyone is back from PAX, we will be making the final preparations to ship out the first batch of physical goods (T-Shirts, Stickers, Buttons, Art Print, and B&amp;W Manual.) The latter two items have taken a bit longer than expected but are almost wrapped up. This is the last call for anyone at the $40 or $60+ tiers that has moved and not notified us to change your address, to make sure you get your stuff, and as fast as possible! If you’ve already emailed us, then you are good to go, but if you need to inform us of a change please contact us: <email> New Build Coming Soon Speaking of the PAX Prime Build, we are working on getting all of you access to that in the next few days. We’ve also got the ball rolling on getting your Steam keys for the game into the hands of the fine folks at Humble - lots of our backers have let us know they’d appreciate access through Steam so we are making that happen, and soon! What’s new in the latest build? Front end menus, save data, Endless Drop mode is back in, the new (third!) version of the inventory and HUD, new enemies, new weapons, new traps, finalized lighting and shadows, improved particles and emitters, status effects, ammo, and a lot more. KS Rewards We’ve mailed out all of the Postcards and the second round for those that contacted us or were returned, so if you backed at the $40 or a $60+ tier and have not received your postcard and have not contacted us, please do so! What about the other physical rewards? They require the game to be finished (or need to be shipped with something that needs the game to be finished) so we are still a ways out from physical goods batch 2 :) Thank you!!! We’re back, backers! Postcards &amp; Rewards As some of you may have discovered in your mailbox, the postcards for all $40 and $60-and-above backers have been sent! We’re hoping everyone has received them already, but PLEASE LET US KNOW if you have not gotten yours by the end of next week — June 13, or maybe a little bit longer for international backers. We want to be sure that everyone’s address is correct before we send the more expensive items (t-shirts, pins, stickers, etc), so make sure you let us know if you think we do not have your current address! Email us with corrections at: <email> The next few waves of rewards will be going out soon! We are busy packing and stamping, folding and taping all of the items into envelopes. In the meantime, here is a sneak peak of the stickers for the $80+ backers: If the animated GIF above worked, then you should see how the stickers look both before and after you peel them from the backing sheet! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ NEW BUILD! At long last, a new build has been posted to Humble! This is a much (much much much) improved version of the demo that we took to PAX East. The one big downside that many will notice right away is that it has a single, not-so-random, pre-designed level. We created this level to showcase some new features, and to create a more cohesive experience while we reworked the randomization systems. So while there is little replayability in this build, you should get a pretty entertaining and fairly polished ten minutes out of it. Expect randomization to be back soon! New Features: ASSASSIN! New opening logo animation! Improved &amp; updated control scheme Zone 2 tileset, and new puzzle objects / blocks New music &amp; sound effects New enemies &amp; traps Smooth turning movement More weapons, ability to use primary and secondary weapons in tandem Damage number pop-ups Lots of other effects and pizzazz, including a dash effect! ”Materials” &amp; elemental vulnerability system - enemies and objects take differing amounts of damage based on the type of weapon / attack you are performing. For instance, wood boxes take much more damage from fire! Probably other things that we’ve forgotten... Let us know what you think on our forums, at <url>’s Drop posters! The folks behind Pop Middle Ages <url>’s cartoons (Ninja Turtles, etc). Here is the first Delver’s Drop Poster for your viewing pleasure... and a second poster in a different style! The Kickstarter campaign for these posters ends on Fri, Jun 13 2014 4:00 PM CDT, so you have about one week to pledge if you’re interested! ***Just so you know, these posters are not the same as the posters included in our Kickstarter rewards! They are by different artists, and can only be gotten through the Pop Middle Ages campaign. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ That’s all for now, so in the meantime, keep Delving! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Hey, friendly backers! We just wanted to let you know that we are preparing a huge pile of physical rewards, and wanted to give you a sneak peek of what’s coming to a mailbox near you within the next 6-8 weeks! IF YOUR ADDRESS HAS CHANGED IN THE LAST YEAR (or will change within the next 2 months), PLEASE SEND US YOUR NEW ADDRESS! — <email> If you already sent us an email to change your address, then you are already updated! No further action is necessary. We will be sending the postcards out first, and then packages of goodies… Here’s what the envelope will look like when it arrives! Pins! We upgraded everyone’s 1” button pins to metallic prints, and instead of 4 pins you will get a full set of all 6 main characters! B&amp;W Manuals! These are NES-style “manuals,” slightly spoof-ish and more for fun than actual instruction on how to play. Just like in the NES era, you’ll have to call our 1-900 phone line if you want to know how to beat that super nasty boss… just joking, check our forums instead :) Art Print! A snazzy-tastic 8x10” print suitable for framing and placing next to your family photos. We're still working on the art for this one, so we’ll send an update with the full image soon! Stickers! Who doesn’t like stickers? T-Shirts! We just printed the t-shirts! They feature a stylized, weathered version of the logo on soft fashionable shirts* in a guy-and-girl-friendly dark navy color. The sleeve will say “Delver’s Drop” in our custom font. Order Extra Shirts! For anyone who is not already receiving a t-shirt as part of their reward package (or if you just want a second shirt), we will be offering a limited quantity at $25 each, shipping included if you’re in the USA. If you would like to order a shirt, please email <email> and tell us your size (XS-3XL in unisex, S-XL in ladies' tees). First come first served! After we confirm we have your size left in stock, we will accept payment by Paypal only. Apologies in advance if we run out, these are very limited! All other physical rewards will be produced later, nearer to when the game is ready for release. This is partly because we need more art which isn’t complete yet, and partly so that we can try to ship similarly sized items together to keep shipping costs on budget. Here’s a teaser of some other stuff in the Pixelscopic “warehouse” (aka closet): a batch of the Little Lazies Rogue figurines! If you have any questions about the other rewards, please email us! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ PAX EAST! We’ll be there at Booth #585 in the Indie Megabooth . If you’ll be in Boston, please come by our booth and say hi! Tell us you’re a Kickstarter backer and do the secret handshake, and you will be dubbed a true Delver. Even more of the expanded team (interns, contractors, etc) will be there this time around, and we would all love to chat with you. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Other Stuff! Updated Logo! Oh yeah, and we updated the logo. Here is a comparison of old and new, just for funzies! One Year Kickstarter Anniversary! Hey, by the way, we just passed the one-year mark since our Kickstarter was successful. Thanks for sticking with us for all this time, through the good (new features!) and bad (delays). We appreciate all of your support, and are incredibly grateful to have had you along for the ride. Next Build? We’ve been crunching the last few weeks to put together a snazzy and sweet demo for PAX East. We will be uploading the next build to Humble after we return from Boston. So those of you who see us at PAX will get a sneak preview, albeit in a very short demo. When we return we’ll quickly revise the demo into a fully fledged build — and we’ll keep you posted on its status and send another update as soon as it’s online. Thanks again for your patience! Next Build’s Upcoming Features: Assassin playable Zones 2 &amp; 3 environments More weapons (and weapon types) More enemies Time allowing, we may also be able to include some forms of elemental damage and some random weapon properties/terms. That’s all for now, so in the meantime, keep Delving! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ *Anyone who ordered 4XL shirts — unfortunately we could not find this size in the same fabric that we wanted to use for the shirts in general, so these will be produced in a similarly colored (navy) cotton shirt. Sorry we couldn’t find a shirt manufacturer that had every size in the poly-blend fabric! Aaaaaaand at long last, the much-anticipated weapons build is finished! Go download version 0.6.2 “Arms Race” from your local Humble Library now! We definitely appreciate all of your patience during the massive gulf of time it took us to get this build out. We have been adding some new systems, and made some pretty extensive technical changes… but more on that later. With several bonus features (you can throw things!!!), we hope the wait will have been worth it. What’s changed? Obviously there are now lots of weapons! To tell the truth, there is really only a small batch of what’s to come in the future, as we add zones and additional content. But the full feature set is in place, and we can make weapons of just about any length, speed, and attack pattern for a huge amount of variety. For a long-winded explanation of the new and changed features, please see the full Build Notes on the forum: <url>’s the short version: Feature Overview LOOT! — Weapons randomly drop from breakable objects and chests. WEAPONS! — New weapon types, with more coming each build. INVENTORY! — Equip up to 6 weapons to your inventory (5 sub-slots and 1 primary slot). ITEM JUGGLING! — Swap your equipped weapon on the fly, for use in your primary slot. CHARGED ATTACKS! — Hold down the attack button to charge the attack for a higher critical hit rate. BARE-FISTED ATTACKS! — No weapon? No problem! Punch your way out. LIFT! — Pick up and carry objects - jars, crates, torches are all portable! Use it as a shield or... THROW IT! — Anything you can pick up becomes a projectile weapon. DEGRADATION! — They can’t all be positive, can they? Weapons and items have decreasing uses, depending on your selected class’s proficiency with that weapon type. Primary weapon types for each class have infinite uses. New Controls The first thing you need to know before you jump in is the new control scheme: The big things to remember are: Use the Interact button to pick up food and weapons, as well as to open the jail doors and flip switches. To use a weapon, you must swap it into your primary slot (on the right side), before it can be used! Weapons uses degrade, so watch the numeric counter on your items. If the counter displays “---” this weapon is infinite use for your class. Weapons System This build took a very veeeeery long time… trust us, we felt the pain as much as all of you. So why all the work and was it worth it? We think so. It would not be an exaggeration to say that Delver’s Drop has one of the more complex weapon systems on the market. Take a look and judge for yourself based on what we can do with the system. In other words, allow us geek out on technical details: VARIABLE SPEED — Weapon speed is a major factor in gameplay — the faster you can strike, the more effective you’ll be. We can customize the speed down to hundredths of a second and weapon speeds can be unique to the three 3 stages of an attack. REPEAT STRIKES — Some weapons can do repeat hits in a single attack, such as a knife stabbing 2 or 3 times in quick succession each time you use it. RANGES — Weapons can have variable lengths / ranges, from the character’s bare fists to the full length of the screen. BARE FISTS — Yes, bare-fisted combat is possible for the masochists among you. Expect achievements for game completion without using a weapon! KNOCKBACK — Enemies are knocked back (and stunned) to greater or lesser degrees based on the weapon type. RECOIL — There is also recoil on your character when some weapons are used. This is undesirable in low-tier weapons, but will cause incredible hijinx when you eventually find a shotgun that shoots you across the room (and possibly across pits) with its recoil burst. USER DAMAGE — Some weapons will hurt you. Yes, this kinda sucks. But if it’s between having no weapon and a low-tier weapon with such a splintered grip that it hurts your hands to use… maybe the weapon is worth it. Or maybe you like the idea of a cursed vampiric weapon that slowly steals your life in exchange for increased damage to enemies. THROWING — If a weapon is unusable, or so poor that you don’t even want to equip it to your inventory, it has a secondary use when you THROW IT IN AN EMEMY’S FACE. It will cause as much damage as before, without the hassle of putting it in your pack. WEAPON COMPONENTS — Each weapon consists of between 4-6 parts that have unique visuals and each part can be swapped via randomization (coming soon!) TONS OF PROPERTIES — There are approximately 100 different scriptable properties that go into determining how each weapons looks and plays. This means that we can create an almost limitless number of unique weapons. The following is the list of weapon features that are NOT yet done, but will be coming in future builds: In the next build, we will add a second button so that you can attack with items directly from your inventory, rather than only your primary slot. Two buttons = DUAL WIELDING! Lots of weapons are not ready yet, but should be available soon — bombs, shuriken, crossbows, grapnels, flails… all ready to go, and just waiting on art and scripting! Weapon randomization (prefix / suffix descriptors) is not yet complete. The weapons randomly drop, but do not yet have randomized properties or names. So expect the “Expert Double-Bladed Flaming Maul of Kablooey” soon. We have plans for around 1,000 base weapon instances (before randomization). Some weapon categories only have one weapon type right now. Eventually all weapon types (axes, maces, firearms, whips, etc) will have at least 10 instances. New Delver Class! And finally, we announce the presence of the new and improved, and most importantly, playable, BEASTKEEPER! The most flamboyant Delver of all is ready to tame the Drop with her powerful whip and (coming later) summoned companion monsters! Bonus Improvements! Vastly Improved Load Times We are now loading approximately TWICE as much data (the weapons databases are gigantic), and load times have been improved so that it should take only 10-20% of your previous wait. For reference, our loading times have been around 5 seconds when you drop to a new level. We would definitely love to hear from you all regarding your load times — it will help us further improve them. Please let us know how the game performs for you here: <url>“Mapping CSV” tab, and download it as a CSV file to replace your local settings. See the “README” tab for more detailed info: <url>#gid=8 We also now have a gamepad tester inside of the game, so if you have a gamepad which we have not yet mapped, you can help us add it! Please help us support every controller possible! Theoretically, anything your computer can recognize as a controller should work — which means things like USB adapters for many console converters should be mappable. We’re still waiting for someone to map a Rockband instrument, Dreamcast fishing controller, or ChaCha Amigo maracas. You can find all of the details about adding a new Gamepad to our database in the public Controller Mapping spreadsheet’s Readme tab as well (same link as above). Build Checker We also implemented a feature to check whether your build is up to date. Whenever the game launches, it will try to ping our servers to see if a newer version of the game is available. If such a version is, then you will get a very basic message telling you that there is a new build and that you should download it. This network check DOES NOT interfere in any way with the normal operation of the game! If you don't have an internet connection, the game simply shrugs and moves on. If your build is out of date, you can still play it to your heart's content the game will simply remind you each time you boot up that a newer version is available. We hope that is a convenient way to guarantee that you are up to date without interfering with your ability to play the game immediately, regardless of internet accessibility. So why’d it take so long? Databases Databases Databasessssssss…. A huge database conversion unfortunately took a massive amount of time and effort on our end. We effectively rewrote the entire code system for our in-game databases. Not only did the coding take forever, we of course broke several dozen things that had to be fixed and tested. So why did we do this if it was so time intensive? Well, we didn't exactly want to, but we were reaching a point of no return. We wrote the database system last summer to work with the massive CSVs our designers and scripters use. Unfortunately, as most of you have probably experienced, the load times for the game were getting really, really bad due to the way this information was loaded. So instead of waiting for the mobile release (for which we knew we would have to redo the databases) and living with awful load times in the meantime, we bit the bullet and redid the whole system. This was one of the most painful months of development for all of us here in the office. We think that the benefits were quite worth it though: now the game is loading approximately 2x as much data (the weapons databases are gigantic) in under 20% of the previous load times. So you get more weapons, levels, and enemies even faster. It was effectively a win-win-quadruple-win, but it was the single largest factor in delaying the build, and giving us all premature gray hair. Or in Coby’s case, further balding. :D Besides that, the weapon system did take longer than expected. But we added some features like thrown objects along the way in order to flesh out the item-equipment system event further. What’s next? Dungeon Generation 2.0 Build v0.6.2 is going to be the last major build using the legacy dungeon generation scheme. In other words, if you like the current rooms in the game, enjoy them now, because everything related to the dungeon is getting a makeover. As we mentioned late last year, the new dungeon generation scheme should accomplish the following goals: More flexibility in room design and greater variability within room components. More cohesive and interesting layout of each dungeon level. Better support for puzzle mechanics both in rooms and throughout a dungeon level. New drop mechanics, less backtracking, and more pronounced progression. Integration with thematic elements We’ve spent a lot of time planning out how to accomplish these goals in order to maximize fun, reduce repetition and backtracking, and create some unique and interesting generations. The shortcomings of the first generation scheme and the planning for this next iteration has given us a lot of confidence that our Randungeoneration™ (Random Dungeon Generation 2.0) is going to be awesome. And if it’s not, we will cry. And then redo it again. Boatloads of Content New content will be raining down from here on out. Random Dungeon Generation 2.0 has been a bottleneck for us regarding adding in the new zones, but now that we are moving forward with the new generation system, new zones will get easier and easier to build. With the weapon system finalized, we are also able to rapidly generate the remaining base weapon instances. New enemies, new objects (puzzle and otherwise), and the remaining characters are also all coming into focus now. The next major build will probably look and feel like a different game! Sneak peak of a basic Zone 2 room: Sneak peak of the updated Assassin Class: Where’s my (insert reward here)? Due to all the database updates and the rush to get content production for additional zones / characters / weapons / etcetera running smoothly, our artists have gotten behind on reward production. We assumed you would still prefer to have cool game updates than a postcard in the mail. But we are beginning to work on them again, and a few are almost ready to print. We’ll send an update as soon as they are in-hand, when we are ready to mail them! Livestreams! Don’t forget that we do a livestream on <url>— one awesome, and one boring. But before we get started, we wanted to wish everyone an amazing holiday season, however you choose to celebrate it! Although we will probably have at least one more update before the new year, this is our best opportunity to say that we hope your holidays are filled with friends, family, food, fun, and obviously lots of time to play videogames. Call-in Livestream We here at Pixelscopic will be having a bit of a holiday get-together this Thursday, and we would like for you to join us via our Livestream from 2pm-4pm CST! We’ve invited all of our local contractors to come by and join in the stream, and we want you to call in! Yes, that’s right! Call us on Skype and ask us questions! It’s like an AMA but with video and audio and things, all broadcast via Twitch. Here’s how it will work: First, tune in to <url>— The Pixelscopic team will do introductions and talk about the current state of the game, and what we are working toward. 2:30-3:00 — Several of our most active forum moderators will call in to ask us questions about the game, and tell us what they think of the recent builds. 3:00-3:50 — every 5 minutes or so we will take a call from one of YOU! Ask us questions about the game, about the team, whatever you want! All you have to do is pick a time slot and call us on Skype at username “pixelscopic”. To sign up for a call slot (and so we know that you’re legit), please add your info to this schedule: <url>#gid=0 3:50-4:00ish — We will take a few last minute rapid-fire calls from anyone who wasn’t able to grab a call slot. This will be a free-for all, so we’ll just take whomever we can. We will also be answering questions on the Twitch chat panel throughout the stream as we can. We’re really excited to try this call-in segment, so please tune in and give us a call! Next Build? So back before Thanksgiving, we mentioned that we would be finishing a new build the following week… but that week has come and gone, and unfortunately the build is still not finished. We’ve been working as hard as ever, so you may be wondering - what’s the hold-up? The most important goal for the upcoming build is to implement at least one example (but probably more) of every single base weapon type, and randomly spawn them for collection and use in the game. This is no simple task; it requires that our weapon skeletons are correctly pulling database info, swapping graphics, and then behaving the way they should… which means that a large quantity of animation files, game code, scripting data, and art all have to be talking to each other. It also means that the entire inventory system, and things like item use count degradation, throwing items out of the inventory, etc. has to be working. In short, this is one of the “motherload” systems that needed to be implemented, and since it touches so many aspects of the game, it was really hard to estimate. So while we are getting very close, it’s still not ready yet. But it will be finished soon, in all of its awesome glory. In the meantime, here’s an animated GIF showing the character cycling through various placeholder weapons - it’s kind of a hack for testing, but isn’t too far off from what you will see in game when it’s finished. With the Thanksgiving break approaching, we thought it might be a good time to whet your holiday appetite with a few snippets of news... First, we’re working on a very cool new build which should be available next week: Weapons Aplenty v0.5.0 Item inventory system Weapon and item system with examples of all 11 weapon families — Swords, Hammers, Flails, Bows, Guns, etc. Note that this will be a slim early version of the full weapon randomization system. Updated and expanded controls and mechanics — pick up and drop items, etc. Revised and improved Shield Dash mechanics Remappable bindings for keyboard and controllers Native cross-platform controller support — including XBox 360, PS3, and PS4 controllers, and more to come. And more! Second, if you’re not already following us on Facebook and Twitter , we would encourage you to do so! We’ve been posting daily-ish updates and bits of Delvers lore. For instance, did you know that in the world of The Drop, a cult of Murk worshippers seek to understand the mysteries of Murk poisoning? Or that Slimes are barely-sentient blobs of spoil bile that seek out and break down any matter they find? If these updates have you asking questions, there’s a whole load of discussions you can participate in on the Pixelscopic Forums ! We answer a lot of questions there, and even bounce ideas back and forth, like what to name one of the world’s races. Don’t forget that we stream at least once a week on our Twitch channel , on Wednesdays at 3pm CST. And finally, for our physical rewards backers at tiers $40, $60, and above, here is a little taste of the postcard that will be coming your way very soon! Have a happy and safe Thanksgiving! Hey everyone! Just wanted to let you know that a new version of the game is up on Humble - it’s Alpha 0.4.2. Change Log: The real jail has been added. Select your character with the Jailer! We added an information splash screen so you can see what build you are playing. Lots of physics/stats tweaking. There are a few new settings options available to tweak (in the settings file): camera mode, lighting mode, and shadows. Information about these can be found in the survivor's guide. Fairly substantial back end work on the collision systems - the game *should*, in theory, perform considerably better than previous version. Forum post about this build: <url>’s a doodle we’re working on for the papercraft Rogue, which many of you will get in the concept art pack when it’s released in a month or so! First of all… Livestream happening NOW! (Thursday 10/10, 4:30 pm CST) <url>… FIXED! Huge apologies about all the confusion earlier today. When we sent the update this morning, the build had indeed been submitted and posted to the Humble Store. However, there was apparently some confusing on our end with updating the access list to include the Beta Backers on the Humble Store. But after a few quick emails, we got it sorted out. (Humble is great to work with by the way!) So in short… go download the game via your Humble Library! And then go patch it! We created a quick patch to solve a few bugs, and improved the character movement properties (which got a little unbalanced right before we sent the builds off). Go here for the relevant Patch details if you already downloaded v0.4.0: <url>… a refresher course if you haven’t claimed the game yet: 1. Go here: <url>“CLAIM THIS PAGE” to add Delver’s Drop to your Humble Library. This will allow you to easily download updated versions as we progress. Now, on to the real purpose of this update: let’s talk about where the game is at, developmentally speaking. ******************************************************************************** A Critical Look + New Developments Through our own play-testing, feedback on our forums, and watching people play the Delver’s Drop at PAX, we’ve come to realize a few things… and have taken a fresh, critical look at where the game is at. Back in August, we talked about being over a month behind in the production schedule, and that we were hopeful to make up some of that lost time. While the game has been getting better day by day, we haven’t really been able to make up nearly as much ground as we would like. So we’re still behind but chugging along — and fortunately since a lot of systems are now in place, progress may speed up slightly in a few areas over the coming months. Schedule After a lot deliberation, we’ve decided to push the entire schedule back to accommodate the design changes we feel are necessary to make Delver’s Drop as good as it should be. Since all of you have early access now, you will be along for the ride, bumpy or smooth as it may be. We realize that delaying the final release may make some of you unhappy, and we apologize. But overall, it seems that most of our backers would prefer for us to take the time to make the best game possible, even if that means there are delays. If you disagree, you are welcome to email us — we *will* respond. So let’s face facts. Based on the issues that we’d like to resolve, and the fact that the features and content are behind, we had to sit down and create a totally new schedule. This includes changes to when features and content will go into the game, when the various versions of the game will be released, and when some physical and digital rewards will be delivered. October–November Existing Feature Polish — We’re going to be putting heavy effort into polishing combat, improving the randomization and level designs, and getting item usage into the game. New Content Schedule — Our plan is to be completing a new zone (with enemies, bosses, etc) approximately every 2-3 weeks starting by mid-November. Physical / Digital Rewards, Wave 1 — including postcards and the digital art pack. December–January 2014 True Beta — Major features will be completed at this point, meaning that the game will be in a more legitimate “Beta” state. We will also publicly announce Open Beta for pre-orders at this time. Physical / Digital Rewards, Wave 2 — We will ship out the smaller swag items, like the pins, stickers, and 8x11” art prints. Spring 2014 Release window for PC / Mac / Linux. Physical / Digital Rewards, Wave 3 — After the game is completed, we will send out the DVD and premium edition boxed copies, along with t-shirts, artbooks, and the remainder of the rewards. Summer 2014 R elease window for iOS, Android, and Ouya. Stretch Goal Features — Local 2-player co-op, local 4-player versus and co-op, and the Labyrinth puzzle mode. ******************************************************************************** Moving Forward While most of the comments we’ve received from players are positive, we think everyone is aware that the game is currently below our personal quality standards, and the level of complexity and nuance we were shooting for. The game is fun, but simple. It is challenging, but maybe not in the right ways. It is randomized, but doesn’t feel uniquely procedurally generated. There are some traps and puzzling interactions, but no fully fleshed out dungeon-exploration puzzle experiences. And there is a large amount of content planned that is way behind schedule. We have started working on several zones, but we have only shown the first one (out of nine). Much of this is simply due to being behind schedule, but some of it needs re-thinking, re-planning, re-estimating, and revision. So what should we do to fix this? This is what we’ve been asking ourselves and working on for the last few weeks, and have a lot of ideas: Fun &amp; Combat Combat has been (and probably still is) somewhat repetitive, without many options beyond hack, hack, hacking away. We have had plans for several different combat mechanics for some time, and are only just now getting them into the game. And from our recent brainstorming sessions, we came up with a few new ideas that we thought would spice up gameplay and offer some more tactical options. A couple of these ideas are present in the current build: we split out Attack and Defend into separate commands, and enabled actual shield blocking. We then fleshed out movement so that when you hold down the Attack button, you move in the slower “Stalking” aiming mode; when holding up the shield, you go into a “Strafing” Defend mode, where your direction is fixed. And finally we added a quick backstep if you tap the Defend button, and a tactical “Shield Dash” if you tap it when running. We plan to do a lot more with these, especially Shield Dash. What if some classes damaged enemies and knocked them across the screen if the dash collides with them? What if others phased straight through enemies and projectiles? We plan to keep working on this and more… Special Abilities anyone? More complex and natural enemy AI? All coming in the future. Randomness &amp; Level Design The intersection of randomization and level design is currently one of the weakest areas of the game. We’ve made hundreds of room variants, each with multiple random aspects, and we’ve spent a considerable amount of time on the generation algorithms. The results are indeed “random” but not in the most effective or noticeable ways. Often times you may have seen a very similar room before, and the rooms themselves feel either oddly empty or overly crowded. There is no strong sense sense of purposeful progress in dungeons, and puzzle elements are far too rare and not fully realized. The level design is incredibly important to the game, and as such, we are planning on putting a lot more effort into getting this right. That begins with evaluating the room design philosophy and generation algorithms at a high level, breaking them down into design “layers,” and coming to conclusions as to why we aren’t currently achieving our goals. We will probably blog and post about this on our forums as we continue to think through and solve these problems. The levels need a stronger hand at the helm (in terms of algorithms) to give them a more defined, yet still loose structure within which randomized layouts can occur. This means creating bottlenecks, intentional backtrack points, loops, etc, as well as important “set piece” rooms where interesting events can occur or treasures can be found. It also means removing pointless dead-ends, and significantly decreasing mandatory backtracking through previously completed rooms. And obviously it means the addition of keys, puzzles, loot, and generally just more interesting exploration. Puzzles, Items, Mystery We are also thinking more about how puzzles should work and interact with the so-far-nonexistent items system. Items like bombs will obviously be fun to use offensively when we get them in (coming soon!), but we want to achieve something much more interesting and nuanced than this. So we’ve been taking a hard look at the pieces we have to work with — in the game systems we already have present, those that are planned, the lore we’ve been working on, and the elemental and magic effects systems we’d like to develop. Basically it’s a gargantuan multi-dimensional matrix of complexity that needs to get boiled down into silly things like “keys” and “puzzle mechanics,” which can generally be used to make a fun dungeon exploration game. The general idea is that every dungeon will have some elemental (or physical / mechanical) ability that is made available by items and room objects, and the way these interact. Our first example of this is the pipes and steam vents that occur in Zone 1. Each zone will add new wrinkles to the system, either adding a new element mechanic or a new set of objects to use those mechanics on. So if you use fire to melt ice in Zone 2, you will then be able to set fire to wooden objects in Zone 3, and scorch plants (which may then grow back after a few seconds) in Zone 4. We want this system to produce a lot of interesting opportunities for unpredictability, and create opportunities for inventively solving puzzles based on the items you happen to have with you as you explore. Bosses? Secrets? NPCs? Story? Yes, all of these are still planned. We won’t bore you with the details and ideas now, but will instead bore you in future updates, or on the forums! :) The above design changes are no small lot and to refactor the necessary systems and implement the new ideas is going to require a pretty serious amount of effort on our part. We are up for that challenge but there are some consequences that must be discussed. ******************************************************************************** It has been a goal of ours to be as transparent and involving in the development process as possible, and we hope that you all feel we have done a good job keeping all of you up to speed on both our progress and frustrations, successes and failures. The most important thing to us has always been (and continues to be) making the best game we are able to make. We are still fully committed to this, and if the feedback we’ve been receiving is any indication, we are on the right track… it’s just a slightly slower track than we had originally estimated. Until next time, catch us on the forums! ******************************************************************************** ******************************************************************************** One last teensy little thing: Kickstarter congrats and suggested campaigns! There are some congratulations in order for Kickstarter campaigns that we’ve been following: Hyper Light Drifter Might No. 9 Shantae: Half-Genie Hero And a few other campaigns you should check out below! Indie Statik — Amazing Indie-game coverage: <url>— By the maker of some awesome 8/16-bit style RPGs (Cthulhu Saves the World, etc.): <url>— A very cool looking Earthbound-ish RPG: <url>— Very pretty game in the vein of Wind Waker: <url>— From the supporters of our most local-ish IGDA: <url>… You now have access to the game, as well as the private forum boards! ***EDIT*** It seems that something is going on with the Beta Backer list, and access may not yet be updated on the Humble Store. We are looking into resolving the problem, and if you don't already have access, you should have it soon. ************ We’ve posted a Survival Guide with information on controls and how to play, in order to help players get up to speed with the game in its current state. You can view/download the guide here: <url>’s new and different in this version, and can be found on the forums here: <url>’s how it works: 1. Go here: <url>“CLAIM THIS PAGE” to add Delver’s Drop to your Humble Library. This will allow you to easily download updated versions as we progress. To register for the forums for the first time: 1. Go to the forums: <url>’re just going to play the current build for a while, talk about the how and why of some of the new additions and answer any questions you all might have. We’re also doing more livestreams in general and you can find our current schedule here: <url>… but we have also taken a step back from this daily grind of development, and been reviewing all of the feedback we’ve received about the game. Between the Alpha backers, our own internal reviews, and the feedback from PAX Prime players, we have had a lot of information and critiques to evaluate. In the next update, we will go into more detail about how we plan to improve the game. But for now suffice it to say that we are working on plans to significantly enhance gameplay and better structure our workflow and schedule. We’ve been expending a lot of thought and effort tackling the design and planning to make it happen, and are nearing the point to begin the refactoring and implementation work required to make Delver’s Drop the best game possible — the game that got all of you (and us) excited in the first place. This evaluation process has taken a decent amount of time, which is the reason for the slight delay on the v0.40 build. We are grateful for the vast amount of feedback we’ve received so far and are excited to unleash the Beta Backers into the Drop, and hear all about their love / hate / intrigue / despair through our forums. Ultimately, producing the best game possible is the most important thing for us, and we think that the next update will shed some light on our current thoughts, and give you a great opportunity to agree, disagree, and share thoughts of your own. ...to be continued soon! Private "Early Access" Forums Since we are still in the Alpha phase and will be for a bit longer (more about that in the next update as well), we’ve altered the structure of the forums a little bit. The private “Alpha” forum has been merged with what would have been the private “Closed Beta” forum to become a combined “Early Access” forum. We’ve gone ahead and flipped the switch and all Backers at $15+ should now have access to this board: <url>“Alpha” but it is indeed available for all Early Access backers.) Feel free to poke around and see what everyone has said about the game so far, and then let us know what you think! There are boards and threads dedicated to bug reporting, general feedback, requests and suggestions… whatever you want to chat about. Most newly registered users should gain access to the private forums within one hour of signing up, but if you can’t seem to gain access to the private forum board, just email us at <email> and we’ll fix it for you. As always, the forums are the best place to leave feedback and contribute to the development of the game. We welcome comments and questions below, but for true in-depth discussions, the forums are the place to be. Thanks again for all of your support! We shall be in touch again soon. Sorry for the slow updates! The last few weeks have been very busy between heavy development, Penny Arcade Expo in Seattle, and… well just keep reading :) Steam Greenlight SUCCESS! Most of you have probably already heard by now, but if not… We were accepted onto Steam Greenlight! When Delver’s Drop is released, all $15+ backers will receive a Steam key! During our epic / exhausting road trip to Seattle in a rental van, we were somewhere in the neverending Montana wilderness (or was it Wyoming?) when we got the email that Delver’s Drop had received the Greenlight from Valve and would be accepted onto Steam. We were floating between number 11 and 14 on Greenlight before the massive batch of accepted games, so we knew that it was just a matter of time. But it was a pretty awesome surprise nonetheless! When Coby told the news to Baker (in a road-weary haze) he said something incredulous, like “Wait, who greenlit us? Greenlit for what? Oh… you mean… *that* Greenlight?” So what exactly does that mean for all of our backers? We will be working with the Valve and the Humble Store folks to get you all Steam keys which will be available from your Humble Store download page. The Steam keys will not be available until the game is released, unless we are allowed to participate in the Early Access program. We will keep you all up to date on how that situation progresses. PAX Prime 2013 We are now back, and (mostly) recovered from the trip to PAX and back again. This was the 3rd time we have exhibited at PAX and this was our biggest participation yet: we had a slightly bigger booth with two stations set up to play the game. As such, we had many more people try out the game this time, and received a lot of very good feedback. Check out the photos at the end of this update! The feedback from watching and listening to people play for 8 hours a day over 4 days straight (combined with your feedback on the forums), has given us a very large frame of reference on the things that need to be changed, polished, added, and axed. We’ve actually started a couple of threads on the forum asking for direct opinions on several aspects of the game, so if you are an Alpha Backer and haven’t seen those threads yet, please give them a read and let us know what you all think! <url>— this link will only work for $25+ Backers, but all $15+ Backers will get access soon! We also started accepting pre-orders for the game; we’ve had many people ask about this over the last few months and have finally made it available although we’ve not officially announced it yet. More info coming soon! The pre-orders will gain access to the Open Beta sometime in October, after backers have had plenty of time with Early Access. New Build - v0.3.8 We’ve just submitted Alpha Build v0.3.8 to the Humble Store, so it should be available by around Monday afternoon. This is technically a minor build update, but since a lot of you haven’t been downloading minor versions from the forums, we decided to send this one out to the Humble Store. It is very important that you UNINSTALL the previous version you have installed before installing this version. There is an issue with the install override that manifests on certain machines and causes very, very strange errors. The detailed build notes for this build can be found on the forums here: <url>’t have a firm release date yet for this version, but the general timeline is within the next two weeks. We will also be giving $15+ backers access to the closed “Early Access” section of the forums (formerly just called “Alpha”). We’ll send out more details when the 0.4.0 release is ready. And finally... PAX PHOTOS! Our booth at PAX, before the show started. Fancy gold tablecloths partially covered in coin-like sequins! Next time we hope to have tables made out of actual gold coins. And the crowds arrive! The two-TV setup was really nice this time around. Judging by how many postcards and buttons disappeared over the course of the show, it was probably our best turnout so far. Team photos! Top Left: Burrell chats with a cool dude and lady. Top Right: Coby tries to will the camera into disintegrating so his picture won't get taken. Bottom Left: Nathan Lee (our composer and general master o' sounds) made the trip up from California to help show off the game! Bottom Right: Weird artsy angled shot of Baker, possibly taken on accident. As always, thank you all very much for hanging with us! As always, feel free to send us an email or stop by the forums and let us know what you think. We would really appreciate your comments on the Alpha at <url>“Rogue Magick” v0.3.2 for Windows and Mac OSX, and it is now available for Alpha Backers through the Humble Store - with 100% more steam pipes! The build is definitely rough around the edges, short on polish, and with bugs aplenty, but it has a decent bit of new content and functionality. It’s also built on the new content pipeline processes we’ve been developing, and will serve as the foundation for (much more easily) adding features, art, enemies, levels, and eventually releasing the final game with excellent performance and stability. PLEASE READ! Right now the game has one zone and two characters, but is lacking inventory, random items, and bosses. There are more build details available on this forum thread: <url>’s Different? RogueMagick v0.3.2 is *considerably* different than the PAX East demo we released to Alpha backers — almost everything has either been updated or done anew to accommodate bigger and better game systems and for much improved performance in the long term. Inventory items present in the PAX build will be coming back to the Alpha very soon. Give Us Feedback! We’ve already received a ton of feedback and bug reports which is awesome. If you’ve got some feedback to share and /or find some ugly bugs, please don’t hesitate to post them in the forums! We read every piece of feedback and have integrated the bugs board into our bug tracking processes, so don’t miss out on your chance to help us improve the game! One More Note: The current builds are now around 30 MB, as opposed to the earlier PAX East build, which was 95 MB. This is normal! Even though we added a lot more content, we optimized our textures and content pipeline like crazy, hence the decrease in file size. Release Schedule Per the original plan, we will now be submitting major builds every 2-3 weeks to the Humble Store. We will also be posting direct patches/hotfixes in the Alpha forums (and later Beta forums). These builds effectively mark our entry into the Alpha phase of development, where features and content will be coming online much more quickly. Very exciting times! Unfortunately, it took us a full 6 weeks longer than expected to get to this point and as a result, we are going to make some changes to the original schedule: Alpha Backer Release: NOW! Beta Backer Release: End of August / Beginning of September Open Beta Period: Begins in October Release: December So while the Alpha has unfortunately been released rather late, we’re going to try to ease the pain on Beta backers. The true “Beta” phase of development (when we’re done with features but still adding some content + polish) won’t begin until closer to October... But in the meantime, we want to let Beta backers in on the fun as soon as the Alpha backers have had plenty of time to enjoy their Kickstarter spoils. And finally, because it’s taken us this long to get a lot of the content pipeline hammered out and the engine up to snuff, the Linux version won’t be coming this month. We are almost to the point where we can begin the actual work on it, but it probably won’t be available until October-ish. We still love you, Linux users! We just can't quite afford to put a ring on it this month. PAX Prime 2013 And finally, we will be returning for this year’s PAX Prime, letting the masses give Delver’s Drop a whirl! (or a stab, or a slash, or whatever). If you will be in Seattle for this year’s show, you should come by and introduce yourself. You may already have the version of the game we will be showing off, but it’s always fun to demonstrate your Delvers prowess to the general public :) We’ll give you more details on our booth location as the expo approaches! Well, crap. There are still some kinks to work out in the Alpha build, so it is not yet submitted to the Humble Store, and we are going to miss the submission deadline to get it published today. We are truly sorry — it’s not been from a lack of effort, but rather poor estimates and unexpected bugs on our end. A lot of things have been going really well, but a few things have taken much longer than expected. We’re actually very close, but that final 10% always takes more effort than you originally expect. In spite of all that, we really want to give our Alpha backers something to play this weekend. So in the meantime, we have submitted the earlier PAX East demo to the Humble Store, and it should be available shortly. Please note that this build is now a few months old, only features Endless Drop mode (no continuous dungeon layouts), and only the Rogue is playable. This is a similar build to the one that you would have seen on YouTube and our previous livestreams. While it is quite out of date, it’s still fun to play around with and get a taste for the game and we hope it will tide you over until we get you something a bit meatier. There are more details about the build available on the forums. On Monday, we will still host our Twitch.tv livestream at 1pm CST, and will show the new build in its current state at that time. Ideally we will also submit it to Humble on Monday, but since we’ve already postponed it twice (sorry again), it’s probably safest to commit to a loose “next week” for the new build to be in your hands. Thank you as always for your patience. We currently accept encouragement and morale boosts in the form of pizza, coffee, and angry shouting. Howdy Backers! (Especially Alpha Backers!) Tomorrow (Friday July 12) we will be submitting our very first Alpha build exclusively for Alpha Backers ($25 and up), called “Rogue Magic v0.3.0”. We’ll probably upload it later in the day as we continue to work on bug fixes. Since this is our first time distributing through the Humble Store, we are unsure of the turn around time from when we submit the build to them and when it is available to download. We will, however, send out another brief message once the build is available. If you keep on the look-out, you might even see it before us. PLATFORMS : Tomorrow’s build is going to be Windows only. We will send the first Mac OSX build on Tuesday (July 16) as we are still working through some technical issues for that platform. Apologies for the inconvenience. LIVESTREAM : On Monday (7/15) we will be having a livestream over on our Twitch channel at 1 pm CST (GMT -6) playing the build and talking about some of the things that are in, the things that aren’t, and what features and content will be going into the next build. <url>’t signed up for the forums yet, you won’t have access to this private board until we run the update script again, which we will probably do each day for the next few days to pick up any late registrations. Please check out this thread on the forums for more details and information about Rogue Magic v0.3.0 as well as other general information. BUILD NOTES Rogue Magic v0.3.0 Current Level of Feature Completion: 30% Current Level of Content Completion: 10% Content Included Rogue &amp; Sorcerer Jail (50%) Zone 1 (80%) Primary Features NOT Included In This Build Randomized Weapon System Experience and Character Leveling Special Character Abilities NPCs / Stores / Narrative Systems Undelvers Front End Menus Boss System Endless Drop Mode Companion Mode 4 Player Modes Humble Store The behinds-the-scene work for getting our Kickstarter and Paypal backers integrated into the Humble Store has been completed. (Many thanks to Shannon and Melinda @ Humble Bundle!) Backers should now be able to retrieve their Delver's Drop download page from the Humble Store and claim it for your Humble Library. To do so, simply use the key resender and enter the "preferred email" you sent to us. Depending on what tier you backed Delver's Drop, you will get one of 3 download pages: $15 tier page, $25 tier page, or the $30+ tiers page. Each page will eventually have the downloads and/or codes that come with your respective tier. Any reward that is not listed on your download page will be fulfilled directly by us to you. If you have any trouble with getting your download page, send us an email via <email> and we will get you sorted. A Big Thank You Without all of your support, Delver's Drop would not be where it is today. We are extremely grateful to be bringing you the best game we possibly can. To proclaim our profound gratitude to the public at large we've put up our backers credits page on the website! Reminder: Robot &lt;3 Kitty Greenlight Supershow Just as a reminder to all our fantastic backers, we've got the Robot &lt;3 Kitty (creators of Legend of Dungeon ) Greenlight Supershow coming up on June 29th. We will be in the 7PM (EST / GMT -5) timeslot. According to them the Supershow was created to "bring the developers and the players together in an unprofessional fun-time BONANZA," and I don't know about you but we love a good fun-time bonanza when one comes our way. So, we hope we see you there on Saturday! First Alpha Build Delay As you all know we were scheduled to release Alpha Build 1 "Rogue Magic" on June 29th after the Supershow. Despite cranking away at all hours of the night, it became obvious this weekend that some core systems would not be ready in time for that delivery date. This is a huge disappointment for us, as we have been excited (and nervous) to get the first version of the game into your hands. We are also aware this is likely a huge disappointment for most of you and we are extremely bummed about the delay. Looking at what we need to finish and how the calendar lines up, we've decided to move the first Alpha build back almost two weeks, to July 12th. This extra time should help us finish the most important aspects for the first build and give us some additional time for some refinement and testing. In general, this moves our entire schedule for the game back 2 weeks, however we are hopeful that we can make up some time between now and release since the largest and most complex systems have already been overhauled. For those of you interested in the more granular details of the development, we've spent a large amount of time refactoring the foundations of the game and adding in support for more advanced tools. You can read about a lot of those details in the TIGSource Devlog. The core combat mechanics have also been greatly enhanced recently as we strive to allow for the most variety possible from weapon permutations, as well as keeping the focus on skill-based gameplay. The large remaining tasks before we can send out the first Alpha build are finishing, testing, and refining the randomization systems (both for the dungeons and for the items/weapons) and finishing all of the new animations for the Rogue and the Sorcerer. Over the next week, we'll post some videos to the forums demonstrating some of these new and awesome features. Thank you very much for you patience and again, apologies for the delay. We are confident that we are on the right path to making Delver's Drop an amazing experience and will continue to work our hardest to get the game into your hands. Distribution We are excited to announce that we have partnered with the Humble Store (from the fine folks who run the Humble Bundle) for direct distribution of Delver’s Drop. What does this mean? Once we have uploaded the Alpha (and later Beta) builds to the Humble Store, we will send a message to the applicable reward tiers with a link that you can use to redeem Delver’s Drop through the Humble Store. The email that you provided in the survey will be the email used to redeem the game through the Humble Store. For those of you who have not filled out the survey, you will have to use the email that we have on file from Kickstarter (or Paypal.) As we make new builds, you can use the Humble Store to download the latest versions, up to the final Release version and beyond. The PC, Mac, Linux, and Android versions, and the OST will all eventually be available for direct download DRM-free via the Humble Store when they are released. You will also get your iOS and Ouya codes via the Humble Store and if/when the game is on Steam, you’ll receive a Steam redemption code as well. We chose to partner with the Humble Store for several important reasons: They are really awesome folks! They were super helpful and very flexible with us, which was a huge help when considering how to distribute Kickstarter reward downloads. Easy and consistent distribution; a better experience than we could otherwise provide on our own. Unified Kickstarter distribution + direct orders (later) = saves us a lot of time that we can spend on the game instead. Ability to provide all of the info / downloads for all platforms in one place. Humble Store Accounts: If you don’t already have a Humble Store account, you can create one here: <url>“preferred email address” that you entered in your survey, otherwise you will not be able to add Delver’s Drop to your Humble Library. Private Forum Access To access the private Alpha/Beta sections of our forums ( <url>“preferred email address” in the survey to be the same that used for your forum account creation. We will be enabling the private forums soon, so if you haven’t filled out your survey please do so ASAP. In other words, your “preferred email address” must be the same for: Your “preferred email” survey response Your Humble Store account email Your Pixelscopic forum account email Apologies for any inconvenience regarding this; when we sent out the surveys we didn't have the direct distributor locked in yet, otherwise we would have mentioned this previously. What if they don’t match? We do have the ability to manually make any changes should something be incorrect, so fret not; just send us an email explaining what needs to change: <email> What about other distribution services? We will be using the Humble Store for fulfilling our Kickstarter distributions and for our direct sales, but we are still pursuing other options for release distribution such as Desura, GOG, Gamer’s Gate, and of course we are still plugging away on Greenlight for Steam. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Robot &lt;3 Kitty Greenlight Supershow We have been invited to participate in a livestream with the great duo over at Robot &lt;3 Kitty, creators of Legend of Dungeon . This will happen on Saturday, June 29th. The event will feature a variety of developers who currently have games on Greenlight. We had the chance to hang out with Calvin and Alix at PAX East a bit and they are a lot of fun, so we are definitely looking forward to the show! We haven’t been assigned a specific time slot yet (the show runs from 11:00 am to 11:59 pm Eastern Time / GMT -5) but once we know, we will post that information. There is another interesting thing about June 29th... --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Alpha Access On Saturday, June 29, right after our segment on the Supershow ends (or perhaps even during) we’ll be posting the first Alpha build for all Alpha Backers ($25+ tier) to download! How will I get it? You will download it on the Humble Store as mentioned above, and then you are ready to rock! How do I play it? On your PC or Mac of course! We will include some brief information about how to play the game and the forums will also have some information that you can check out. As mentioned during the Kickstarter campaign, the first Linux builds will be later (sometime in August), but from that point on the Linux versions will be in lock step with PC / Mac until Release. What is Alpha? Alpha is an industry term that usually means that a game is quite playable but incomplete and unfinished. The June 29th build will be the first Alpha build, so it will be even more incomplete and unfinished than the final Alpha build will be. What will be in this build? The first Alpha build will be highly playable, but contain only a portion of the game’s overall content. You will be able to select between the Rogue or Sorcerer classes and explore (and die in) the 4 levels of the first zone, The Chill. Many features will be present, some will be broken, and others may be missing entirely. I pledged at $30+, so I should get 2 copies of the game. Does this apply to Alpha? No. You will not get 2 copies of the Alpha build, as mentioned on the Kickstarter page. However, you will get 2 copies of all upcoming Beta builds. When we can expect the next build? Or the Beta builds? Below is the tentative build schedule we have set out for major builds, covering up until the first Beta build in early August. In between major builds, we will likely make several minor builds - most often for hot-fixes on particularly bad bugs/errors. We have also come up with code names for these builds (in italics ) so they’re easier to remember and distinguish than with pure version numbers. 06/29/2013 — Alpha: “ Rogue Magic ” 07/12/2013 — Alpha: “ Brute Danger ” 07/26/2013 — Alpha: “ Wild Tale ” 08/09/2013 — Beta: “ Stealth Secret ” Why does the schedule only go to August 9th? The month of August is very crazy this year! Between the first Beta build(s) and PAX Prime, it becomes really difficult to accurately plan so far in advance because PAX is always a bag of surprises. It is our plan to release the 2nd Beta build before PAX Prime but it may not be possible. During August, we will release the remaining build schedule leading up to the final Release in October. How will the demo updates work? The game will try and ping our server when you start it up to see if there is a new build available. If there is, it will show a simple message and then you can download the new version from the Humble Store. Old builds will still work for some time after a new version is released, but eventually we will probably force you to update to the newest version for sanity’s sake. So I have to be connected to the internet to play??? No, of course not :) If you are not connected to the internet - nothing will happen. You won’t get new version notifications, but you can still play the game as you would please. But it’s obviously beneficial to you (and to us) if you’re always playing the newest version. Can I write a preview, upload gameplay to YouTube, or livestream the Alpha Builds? Yes, with a catch or three. We want our users to enjoy the game (and help others enjoy it). This means that you have our permission to show it around in your corner of the internet. But we do have a few requests: Be clear that you are playing an “Early Alpha” build of the game. It is not representative of the final game in terms of features, game mechanics, content, or quality. To help with the above (and to help everyone keep track of which version they are playing), we’ll be putting a “watermark” in the corner of the screen stating something like “Alpha: [Build Name] [Version Number].” This will not obstruct gameplay. We ask that you don’t try to crop or edit this watermark out in any screenshots or videos. Please make the assumption that since this version is not finished, the final quality of the game will (hopefully) be improved — and further assume that your input can help us improve that quality! Feel free to share your early opinions online, but if you want to contribute to improving quality or need to make a complaint or a bug/crash report, we ask that you give us feedback through the forums. These forums allow us to track these issues and feedback much more effectively, and respond directly to critiques. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We need your surveys! If you haven’t turned in your survey responses, please, PLEASE do so! Just look in your Kickstarter inbox for a message about Surveys from Pixelscopic. We have received probably 95% or more of your responses, but that still leaves a lot of you that we haven’t heard from! The sooner we get your information, the easier reward fulfillment will be :) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Custom / Unique Digital Rewards Soon we will be sending out the forms/questionnaires for the more custom digital rewards (such as naming an item/power-up, NPC likeness, enemy design.) So be on the look out for that message! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- One last note: Since we are in the guts of heavy development right now, we are going to hold off on doing the next livestream until after the Alpha build goes out. The Greenlight Supershow at the end of this month should be really awesome though, and we hope you'll join in and enjoy the game with Robot &lt;3 Kitty and us, as well as the other games that they will be streaming. Thanks for doing all of that reading! We know this was a long one, but hopefully we’ve answered (almost) every question that could come up regarding Alpha distribution. If we missed something, hit us up in the comments, on our forums, in a direct message, or at <email>! Here's the moment you've all been waiting for... We've tallied the votes (from Kickstarter and Paypal backers $25 and up) and have the results for the three classes that will appear in the base game (out of 6 choices). Each voter was able to submit 3 votes (which could be the same or different classes). So without further ado... The winners are: 1. Assassin 2. Elementalist 3. Beastkeeper For details on these classes, please see our previous update here: <url>’t responded to the survey yet, just check your messages (see the envelope icon) on Kickstarter. Remember to VOTE! If you are at the $25 tier and up, remember that the voting deadline for the character classes is TOMORROW, May 1. You can submit your surveys later than this, but unfortunately we won’t be able to count your votes toward the 3 classes after the deadline. If you missed the character class list, you can read more in our last update (#21): <url>’re voting for (out of 6 choices) + 1 bonus class added to everyone’s game by our $2000 backer + 1 Kickstarter class for tiers $50+ We’re happy to finally announce the “bonus” class, chosen by our most generous backer, along with the Kickstarter class! If you have any questions about the latter (and how you can get it), more information appears in the last section of this update: <url>’S CHOICE: Musketeer Class Weapon: Firearms - rudimentary guns that fire bullets, shot, and other projectiles. Charge Attack: Mortar Shot - arcs a short distance and causes area-of-effect explosive damage. Special Ability: Blunderblast - Charge up this ability by picking up debris (rocks, wood fragments, even some items or weapons) and then fire them as a massive scattershot. Trained as much in the alchemist's shop as in the marksman's arts, Musketeers are experts in the art of creating explosives. Their guild originally focused on the design and craft of canonry, but the Musketeers have slowly become mere mercenary guards. They pride themselves on their high level of skill with their often imprecise and idiosyncratic weapons. KICKSTARTER CLASS: Harlequin Class Weapon: Contraptions - gadgetry that springs forward to hit enemies with a huge variety of attachments. Charge Attack: Ricochet - fires the contraption’s attachment which bounces from one enemy to the next before returning. Special Ability: Mirage - creates one or more magical mirages of the Harlequin which cause effects (explosions? ice? poison?) on contact. Performers and jokesters with a penchant for trickery, Harlequins are mysterious figures that hide behind masques and vivid clothing. Skilled in the use of hidden gags (and weapons), they deal in misdirection, magical illusions, sometimes even poison and other devious skills. A Harlequins' only form of speech is laughter — they communicate with others through pantomime. And remember that this class will have multiple bonus costumes for backers $50 and above! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Livestream – now on Twitch.tv! As promised, we’ll be doing at least one livestream a month, and these will now occur on Twitch at <url>’re happy to be a part of the Twitch community, and hope that you enjoy seeing our bearded faces there every 30 days or so. Our next livestream will be on Thursday, May 9 @ 2PM CDT (GMT -5) . Most importantly, we'll be discussing the classes that won the vote. But we’ll also show a bit about how our toolchain works, how we design rooms, and the awesomeness of Texture Packer. And as always we'll be taking questions about the gameplay, modding, etc. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Forums - chat with us! <url>’ve been incredibly happy with our forum participation so far! With almost 1,000 registered members and over 3,000 posts, our little community is turning into a not-so little (and not so quiet) venue for discussing everything from Delver’s Drop mechanics to literature. Thank you to everyone who has helped to make it such a vibrant community. For those of you who haven’t checked it out yet, it’s only fair to let you know that we often leak bits of information like old concept art, details about our scrapped game ideas, and even bug videos for Delver’s Drop. So if you want the entire scoop, come chat with us! Thanks for reading, and we’ll be in touch again soon! Greetings friends! It’s been a few since we’ve posted an update because we’ve been busy prepping some exciting new stuff. Without further adieu let’s dive right in... Forums We’re excited to announcement that the Pixelscopic / Delver’s Drop forums are now open to the public! You can register at: <url>’re rather barren at the moment; consider them fertile grounds for you to grow a garden of conversation. We’ll be posting more there soon and will be using it as the primary method for interacting with the community going forward. We’re really looking forward to chatting with you all in more depth as we make the journey to launch together. On another note, we’ve received several pieces of fan art that would be great to post in the forums. If you have submitted fan art to us before, please register for the forums and re-post them on the Fan Art board — we’d do it ourselves, but we want you to get the credit for it :) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Surveys Very soon every backer will be getting a survey for info related to your reward(s). This may include everything from the name you want listed in the credits, to your preferred email address, to shipping address. IMPORTANT: The email address you provide in the survey about reward info will need to match the email address you use to register on the forums. This is so that we can properly grant Alpha/Beta access, and their exclusive forum area(s). Due to Kickstarter's process we can only send one survey per tier so we’re going to have to collect all information up front, even though it will still be some time before we send physical rewards out. Keep in touch through <email> if you need to change any information after the fact! There are a few questions at higher tiers that we will ask via email — specifically if you are featured in the game as an NPC or are submitting other in-game content ideas. But anyway (and most importantly), the moment we've all been waiting for... ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Classes We’re excited to announce the six classes we’ve sketched out for backers to vote on for inclusion into the game! (You can vote if you're at the $25 tier or above). We’ve listed below our current concepts regarding each class’s backstory, weapon, and general mechanics. But these are subject to change based on further development, testing, and Alpha/Beta player feedback. Out of these 6 proposed classes, you will be able to vote for 3 in the backer survey, and we’ll take the top 3 classes for inclusion in the game! Everyone gets these classes in their game at launch. So the characters in total are: 3 base classes (Rogue, Sorcerer, Gladiator) + 3 extra classes you’re voting for (out of 6 choices) + 1 bonus class added to everyone’s game by our $2000 backer + 1 Kickstarter “exclusive” class (remember it’s share-able!) for some tiers = 8 total classes We’ll be announcing those last 2 classes in our next update, along with the results of your vote for the 3 extra classes! So what happens to any classes that don’t get voted into the game? And why only do 3 out of the 6 ideas we have? Well each class takes a LOT of time to develop — doing the art for all 8 facing directions, plus animation, plus weapons and effects... and then doing the programming / scripting / balancing to make the class work in the game. There is a chance we could someday add the other class ideas in an update or expansion to the game if there is enough interest and support after the game is released. Or we might even add other classes too, who knows! Remember, you’ll get 3 votes in the survey we send out — and yes, you can use all three to vote for the same class if you really, really, really want to make sure it gets added. A few quick notes on the general mechanics involved in classes: Each class has a preferred weapon type which can be equipped for permanent use. Classes can use weapons other than their preferred type, but only for a limited number of attacks. A class’s Charge Attack results after holding down the attack button for a specified amount of time and then releasing. A class’s Special Ability is charged over time through various unique mechanics — these are currently TBD for all classes, but examples may include collecting gold, killing enemies, running at top speed, etc. The ability itself is activated by a separate button when the meter is charged. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bard Class Weapon: Instruments (shoot musical sound waves) Charge Attack: Randomized Multishot Special Ability: Random effects on all enemies in room (debuffs, confusion, stuns, etc.) Usually cheery in demeanor, Bards live for performance and praise. They have a reputation of manipulating others with the magic of their music — causing joy and despair, love and fear, or even confusion to get what they want. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Templar Class Weapon: Spears Charge Attack: Dash Attack Special Ability: Temporary Invulnerability + Regeneration A once-noble order of guardians, Templars have all but forgotten what they were once tasked to defend. Honorable yet desperate and lonely, they've taken to menial jobs and mercenary work to scrape by. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Beastkeeper Class Weapon: Whips Charge Attack: Intimidating Lash (knocks enemies back and keeps them at a distance) Special Attack: Summon Stampede Beastkeepers possess a heightened attunement to animal life and have a healthy respect for the power of natural creatures. They have been known to tame beast companions through little-understood inherited magic, and have enhanced abilities to summon mystical companion pets. (Think 2-player Companion Mode!) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Huntsman Class Weapon: Bows Charge Attack: Rapid Fire / Spread Shot Special Attack: Place Traps (immobilize and damage enemies) Huntsmen are stoic, precise, and master tacticians and trackers. Living for the thrill of the hunt, these stalkers care more about the fur and meat of their quarry than admiring any sort of beauty or power of the prey they kill. Rely on setting the field to their advantage before a battle. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Assassin Class Weapon: Dual Blades Charge Attack: Spin attack with thrown projectiles Special Ability: Invisibility + Speed Boost Consummate professionals, Assassins are trained killers with a loyalty tied only to their contract. Despite their grim trade, Assassins are largely amoral and view killing as their job — one that demands their skills be honed to deadly sharpness. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Elementalist Class Weapon: Staves (mid-range elemental magic) Charge Attack: Area of effect blast Special Attack: Wildfire (randomly snaking elemental streams) Elementalists are blessed (or cursed) with the ability to draw out and direct the raw power of their surroundings. Often treated as dangerous outcasts because their abilities can manifest randomly, they are spurned by most towns, thrown in prison, or simply killed... but those in power respect and rely on their skills. They tend to live in the wilderness for obvious reasons. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Planned Future Updates We’re developing a tentative schedule for updates in various locations to keep in contact with everyone as development on Delver’s Drop progresses. Below is a list of updates and outlets that we plan to use in the coming weeks and months: Weekly devlog on TIGSource Bi-weekly (once every two weeks) Kickstarter and blog post updates Monthly livestream Q&amp;As near the end of the month Monthly newsletter updates ( sign up here! ) And as always we love chatting on Twitter and Facebook ! That’s it for now! Surveys requesting info about your specific reward tier (and notably asking for your class votes) will be going out in the next week or so. Let us know if you have questions through the comments below, or by emailing <email>... but we also hope to hear from you on our forums! PayPal Extension Ended Last night, we ended the PayPal expansion of our campaign. Here is the final breakdown of the numbers: Kickstarter Pledges: $150,745 Kickstarter Backers: 4,534 PayPal Pledges: $5,051 PayPal Backers: 149 TOTAL PLEDGES: $155,796 TOTAL BACKERS: 4,683 Thanks to all of you once again for the tremendous amount of support. This is the first update where all of the PayPal backers have been looped in, so a hearty welcome! Now it’s time to dig into the details and get things moving forward! ========================================================= PAX East Conquered As you all probably know, we exhibited Delver’s Drop at PAX East this past weekend in Boston. This was the second PAX we were fortunate enough to exhibit in and the fourth time we’ve publicly demoed the game. The booth was busy virtually the entire time, and unlike PAX Prime, there was rarely a moment that the game wasn’t being played. It was great to meet many of you and all the other folks who stopped by! All set up before Day 1, taking a short break before the insanity begins. A taste of the physical item swag some of you will get with your pledge (only bigger and better for backers!), or you can grab some if you visit us this fall at PAX Prime. Visitors on Day 2. A shot of the Indie Megabooth (see the sign on the left). Look at those crowds! You might be interested to know that we had a visit by Jerry Holkins (aka Tycho, the writer of Penny Arcade). He came by at the end of day 2, and seemed to enjoy his few minutes of play time before he ran off to a panel. It was really fun to meet him, and to know that he’d heard of the game. We also had a record holder for PAX who survived 23 rooms of Endless Drop mode! You can see a group photo of us with him (in the glasses.) We also had a Kickstarter backer get to Room 21, falling just short of having the weekend's best run. Delver’s Drop was also one of 13 games to be selected for Warp Zoned PAXpocolypse Best of 2013 award! Here is the full list. ========================================================= Development Details via Destructoid Just prior to leaving for PAX, we had the opportunity to chat with Jason Cabral of Destructoid. Over the course of a couple of hours we discussed the early ideas of Delver’s Drop, its evolution to the current form, how the art style was conceived, and many other details. If you are interested in learning more about the game from its earliest stages you should give the following articles a read. There is also a lot of artwork that has never previously been released to the public. Part 1 — Delver’s Drop Began as a Mash-up of Zelda and Pinball Part 2 — High Definition and Sexy: Pixelscopic on Choosing 2D ========================================================= The Road Ahead In the next couple of weeks we will be sending out surveys to all backers who purchased any physical goods to get their preferred mailing addresses, T-Shirt sizes, etc. We’re also working on finishing up the initial art for all of the character classes so the voting process can begin. Be on the lookout for those emails! Since we’ve returned from PAX, Ryan Burrell has been working diligently to get our new forums up and running. The forums will be a great place to discuss the game, look up FAQs, chat with other enthusiastic delvers, and will also serve as our central location for issue tracking once we begin releasing the Alphas and Betas this Summer. Our goal is to have the forums up and running smoothly by the end of next week. We’ve all finally recovered from various forms of PAX Plague and are diving back into the development of the game with renewed vigor, and renewed inspiration. The next few weeks will see lots of internal improvements and standardization of data elements as we finalize systems, implement missing features, add new tools to the pipeline, and move toward the heaps of content generation in front of us. To keep you in the loop as we go along, we’d like some feedback: How often would you like us to post updates here on Kickstarter? Weekly? Bi-weekly? Monthly? These will usually contain some details about development, but also our progress on the schedule and reward fulfillment. We’ll post additional details to our own blog. We’d like to share concept art, videos, and other visual pretties with you as we go. Do you prefer those to be posted on our Pixelscopic blog, encapsulated within Kickstarter updates, or posted in our forums? We’ve been tossing around the idea of doing a livestream each month; is there substantial interest in that or would they lose their magical luster if we did them that often? Or maybe that isn’t often enough? Please let us know what comments, concerns, and questions you may have! We want to do our best to keep the development of Delver’s Drop engaging and exciting for all of you. Thanks once again and ciao for now! ========================================================= Heyo Delvers! Wanted to shoot you a quick update on a couple nifty things: ========================================================= Greenlight Yargh! Delver’s Drop be on Greenlight ! We’ve been climbing steadily through the ranks, but we need your help to crack the ceiling! If you haven’t yet, please up-vote Delver’s Drop on its Greenlight page . There’s also a button to share the game via your Steam status or various other social media; Greenlight is the next big hurdle and we really appreciate you getting the word out! ========================================================= Story War A cool Delver’s Drop reference has recently been incorporated into the up-and-coming party card game Story War ( you can view it’s Kickstarter here ). Story War is a battle game where you make up stories about the cards in play to gain the upper hand against your friends and foes. The uber-cool thing about it is that the Story War team wanted to incorporate a Delver’s Drop card into the mix, and we were tickled that they wanted to do so. BEHOLD: Super extra awesome news: Delver’s Drop backers who also backed Story War at the $10 level or above get this card included in the PRINT-AND-PLAY package. Story War backers at $60 or above get the Rogue card in their physical set regardless of having backed Delver's Drop . So... neat! Delver’s Drop has its first cameo! ========================================================= Indie MEGABOOTH We also wanted to give a quick shout-out / reminder about the Indie MEGABOOTH that we’re a part of at the upcoming PAX East expo! For those of you who don’t know, the Indie MEGABOOTH is a pretty awesome mini-expo inside of PAX itself, taking up 5,400 square feet of show space packed with 50 developers and 62+ games. We’re located in the lofty Booth #886. There are some pretty cool games in the lineup for East, including a couple who are currently running Kickstarter campaigns: Lords of New York An adventure RPG game where you follow the story of one of three high stakes poker players as they pursue their life's ambitions and become one of New York's elite. Each character has unique gameplay, end goals and poker style (cheating, intuition or statistics) all designed to support a compelling story arc. While the paths of their stories may cross, they are completely different, increasing the game's replayability. Visit them on: Kickstarter , Website , Facebook , Twitter Telepath Tactics A turn-based tactical RPG with a goodly amount of customization available for the player. Destructible/constructible environments, a map and dialog editor, and 2-6 person local multiplayer round it out for a good time at parties. Visit them on: Kickstarter , Website , Facebook , Twitter Check ‘em out, and we hope to see you at PAX! PAX East 2013! As if the last month’s mad dash through Kickstarter and getting to know you all wasn’t enough, now we’re going to show up at PAX East and get a chance to talk to the bazillion people there as well! Additionally, we’re proud to be returning as part of the Indie MEGABOOTH which has now grown to a whopping 50 developers and over 60 games. Stop by and check us out, pick up a little swag, play the early Endless Drop demo , and generally chit-the-chat. We’re in Booth #886, which is conveniently marked on the expo hall map below ( Click for large version ): --------------------------------------------------------------------- PayPal &amp; Stretch Goals As we previously noted, we’ve opened up a PayPal contribution page for those who weren’t able to participate in the normal Kickstarter - typically because they are outside the United States and/or don’t have a credit card that Amazon will accept. We didn’t want to exclude anyone based on a logistical technicality and consider this a short extension to the Kickstarter campaign. Any funds we receive through PayPal will count toward the main campaign’s Stretch Goals. We’ve received $1,040 via the PayPal page to date, bringing our current campaign total to $151,785. Kickstarter doesn’t allow us to update the main project page after a campaign ends, but we’ll keep you updated on the total if/when it grows. As a reminder, we’re shutting down this grace period on March 27th . We’ll also be providing updated versions of our handy stretch goals graphic: --------------------------------------------------------------------- Spreading the Love We would be horribly remiss if we didn’t share info about some other Kickstarter projects near-and-dear to our hearts that are coming up on their final deadlines: Cryamore &amp; Days of Dawn These two projects and their dedicated crews were kind enough to recommend Delver’s Drop to their backers, and we’d like to return the favor. Though their Kickstarters have ended, but sure to follow their updates and various media sources. RPGs FTW! Cryamore: Visit them on: Kickstarter , Website , Facebook , Twitter Days of Dawn: Visit them on: Kickstarter , Website , Facebook , Twitter Whispering Willows Ending soon - like, in the next 5 hours! A 2D horror puzzle game where you play as the lone Elena searching for her father. It incorporates some interesting gameplay mechanics like astral projection as you explore the haunted Willows estate. Visit them on: Kickstarter , Website , Facebook , Twitter Back to Bed A 3D puzzler set in a gorgeous surrealist style. You play the role of a sleepwalker’s subconscious mind, manipulating the environment to guide your hapless physical self out of harm’s way. Visit them on: Kickstarter , Website Telepath Tactics A turn-based tactical RPG with a goodly amount of customization available for the player. Destructible/constructible environments, a map and dialog editor, and 2-6 person local multiplayer round it out for a good time at parties. Visit them on: Kickstarter , Website , Facebook , Twitter Spine Another Kickstarter that has already ended, but we wanted to give a shoutout to this fantastic little product - a 2D skeletal animation tool. We’re incorporating it into our tool workflow for Delver’s Drop, and it’s going to save us a ton of time and headaches. Visit them on: Kickstarter , Website , Google Plus , Twitter ============================================= That’s all for now! Stay tuned for more updates as we make our pilgrimage to PAX East! Yes, SUCCESS. That's really all we have to say. We are thrilled, amazed, exhausted, excited... pretty much every emotional and physical state of being all at once. But mostly ecstatic. The Kickstarter ended at over 200% of its goal, totaling $150,745 from 4,534 backers! And of course we also unlocked the $150k Stretch Goal for the 100-Room Puzzle Labyrinth! That's just insane. We originally only asked for $75,000 and thought we would top out at 2,500 or hopefully 3,000 backers. But 200% of the goal? Over 4,500 people? If you had told us that a few weeks ago, we would have offered you a straight jacket. But really we were crazy to doubt how amazing the Kickstarter community could be. Thank you, again. We cannot say that enough. You all have exceded our every expectation, hope, and cautious dream with your generosity, encouragement, and enthusiasm for Delver's Drop. So what now? Well we're all exhausted and hungry after doing a 4-hour livestream tonight. Thanks to everyone who came out to celebrate with us! Now the real work begins. We'll have a brief hiatus as we prepare and then travel out to PAX East next week. But then we're back to Springfield, and back to development. We're going to do a big reassessment of what we'll be able to do with your generous pledges, and then update our plans to take into account this massive success of a campaign. And then last but obviously not least (in fact, most importantly), we'll get back to work on Delver's Drop! We have a lot to do and are even more excited to have you with us on this wild ride that is game development. This is definitely not the last update. We plan to keep you in the loop on our progress every few weeks. We will also continue answering questions here on Kickstarter through the comments and direct messages. So stick around — we'll have lots of cool things to share! And with that, we're out. We need a good night's sleep, and judging from the livestream comments, some of you do as well. No amount of thank you's will ever be enough, so for the last time in this message (but certainly not the last time we will ever say it): THANK YOU. — The Pixelscopic Team Welcome backers, friends, and fellow Delvers to our final update before the end of campaign. After 32 days on Kickstarter, we now have over 4,000 backers (seriously there are 4 THOUSAND of you!), we’ve blazed past $130,000, met four stretch goals... and it’s been an amazing run. Thank you again for being with us on this journey to launch Delver’s Drop into reality. The team here at Pixelscopic (and our patient families and significant others) thank you from the bottom of our heart meters. So let’s close this campaign out right! You probably already know, but: The campaign ends at MIDNIGHT TONIGHT! (U.S. CENTRAL TIME) *****That’s Tuesday March 12, 11:59pm CST (GMT-6)***** So finalize your pledges and hold onto your adventuring boots, because we have a few things planned, and a few more things to go over before it's... well... over. ---------------------------------------------------------------- Paypal Pledges Our Paypal contributions page is now live! <url>’re launching it a bit later than originally promised. We’re actually extending its duration through Wednesday, March 27, so you have just over 2 weeks to contribute this way. But after that, we will not offer the amazing multi-platform bundles or participation in many other rewards (such as voting on characters or access to the Closed Alpha and Beta). More good news: Any Paypal contributions also count toward our Stretch Goals! We will continue to update the Kickstarter page (and our website) to track progress. A huge special thank you to anyone who went to the trouble of getting a pre-paid card or found other means of contributing to Kickstarter. We couldn’t have done it without you, and hope you’ll forgive us for not having the Paypal option worked out sooner. Note: You cannot increase your Kickstarter pledge via our Paypal page, or change your Kickstarter pledges in any way after the campaign has ended. They are mutually exclusive in that sense. Please do not request to add to your pledge! ---------------------------------------------------------------- Closing Livestream We’ll be doing another Livestream from 8pm to midnight (CST) tomorrow night, to close out the campaign and have some fun. <url>’s talk about our favorite gaming memories, what we’re excited about in the gaming landscape, our inspirations for Delver’s Drop, and maybe even what we’re looking forward to at PAX East. If you have any questions about the campaign, please ask them now in the comments or a direct message! During the livestream we want to focus on what’s fun about gaming, which is the reason we’re all here. While we’ll answer some questions about the game, we’re definitely hoping for more of a casual affair — more of a celebration than a strict Q&amp;A. You can of course always ask us further questions here on Kickstarter, even after the campaign is over. ---------------------------------------------------------------- Newest Stretch Goals Over the last few days, we’ve reached the extremely popular multiplayer stretch goals for local 4-Player Co-op Horde Mode, local 4-Player Competitive Deatchmatch, and local 2-Player Co-op “Companion” Mode (just reached today)! Thank you for all of the support that has gotten us this far. We’re incredibly excited to add these features to Delver’s Drop! ---------------------------------------------------------------- PAX East Remember that we will be at booth #886! Come see us and get some Delver’s Drop pins... and more importantly, play the game in person! We’ll send you a show floor map right before PAX so you’ll know exactly how to find us. ---------------------------------------------------------------- Notice about Exclusive Content There has been a lot of discussion both on and off Kickstarter about the fact that we are offering exclusive items and especially an exclusive class to backers at various tiers. On the one hand, our backers seem to be very excited about these bonuses. On the other, many are opposed to the idea of any content that is exclusive to a certain group, especially when exclusivity is based on their place of purchase. This is of course an issue in the wider industry as well, and one that we find our campaign in the middle of. Honestly, our intention in providing exclusive content was to give an amazing bonus to backers in return for their generosity. These backers were truly funding the development of the exclusive content by giving more than the minimum. But this inadvertently causes us to exclude many others from this content, which was not our goal. Once we created the reward tiers and had any backers pledge to them, these tiers and their contents cannot be altered (Kickstarter regulations). And we are committed to honor our promise to backers that they will receive exclusive content through these tiers. But simultaneously, we are saddened that we’ve created a situation that has divided our user base and fans. We want to find a compromise and have been talking to many people here on Kickstarter about possible ideas. We are now prepared to announce a plan to rectify the situation, though we don’t have every detail in place yet, and it will take more thought and additional development to flesh out this plan: 1. Backers who pledge through our Paypal page get access to the same content as Kickstarter backers, for the same price. This allows anyone who can’t back through Kickstarter to get the same deal for a limited time. 2. On day one of the game's release, all backers at tiers $15 and up will receive the Exclusive Items that go with their tiers, and backers at $50 and up will receive the Exclusive Class. This honors our commitment on Kickstarter (and Paypal). 3. As an added bonus, the Exclusive Class will be the only one that has multiple (selectable) character "skins," aka different costumes. 4. Approximately 3-6 months after release, we will develop a system that allows backers who have exclusive content to share these items with others. The exact method of sharing (and frequency one can share) is still being determined, as we have not begun development. Sharing will not occur at all until this system is in place (think of it as a timed exclusive if you like). 5. The basic idea is that an Exclusive Backer can send a “blueprint” or "treasure map" to a non-exclusive backer, and they can then use this blueprint to craft the Exclusive Items or find (through a number of secret steps) the Exclusive Class, and unlock these in their game. Think of the backers as the “Secret Santa” of our game world, sending unlock codes to friends... but these friends have to work a bit to actually unlock the content. 6. BUT — Non-exclusive backers receiving these blueprints and unlocking the content will get cosmetically different versions. 1) The Exclusive Class will be limited to only one skin for non-exclusive backers. 2) The Exclusive Items will look less luminescent, and will create fewer particle effects when used. Basically the exclusive versions are flashier. Our hope is that the Exclusive Backers see their ability to share content with the rest of the community as an added perk to their rewards. And simultaneously, we hope that non-exclusive backers will be pleased with the idea that the exclusive content will (over time) spread throughout the community — though with cosmetic differences. And finally, we believe that to the best of our ability this fulfills our obligations listed on the Kickstarter page that the Exclusive Class “is only available through Kickstarter” since it is truly being distributed through Kickstarter’s process, and by its backers. We hope that you will agree that this is a satisfactory compromise, and apologize (again) if you do not share this opinion. We realize this is a situation where we can’t please everyone... so we are trying to do the best we can at being honest, transparent, and accommodating to the vast majority of our users. Please send us a direct message to discuss further if this seems unsatisfactory to you. Thank you to all of the backers who offered suggestions and feedback — you played a crucial part in finding this solution, and you have our sincere gratitude. ---------------------------------------------------------------- Well that ended on a complicated note, huh? We hope that you’re still with us, and are ready to close this campaign out in the most awesome way possible. Don’t forget to check out the livestream tomorrow night to countdown the campaign with us! Or if you've been holding out, please back us now while you still have time! — The Pixelscopic Team Since we have a lot of new backers, and the campaign only has a few more days remaining, we thought it would be a good time to clarify what rewards everyone is getting. So here’s the deal: We ADDED some cool stuff to all of the tiers throughout the campaign, and are ADDING MORE right now! But we can’t change the wording in the rewards list sidebar (Kickstareter regulations!), so it’s hard to catch all of those details if you’re new. So in summary: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- YOU MAY BE GETTING COOL REWARDS YOU DON’T KNOW ABOUT! ------------------------------------ AND --------------------------------------------- YOU MAY WANT TO UPDATE YOUR PLEDGE TO GET MORE COOL LOOT! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Scroll to the bottom and check out our new handy rewards chart, to make sure you know exactly what you're getting!

So please make your final selections as we move into these last few days of the campaign. -------------------------------------------------------------------- The items below have been ADDED to your reward tiers during the campaign, plus a few BRAND NEW items added today!

That’s why we make pictures and charts and things! Check out this image for a 100% accurate graphing of EXACTLY what you are getting at your tier. CLICK TO VIEW ZOOMED-IN VERSION HERE! -------------------------------------------------------------------- FINAL NOTES If you are changing your backer amount, please make sure you also update your reward selection! This can be confusing, and it’s easy to add more dollars to your pledge while accidentally selecting a lower tier. So double check your reward and make sure it matches if you’ve updated your amount at any time! That’s it! We hope we’ve run a really great campaign. Not that there haven’t been a few minor mistakes or miscommunications, but we pride ourselves on trying to be as clear, fair, honest, and transparent as possible. If you have any further questions or if we messed anything up in the rewards chart, please drop your comments below! Hey, everyone! While we were busy celebrating the Kickstarter's completion and forgetting to post more updates, you all went and boosted the campaign from the $75,000 goal all the way up to $100,000 in the last 3 days. What?! That's amazing. And a huge warm WELCOME to all of our new backers! So let's talk about those Stretch Goals, huh? We've already unlocked the Linux Goal at $85,000 and the first expansion at $100,000. To keep better track of how the campaign is doing, we added a fancy progress chart on the front page. Just scroll down a little bit to see how we're doing, and read more info on each goal. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Linux — $85,000 - ACHIEVED! - We are now adding day-one Linux support when the game releases for desktops in October 2013. (Originally, the Linux release date was TBD 2014). Basically, this Stretch Goal allows us to bring in some additional programming support to help us work on porting our engine. Way quicker than having our one programmer work on the game and do the Linux port, huh? We're really glad that this one was reached, because we are truly committed to supporting as many platforms as possible, as soon as possible. So thank you for pledging us up to this tier, and congrats to all of our Linux users! Content Expansion #1 — $100,000 - ACHIEVED! - We will expand the game with an additional character and another zone (with unique enemies, boss, etc). We originally had this zone in our design documents, but cut it to keep the game on a more reasonable budget. So with this achieved, you now get our "original vision" for the game, complete with all of this content in the base game. This will very likely be available on day one of release, integrated directly into the game and story. The content will be added to the game for everyone that purchases it — no separate download or purchase for anyone! This means that our Kickstarter backers are directly adding to the game, making it a richer experience for everyone. Thank you! 4-Player Expansion — $115,000 - NEXT GOAL - If we're able to reach this stretch goal, we will add local 4-player modes to the desktop versions of the game. There are two modes: Deathmatch and Horde Mode. Deathmatch will be an awesome competitive mode, where up to 4 players can duel it out in custom-designed arenas, while trying to avoid traps and grab randomly dropped power-ups. Our goal: Super Smash Bros. meets Zelda: Four Swords! We want this to be an amazing party game for you and your friends. Horde is a cooperative mode where a group of players battle waves of spawning enemies. The goal is to survive as long as you can, and the game will track progress like number of waves and number of kills per person. This will be our ultimate high-score arcade mode! ------------------------------------------------------------------- So what can you do to help us hit the next goal? Besides giving us more money, that is ;) PROMOTE THESE GOALS! We will really need some additional promotion to get to the further stretch goals, including the 4-player modes at $115k. At this point, we've contacted about as much press as we can. So since we're crowd-sourcing the funding of the game, why not crowd-source its promotion too? Here are some easy things you can do! 1. SHARE any articles and YouTube videos about Delver's Drop with your friends. Most articles will have a share or like button so you can post it to Facebook or Twitter. Try sharing these articles: <url>"Support Delver's Drop" post may not help. Find something specific and interesting to talk about — things you are excited about, a specific unique mechanic, a character class, part of the story that you find interesting... anything that can "hook" people and get them interested! Look through our updates for ideas if you haven't already. 3. POST UNIQUE INFORMATION about us on forums or targeted social media. Focus on any forums that are about RPGs, indie games, old-school style games, roguelikes, etc. Especially as we approach each stretch goal, it would be great to get a new community excited about something like the 4-Player Deathmatch Mode. 4. Best way to Tweet / Share: Whenever you share information on a social media forum like Facebook or Twitter, make sure you link back to our official account and to the Kickstarter campaign. For example, make sure you use @DelversDrop on Twitter, and if you do the same thing on Facebook it should auto-complete a link to our page. This helps people find information immediately. Here are some examples: Facebook: New Action RPG game @Delver's Drop is getting close to its 4-Player Deathmatch goal on Kickstarter. It's like Super Smash Bros. meets Zelda! Help by backing it, and you'll get the game on 6 platforms for the price of one! <url>#Kickstarter goal. It's Super Smash Bros. meets Zelda! <url>— more than just blasting random people with the info. Also, please do not bug journalists or famous game developers! Well, unless you know them personally and walk their dog regularly or something. 6. Back to the Basics: Some of these you might have done already, but please look just in case! Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Vote us up on Steam Greenlight ------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks again! As I was writing this, we actually passed $100,000, so I had to go back and rewrite it! Man, this campaign just keeps climbing. You are all amazing! Wow. Just... wow. We’re finally there. Our Kickstarter Goal is achieved. We can make this game now, and it’s all thanks to you. Thank you so much from the bottom of our hearts. Thank you to those who were the first to support Delver’s Drop and spread the word. Thank you to those who gave us confidence with their pledges during the lean middle days. Thank you to those who rode in on this last tidal wave of awesomeness. Thanks to everyone who shared with their friends. Thanks to the press for giving us a few moments of your time and sharing your viewership. Thank you. We’ve still got a week to go and the potential for some Stretch Goal features to be added to the game — we’re very excited about these possibilities. More classes, more content, more modes... but we can talk about that tomorrow. Today the Pixelscopic crew is going to tell our friends and family about this amazing thing that happened. Thank you fans. Thank you friends. - Ryan Baker, Coby Utter, Ryan Burrell Before we get into the long-promised story behind the Drop (or as much of it as we're going to tell right now)... some great news! Over the weekend the campaign went from about $50,000 to over $69,000 in support. This is of course an amazing jump, and we're incredibly grateful! So first and most importantly — a huge welcome to all new backers! This will probably be the first update for many of you, so we hope that you'll also check out previous updates to read more about the game and its mechanics. Just look at the Kickstarter page ( <url>— we're getting really close to our goal of $75,000 (insert applause for our backers)! But we still have 8 days to go. So instead of basking in success, let's keep pushing forward to meet the goal soon and hit some of the Stretch Goals! Keep liking / tweeting / sharing all of the above articles, videos, and media, as well as telling anyone you can about the campaign! Thanks again for your incredible support... and now to the story! ------------------------------------------------------------ The World of the Drop Surrounded by Murk Swamps stands the Cornus Spire — a fragmented spike of mountain, miles tall and isolated, into which were constructed the Wandering Halls, where the Delvers are imprisoned. At its center is the Drop - a hole that tunnels deep into and below the mountain’s core. THE TALE Your characters are a set of scoundrels, the remnants of old adventuring guilds. These miscreants make their livings in less than legitimate trades in the fortress city of Spirewatch. This trade town fosters shady dealings, having fallen into disrepair under the shadow of the towering castle its stone gates once led to - The Wandering Halls, secluded abode of the reclusive Gilt King. This castle hold wraps around and is carved into a massive single mountain called the Cornus Spire, a cloud-penetrating stone pinnacle thrust skyward out of vast Murk swamps below it. Only a few miles away from Spirewatch, the castle walls can be seen to shift mysteriously, its rooms and towers, walls and parapets folding and rearranging themselves, propelled by mechanisms deep within the Spire. Living below this strange and impenetrable towering fortress, the ne’er-do-wells of Spirewatch ply their shady trades cautiously. For in spite of the chances for fortune, Spirewatch is frequently raided by the royal family’s gangs of guards — those adventurers unlucky enough to be (rightly or wrongly) apprehended for misdeeds are dragged off to be held within the Wandering Halls, never to be heard from again. The prisoners are stuffed into a ricketty cages and hoisted on immense chains to the highest levels of the towering castle structure. Shackled in this freezing stratospheric prison known as The Chill, the adventurers wait in cells with others of their guild class. THE DELVERS For unknown reasons, the jailers will periodically release one prisoner, and order them down the Drop — an immense hole that tunnels deep into the mountain’s core — with the promise of loot, fortune, and freedom. At every level though the Drop is sealed, closing off ancient and abandoned levels of the castle’s shifting structure, and it can only be opened through exploration, puzzle solving, and battle. Each Delver tries to go as far down as they can, descending toward ground level, hoping for escape from the dungeons surrounding the Drop. They also begin to find that some people are still living inside the castle structure: lost souls sealed off from the outside world, each with a story to tell. But few things are truly known about these dungeons. Does this hole lead to freedom, or just deeper under the earth? For the adventurous Delvers, either option beats rotting in a frigid jail cell. And every time a Delver dies in their escape attempt, the jailers release another. THE DANGERS What each Delver doesn’t know is that every predecessor who failed to find freedom returns as a skeletal version of their former selves — the Undelver wight. They bear the weapons and some previously equipped items and are very agile, making them incredibly dangerous. But defeat an Undelver, and you may just pry your previous weapons from their now fully dead skeletal hands! Since no Delvers survive for long, it’s never been discovered how or why the Undelvers return to life. But it seems these wights may be connected to the magically sealed tombs that enclose the living spirits of Princes and Princesses — the Gilt King’s royal children. Hidden away in the recesses of the castle, a Delver will occasionally stumble upon these sepulchral doors. But if they find their way in, they may have to grant the royal child’s request... or escape like the scoundrels they are. But the dungeon seems to have a mind of its own, twisting and changing for every new adventurer. And at the end of each zone, the ancient core of the dungeon blocks the Delvers’ passage with a Chamber Guardian. Manifestations of the living dungeon core, they are room-sized beings animated by magic and ancient mechanisms. These bosses cannot truly be defeated, only temporarily deactivated to allow passage... so even if one Delver succeeds, another may have to brave the Guardian Chamber once more. And there is only one way to improve one’s chances at surviving the Drop - to find and consume what the jailers call a Stranger’s Heart. A severed heart floating above a pristine pillar, these items are found in rooms brimming with traps designed to eradicate those who attempt to penetrate them. The allure is that a Stranger’s Heart increases a Delver’s life, but at severe risk... the curses that weave through the Drop will make the Delver’s pay tenfold for their theft. And even after extending one’s life, the question remains — who is the Stranger? And what is the purpose behind the Drop? ------------------------------------------------------------ That's it for now! We want to avoid spoiling anything, so you'll just have to wait for the game to come out if you want to learn more. We'll be putting out more updates later in the week, so stay tuned. Thanks for reading! Quick reminder: We're livestreaming at <url>"Let's Play" videos. The Delver's Drop demo he's playing is essentially the same build we'll be showing at PAX East later this month — though we'll be continuing to make improvements between now and then! Catch you soon, and thanks for pushing our campaign past $51k! Hi, everyone! Since the last time we posted, your support has surpassed $46k, over 60% of the goal! Thanks so much for your continued encouragement, and a special welcome to all of our new backers! We're really excited about what the next week has in store for us. Remember to tell your friends to check out our campaign by March 12th! --------------------------------------------------------- Livestream Based on your requests, we're going to do a livestream in two days! <url>–3pm CST / GMT-6 (1-4pm EST, 10am-1pm PST) We will play the current version of our "Endless Drop" survival mode, and will respond to comments and questions from both press and fans while on the air. If you have a question, please post in the comments bar next to the video during the livestream — we won't be able to get to everything, but we'll try to answer as many questions as possible. And you'll get to see our wonderfully bearded faces plus new gameplay footage! --------------------------------------------------------- PAX East We would also like to officially announce that we will be exhibiting at PAX East on March 22-24. We would love for you all to come by our booth, play the game, and take home some sweet Delver's pins! We will be showing the Endless Drop mode here as well, so get ready for a series of randomly selected rooms, and see how deep you can delve! --------------------------------------------------------- Twitter Q&amp;A We've been answering a lot of questions on Twitter in order to connect better with that community. Hit us up @delversdrop with questions of your own! We're having fun chatting with a such a wide audience, some of which are hearing about this campaign for the first time — so spread the word! Next up: A massive story update! We know this is the update many of you have been waiting for! We're pleased to present: Onward to the details! iOS &amp; Android After doing some more research, talking to other developers, and looking into the details, we now have a solution for mobile distribution. We’re happy to announce that iOS and Android versions will be included for all backers at the Pre-Order tier ($15) and higher when they are released in February 2014! Special thanks to backer TouchGameplay for pointing us toward a ton of helpful information that helped make this happen! OUYA We’ve mentioned in our F.A.Q. that we intend to release on Ouya at some point. After receiving a lot of interest asking about the Ouya, we decided to take a more in-depth look at what would be required to port our engine to the Ouya. After some further research, we are confident that we can deliver an Ouya version simultaneously with the iOS and Android versions in February 2014. All backers at the Pre-Order tier ($15) and higher will also get the full Ouya version of the game! Multi-platform Magic Supporting as many platforms as possible (and as seamlessly as possible) has been a central principle in our development philosophy. While we cannot facilitate the buy-once-play-everywhere model once the game is at retail, we can facilitate it here via Kickstarter and reward all of you for coming on board to help us finish development at this early stage. So to summarize: At the Pre-Order tier ($15) or higher you will get: PC / Mac versions in October 2013 iOS, Android, and Ouya versions in February 2014 Linux version in 2014 (or at launch in October 2013 if our stretch goal is met) We think that’s a pretty awesome deal and hope many of you are excited about it too! --------------------------------------------------------------------- *Notes, aka Fine Print: We will not have Alpha or Beta access for iOS / Android / Ouya. Backers will receive these games upon release in February. Any exclusive content you receive via your pledge at any level(s) will grant you that content on any/all devices of your choice. However, you may have to download these items separately per device. (This is still being determined). Quick update: we're doing a livestream called "Alive and Kicking" with Bumblebee at: 4:30-5 pm EST / 1:30-2pm PST! Bumblebee is the developer of another Kickstarter project, Days of Dawn , which is ending today. They're talking with a number of teams who also have Kickstarter projects to discuss the games and celebrate their Kickstarter campaigns — whether ending or ongoing. Watch it at <url>#r=-rid-&amp;s=em If you're curious about the full roster of those involved: <url>’ve beaten it? Or even after you’ve uncovered its deeper secrets? On to replay, narrative, level caps, and all the reasons you’ll delve for years! IMPORTANT: Please remember that the game is still in development, and the features and systems listed below are (mostly) not 100% final. We may have to make changes to ensure the best experience possible. But we’ll let you know as things are adjusted, and we hope you can help us find the best solutions through early Alpha Access! ($25 tier and up) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The story in Delver’s Drop is probably familiar to you by now — you’re a ne’er-do-well, scoundrel, a miscreant, whatever. You’ve been imprisoned unjustly, or maybe sorta justly. You probably deserve it, if we’re really honest with ourselves. So you’re set “free”, with the big caveat of being stuck in a giant deadly maze where you have to jump down a hole called the Drop to progress. And you just want to find your way out, right? As it turns out, there is more to the Drop than fighting toward the exit and collecting some treasure along the way. There are bigger things happening than just the life-and-death struggle of a prisoner trying to find their way out of a mountain dungeon complex. Much bigger things. So what do you do with your altruistic bent toward fighting the good fight, finding all the secrets, freeing the prisoners, and generally becoming a hero? Well you’ll probably just die a lot, until you learn to survive. But if you happen to die less often, or you really don’t mind the prospect of death, these are amazing adventures and achievements in store for you. The narrative will be communicated in several ways: environmental ambience; secret tomes, tablets, and messages; player character monologue and non-player character (NPC) dialog. The story will be revealed organically, based on the random generation of levels, items, and NPCs, as well as how / when / where the player encounters these elements. These will be conveyed through text boxes that pop up naturally in the game space, and fade from view when you move the character away. No game-pausing dialog boxes where you button-mashing through walls of text! Think Chrono Trigger, but even more ambient. The game won’t be chatty - you can even ignore or walk away from NPCs or objects who will promptly shut up and allow you to go about your business. We do, however, want to convey a lot of interesting story fragments, so the player characters will react to events and objects, enemies will spout the occasional babble, and even the walls themselves may talk... Each class will have unique dialog that fits their character, which means that you’ll have to play the game with all of them to see their unique points of view and get their entire background story. We will also pepper the levels with clues and books for them to find that will also reveal more about the overarching narrative. NPCs will play heavily into this as well, as they pass along legends and rumors about the Drop and its inhabitants. Since each character’s backstory will be slowly revealed across multiple zones, this is a huge motivator for replay. So while you can swap classes at any time, those who want the full story may prefer to play the game through multiple times with a different character for each run. We’re also going to have a number of alternate endings depending on how you play, how many secrets you uncover, and how many of the Drop’s magically-ensnared prisoners you interact with. We may also offer a “New Game Plus” story mode with a completely alternate narrative path — but only if the higher Stretch Goals are reached! Beyond the story elements in the main campaign and our myriad of alternate modes (see Update #2!), here are a few additional motivating factors to play the game through multiple times: Randomization! — Every time you play, you’ll see a totally different set of dungeons. The variety of dungeon layouts is truly infinite. Unlockables — Some Classes and many items will have requirements that must be met before they can be found. Maxing out Characters — You’ll want to level up every class to their full potential to experience the extent of their powers. Achievements — We will have a lot of in-game achievements, ranging from the unusual to the mundane to the insanely eccentric. Completion — We’ll have a percentage completion stat, which will show you how many of these item’s you’ve uncovered overall. You can only truly complete the game to 100% if you find every item and weapon, kill every enemy at least once, uncover all of the endings, max out all characters, and find all the secrets. This will be a massive endeavor for most players! You will eventually reach the limit of your perk tree, but that’s not the end — we will have a very high level cap. So why should you keep leveling up? For one, increasing your level also increases the likelihood that you will find rarer loot. Secondly, we want to give the player the flexibility to re-spec and alter the branches of the perk tree. This allows you to try out another path — for instance swapping your special ability’s fire elemental modifier for an ice modifier. We will include at least one secret character class (more if we reach Stretch Goal expansions), and some classes that you have to unlock before they are playable. Some will be easy to unlock — either unlocked by time played or zones completed — while others will be story based or hidden in secrets wrapped in enigmatic bundles of mystery. We will also have a very special version of each class that you can unlock if you both max out that character’s level / perk tree, and complete the story (and/or other requirements) with that character. Think of this as a “New Game Plus” mode for an individual class, giving them new or different abilities while adding challenge. We’ll be offering in-game achievements, and will try to support as many external achievement systems as possible. For instance, if we get through Steam’s Greenlight ( go vote for us! ) we will definitely have Steam Achievements. We’ll have a wide variety of stats that are tracked and achievements that you’ll gain through extended play or by doing fun and crazy things in the game. Here are a few random examples: Kill every enemy in the game at least once Kill certain enemies a certain number of times Find a complete “set” of items Find all the unique items in the game Find every secret vault Carry a useless item from the top of the Drop all the way to the bottom Hit 10 spiders with costly magical tomes! Because of the near-endless replay possibilities, we want to offer a robust system for meta-gameplay enjoyment! Thanks for reading our Gameplay Mechanics, part 3 of 3. We still have a lot more to show over the next two+ weeks of the campaign, so keep checking back! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FAQs These are additional questions that have been asked about the game features, but are a little too detailed to put into the general home page FAQs: Q: Can I save the game? What if I want to start over? A: Yes, the game will be automatically saved at various intervals. We will offer several save profiles, with the option of deleting a profile to start the game fresh. Q: Can I have true permadeath? I want to punish myself. A: Yes, we may offer a “hardcore” setting (from the options menu) that will force the player to start at the very beginning every time they die. No shortcuts, no “semi-permadeath,” and no incremental progress. The Drop would be re-sealed, all levels re-randomized, and all progress lost. Totally optional! Q: Will some classes be required to complete certain puzzles? Will the game be easier with certain classes? A: No, the game can be completed with any of the character classes - meaning all puzzles will be solvable. There is always the chance that some scenarios will be better with one class than another. But we will balance them so that players will have adequate challenge in any situation, with any class. Q: Will weapons / armor / items be reflected on the character? A: Weapons and shields will be visible and reflect the actual equipped items. We are currently not planning on changing the character art to reflect any other equipment, since this would vastly increase our art needs. Q: Will I be able to change the look of my character? A: Probably not, for similar reasons mentioned above – the cost would be very great. We will look into some minor forms of customization or alternate costumes for some classes, but the choices may be limited to 1-2 alternates per class, and these may be randomized when a new character is spawned. We will allow options for color swaps or alternate costumes in multiplayer (if the associated stretch goals are met). Q: What are the special Kickstarter voting classes? A: We’ll reveal this soon, but in the meantime, here is a teaser of some of our ideas for additional classes and their primary weapons! I’m burying it here at the bottom in hopes that no one will actually read this far... Huntsman — Longbow Templar — Spear DeathDealer — Katana Bard — Instruments Shaman — Whip Cleric — Flail Murkromancer — ??? Welcome to our Mechanics breakdown, part #2 of 3. This one is all about... Items and Dungeons So get ready for a ton of info about loot, weapons, randomization, puzzles, and more! IMPORTANT: Please remember that the game is still in development, and the features and systems listed below are (mostly) not 100% final. We may have to make changes to ensure the best experience possible. But we’ll let you know as things are adjusted, and we hope you can help us find the best solutions through early Alpha Access! ($25 tier and up) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The player can equip several types items, weapons, and wearables that occupy their own equipment slots. Primary weapon for the class type — will be reflected on the animated in-game character. Wearables — they player can equip things like boots, belts, and other clothing that may alter their movement or physics. Shield Modifiers — these alter how your shield (and shield bashing) function. Accessory or Relic - like rings and amulets. Typically improve the class's perks / skill tree. Up to 5 Sub-Items , including bombs, expendable wands, potions, etc. Some can be used indefinitely, but most are limited use. Since we are going with a no-grind approach, a skilled player could complete the game with the lowest level items, or by only using sub-items. We might even offer achievements for doing this! But choosing a loadout is always fun, and gearing up allows you to customize, and improve your perks and abilities. Each class has a particular weapon type that is unique to them. The Rogue, for instance, uses short swords. But each weapon will come in a large variety of randomly-spawned and randomly-generated iterations. Since we don’t want to create an “arms race” of incremental weapon power increases, these weapons will feature the following combinations of parameters: Range — how far the weapon will reach, or the distance a shot will fire before dissipating. Sweep / Spread — how wide a sword slash will cover, or how large of an area a hammer strike will affect, and so on. Speed Stats — Includes wind-up, speed, and recharge. How long the charge up lasts before an attack; how fast a weapon slashes (or its projectile fires); and then after an attack, how quickly the character “reloads” or is prepped for the next attack. Knockback — how hard the weapon knocks enemies or objects backward on impact. Elemental / Special Properties — Some weapons may have a percentage chance of causing elemental damage, or other unique effects. Want a sword that causes explosions like it has as freakin’ stick of dynamite on the blade? We thought so. When you start a new character, you will have no items, weapons, or equipment! A bit of flimsy shield is all you get. You’ll have to learn to survive in the dungeon with that shield and your wits... until you find a randomly dropped item or three. These items will be discovered in treasure chests, in piles of rubble and refuse, or by killing enemies. Some will be specifically designed rare items, while others will have some randomized properties for variety. We won't have fully randomized generation to the degree of Diablo or Torchlight. But we will offer a large variety through stat variance. And the more unique items will spawn both on lower dungeon levels, and based on the higher level your character class is! You will also randomly find Secondary Items that go in your usable item slots. These will be generated based on what you might need in the current dungeon... or they may be generated for no reason at all. But you should find a way to use them anyway! You can hold 5 Secondary Items in your Sub-Item queue. These are almost always expendable, and will display the number of uses in the interface. One item will always be in the “active” slot, and can be activated or used by pressing the X Button. You can “rotate” the queue with the controller triggers, sliding the active item left and right to swap it for another. You may drop a currently carried item if you don’t have an available slot and you want to pick up a new item. Or if you expend all of an item’s limited uses... poof, it’s gone. These randomly dropped, limited-use items will keep the player on their toes. You’ll have to conserve your "ammunition," constantly altering your strategy based on what’s available. Something you’re probably wondering: What if you find a weapon that isn’t meant for your class? Good news: you can still use it, but they will usually be limited use. So a Rogue can use a Sorcerer-style wand, but since that isn’t their specialty, they can only use it a few times before breaking it. Wands are delicate like that. Or maybe rogues are clumsy. So stick with your primary weapon for most attacks, but swap out for a secondary weapon from another class when you need to! Some items will also affect the player instantly, like a power-up. This will keep the pace fast and give a lot of unpredictable variety, while also keeping your equipment streamlined. We want it to feel like a true dungeon dive: If you were in an ancient labyrinth, you wouldn't always find the exact tool you needed at every turn. So we want players to be inventive with what they do find. Remember that your items are (usually) limited in use, and since death is semi-permanent... you only have one shot with the items you've got. So sometimes it's worth it to use up an item to get out of a tight spot. We're designing the game so that there won't always be a single tool for a single problem, and some items have unexpected results. Players will have to use items in spontaneous and inventive ways, or leave behind a favorite item because it won't work in the current situation. So in other words: be cautious, but be inventive and take a few risks! And if you have to throw that rare Rune Tome across the room to kill a minor baddy... well, that’s probably better that than dying. We're also developing some more mysterious item functions, meaning you won't always know exactly what an item does until you use it for the first time. Some items may have unintended side effects or passive properties when in your inventory. You’ll have to discover these properties as you go! Think of it like unidentified items in a Roguelike - sometimes you have to try the item out and see what happens. We will be creating a large number of hand-crafted rooms ranging from horde-combat arenas to mind-melting puzzle areas. These rooms will contain internal random generation, including random placement of crates (and their contents), a random number and type of enemies, as well as placement of other obstacles or traps. But the primary randomization will occur when a dungeon level is generated, by combining a set of rooms from our existing pool of designs, and using algorithms to structure them into a continuous dungeon with meta-puzzles and interesting navigation. So for example, keys will be generated in some rooms that unlock doors elsewhere in the dungeon — and this process of key / locked door generation is dynamically generated when a dungeon is created by the game. The layout of the floor, the rooms in the floor, and how you find your way through the floor will be different every time you die and replay it. We are also adding overarching dungeon navigation puzzles to the mix by allowing the player to manipulate the structure of some dungeon levels. In the story behind the Drop, the dungeon system you're exploring moves and changes based on mechanics within the mountain that it’s built into. Since these rooms move and the floor is randomized after a character dies, it makes sense that occasionally the player would be able to find a switch or other mechanic to alter the layout from within the dungeon. What if you found magical keys that generated a different room on the other side of a door every time you changed keys? You’ll have to use a key on different doors to navigate through them, find other magical keys, backtrack, and then swap the keys to different doors to change the room layout, therefore changing the pathway through the dungeon. Yeah, that probably didn’t make much sense in text form... but that’s what puzzles are all about! We will introduce different mechanics in different zones, so that dungeon navigation itself becomes a progressively puzzling endeavor. So yeah, expect to die a bit. But don’t worry! Like we mentioned a few times, the game has “semi-permadeath.” So you lose a little progress, the current dungeon level re-randomizes, and you lose whatever items you were carrying. So you just try, try again. Pretty easy right? What we haven’t told you is that whenever you die, and depending on how you die, you may create a greater challenge to contend with. Dead adventurers might, just maybe, usually, unfortunately... come back as super dangerous undead skeleton warriors with their last carried weapon. So every time you drop down after a failure, you’ll have to be wary of an undead version of your previous character incarnation. Oh, and what if you pick a character and decide that they really suck for the current dungeon level? Well you could just jump off a cliff. Or... you could use a “suicide booth” (well, really an iron maiden) near the Drop entrance. The benefits of this are that you can collect all of your currently carried items... but you’ll generate a particularly nasty skeleton to contend with later. That’s a huge risk, but it might be worth it to keep your items or swap your class! The Drop is sealed at each level, preventing you from moving on to the next zone below. But as you progress you’ll solve puzzles, defeat bosses, and move mechanisms in the dungeons to open the Drop. Even if you die after a level has been unsealed, you can drop from the Jail at the top of the dungeon down to the last unsealed area. But of course that level will have been re-randomized, possibly leaving a few previous rooms, but mostly exchanging them for new ones. Just remember that if you die, you’ve just set loose a killer undead warrior, so the level just got harder! If you die too many times, the Drop will eventually re-seal itself, causing your progress to backslide. You then have to replay the previous level to unlock the Drop again. You can also manually reset a level by using mechanisms in the Jail to seal the drop, totally randomizing the level and removing any undead adventurers plaguing it. But you can’t undo this action! You’ll have to just play the previous level again to unlock the Drop seal that you just closed. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So what do you do after you’ve opened the Drop, faced your fears, equipped lots of awesome weapons, and used up a lot of cool items? And what will keep you playing even after you beat the game? Check back soon to read part 3, on Extended Play! As promised, this update is the grand Game Mechanics Unveiling! It’s basically a mini-manual for the game. Enjoy! This is part 1 of 3, specifically covering: Characters &amp; Class Mechanics IMPORTANT: Please remember that the game is still in development, and the features and systems listed below are (mostly) not 100% final. We may have to make changes to ensure the best experience possible. But we’ll let you know as things are adjusted, and we hope you can help us find the best solutions through early Alpha Access! ($25 tier and up) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The classes of miscreants in Delver’s Drop are all locked up in jail at the top of the dungeon. When you begin the game, you will pick one class whose cell the gaoler will open — letting one character out. You will then take that character to the Drop, a giant hole that tunnels down into the dungeons. Fortunately the jailers are constantly capturing new recruits, so you'll have plenty of prisoners to lead to their death. Or lead to their escape with fame and riches or whatever. But probably death. Oh, and you won’t start with any decent weapons right away. You’ll have to find those as you go. But before you jump to your demise, you can purchase some items from the Jail’s armory. The inventory will be somewhat random, but you can improve its stock as you play. The character classes come from an ancient adventuring guilds with their own specialized abilities and tactics. Several factors will differentiate each class from the others: Stats like amount of health and number of shields they can carry Their own specialized primary weapon Physics and movement properties such as acceleration, top speed, mass, and traction A unique perk tree Special Ability specific to that class Each class will also have their own backstory, related both to the character(s) and their respective guild. The more the player uses a class (and plays through multiple levels with them), the more they will learn about their mostly-infamous history. And each time you play, your new character will have a randomly chosen name since, you know, the last guy you were playing as died. Some of these names will be contributed by backers! ($40 tier and up). So what do you do once you drop a character down into the dungeon? These are the basic controls, with their default mapping on an X-Box 360 controller. We will also have (customizable) keyboard control, PS3 controller support, etc. Movement — Analog Stick / D-Pad. You run around and stuff! Some characters might also float, slide, or prance, but it will always occur in the direction you’re pressing. Primary Action / Attack — A Button. This is your primary action button, used for attacking enemies and opening treasure chests. You might also open doors and things, but mostly you’ll just smack stuff with a weapon. Swap Sub-Item — L/R Triggers. You can cycle through a queue of 5 secondary items, putting a different one into the active slot for use. These will also be accessible with keyboard numbers 1-5 for those who want that option! Use Sub-Item — X Button. Throw bombs, quaff potions, open spell books... this action uses whichever item is in the active slot! Special Class Ability — Y Button. This is your trump card, your super move, your perk activation command. It will be wildly different per class! Here are your points, variables, specs, and meters you'll see on screen and in your stat menu. All the fun stuff that number-crunching part of your brain expects in an RPG! Health (HP) — Each time you take a hit, you lose a heart... and when you run out of hearts your character will die. Shields — Shields stack over your hearts, and take damage first. You will only lose hearts if all Shields have been depleted. Coins — You can pick up money in a few denominations of coins, and use it to buy items in shops. Experience (XP) — You will gain experience points by killing enemies, solving puzzles, opening treasure chests, etc. These contribute to your level when they reach the required point value. Level — As you level up, you will find slightly better loot, and for each level you will put one point into your perk tree. Perk Trees — A set of skills and bonuses that are applied to abilities. You can upgrade these as you progress. Special Ability Meter — Each class has its own special move, which can be used when this meter is full. As the player defeats enemies and performs other actions, they will gain XP. This will contribute to the class's level, and this level is persistent for the class regardless of individual character deaths. This is what we're calling "semi-permadeath” — when the player dies, they will lose their currently carried items (and possibly some gold), and the dungeon level they are in will re-randomize causing some progress to be lost. However, you will keep any XP and levels earned. Leveling in Delver's Drop does not increase the character's base stats (health, attack power, etc), since we want to keep the stats consistent in the vein of other classic Action RPGs. We're trying to really emphasize player skill and mastery of the gameplay while avoiding any form of grinding, either for XP or loot. But leveling does offer other bonuses, such as more interesting weapons that can be equipped or purchased, and more importantly it lets you upgrade or re-spec your perks for that class! When you level up, you will be able to upgrade or alter one of several perks for your chosen class on their skill tree. The trees will usually have the following 3 branches for a given class, granting improvements to: 1. Innate perks or passive abilities. Examples: find rarer items, move faster, have a chance of “dodging” projectiles. 2. The character's standard weapon attack. Examples: additional range, sweep, knockback. 3. Class-specific special ability. Examples: increased power, elemental attributes. Each class has a special ability that can be activated once their special meter has fully charged. A class’s ability and method of charging the meter will be unique. Abilities may range from defensive to offensive to navigational. The method of charging the meter will vary widely — from collecting gold to killing enemies to running a certain distance. We will design each ability to suit the given class's play style, and players can use the special move to amp them up at the right moments, escape tight situations, or just blaze through opposition. From continuous wand blasts to stealth spells or giant area-of-effect carnage, these moves are your ticket to victory. Remember to fine-tune them via your perk tree! Every class in the game can carry shields, though the maximum amount they carry may differ. Whenever the player is shielded, damage will be absorbed by the shield, which is then destroyed. This protects the player from losing hearts. However, shield loss has a secondary function: it can be used to knock back and even damage enemies. If the player comes in contact with an enemy when shielded, the enemy will be knocked back as if attacked. Though the player will lose the shield, they may also deal damage to their opponent. This can be used to defeat enemies when no items are available, or to attack some enemies that may be impervious to normal weapons. We want players to rely on their speed and momentum, and encourage the idea of sometimes just tackling enemies when there is no other option. Sure you’re sacrificing some shielding, but it might be worth it to knock that nasty monster into the spikes right behind them, or punt them down a bottomless pit. And shield fragment pick-up items will be much more common than heart-healing items, so they can be replenished easily. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- That's all the exciting info our little fingers could type for now. Look forward to our next update tomorrow, for information on items and dungeon mechanics! Current Status Sitting at just shy of $33k and 43% funded, the last week has brought out an incredible amount of support for Delver's Drop. Thank you very much for not only backing us, but also helping us spread the word. There is still a good ways to go to reach our goal and we'll definitely need all of the help we can get! VisionCon The past 2 days we've been exhibiting Delver's Drop at VisionCon here in Springfield. This is the third time we've demoed the game publicly (the others being PAX Prime 2012 and G.A.M.E. 2012) and we always gain a lot of valuable insight. We put together the first implementation of Endless Drop mode and let the convention attendees have at it. Here is a young Link doing some delving and dropping: There wasn't a lot of QA time available for this demo and as such some rooms were extremely difficult and others quite easy (and a few with funny bugs.) Despite that, the reception was quite good and a few folks who had previously played the demo at G.A.M.E. were impressed with the improvements. It is both exhilarating and terrifying to put your hard work on display for the public, never knowing what to expect. VisionCon serves us as a good opportunity to get prepared for PAX East next month, where a magnitude of order more people will see and play the game. Interviews This past week we were afforded the opportunity to have a chat with the folks over at arpgamer.com and discussed a lot of details about both ourselves and the game. You can listen to the podcast interview here: ARPGamer Interview with Pixelscopic . We were also very fortunate to snag some of Craig Stern's time, the man behind indierpgs.com , and divulge a good deal of additional information there as well. Indie RPGs Interview Hopefully between the two of these interviews there is enough information to hold over any and everyone curious about more of the game's details. We're still working on an update that contains even more information and will be posting that once it is finished. Last Bit We've come a long ways in just 8 days, but the battle is not won yet! We will continue to work on additional media, updates, and details to share with you all as we continue to try and expand the reach of this campaign. Let us know if you have any questions and as always, thank you very much. This will be a quick update! For those who wanted to know a bit more about our team and company, this one is for you... More on the game coming very soon! Pixelscopic [ ˌpik səl ˈskäp ik ] means that every aspect of our work reflects a love of the smallest nuances of the digital medium. We founded the company in 2010 in Missouri, USA (based in the cities of Purdy &amp; Springfield). Pixelscopic's founding principles were the development of games and user experiences of impeccable quality. We craft otherworldly experiences with passion for subtle aesthetic detail and creative ambitions as expansive as our imaginations. Over the course of their careers, our highly experienced team members have shipped 30+ titles combined (mostly for consoles) — filling roles from project leads, to department directors, to lead game designer. The two commercially-released games Pixelscopic has developed since it was founded are Moshi Monsters: Moshling Zoo and Moshi Monsters: Moshlings Theme Park , both for Nintendo DS (in cooperation with Mind Candy, Black Lantern Studios, and Activision). Since starting Pixelscopic, we've been driven toward creating original games for multiple platforms, the first example of which is Delver's Drop . Our goal is to focus on contemporary game design and high-definition 2D graphics, while gazing back at the wonders of our shared gaming past. Whether we are expounding epic lore or rewarding simple successes, we want our games to take root deep in the imaginative hearts of our fans. Our Team Ryan Baker , @ryancbaker — Role: Art, Animation, Design Ryan (aka “Baker”) is the creative leader behind the company’s conceptual and aesthetic vision. A graphic designer and painter before he moved to game development, he started in the industry as a pixel artist and sprite animator. He later served as an art director and creative director on a number of console games. Since founding Pixelscopic with Coby, Ryan’s constant goal is to design nuanced yet tightly constructed games, and to expand the company's artistic process with techniques from his background in fine art and illustration. He plays the drums, and his prized possession is his console game collection, including a few rarities. Ever heard of Vib Ribbon? Oddly for an artist, he is our resident spreadsheet wizard... and once prototyped a game in Excel because he is just that insanely meticulous. On Delver's Drop: Ryan developed the art style, paints all of the environments and characters, and works a lot on our game design and systems development. He also created the lore and history of the world, and works closely with Burrell and Coby to continue its development. Coby Utter , @rand0mshade — Role: Engine / Tools / Gameplay / Programming Coby manages the long term technology vision for Pixelscopic and oversees business development and administration. He spent several years as a Lead Programmer and later Programming Director at another game company before going independent, and started Pixelscopic in 2010. Coby has a strong interest in entrepreneurial experimentation and is driven by a fast, flexible, and user-friendly approach to game technology. On a daily basis he is the driving force for both our company’s cross-platform engine and our gameplay programming foundations. He remains active on independent game development forums, keeps an eye out for interesting indie RPGs, and is working to rebuild his SNES collection (his favorite game is Chrono Trigger). Our resident globetrotter, he speaks Spanish fluently and habitually checks the weather in other countries... just out of curiosity. On Delver's Drop: Coby created the engine and handles basically all of our gameplay programming. He also adds most of the nuance to our physics and control handling, adding interesting touches like Z-height and elasticity. Ryan Burrell , @rcburrell — Role: Technical Art / Design Ryan (aka “Burrell”) serves as a jack-of-all-trades, contributing in the areas of game design, visual production, user interfaces, scripting, and everything tool-related, as well as our web development needs. Ryan has occupied a variety of different roles throughout his career ranging from technical support specialist, to developer, to graphic designer, and has worked in industries ranging from ISPs and e-commerce to boutique design. He joined the Pixelscopic team in early 2011 and cut his teeth on their first Nintendo DS project. Ryan enjoys staying abreast of current trends and methodologies in the tech and entertainment sectors. He still makes it a point to play with LEGOs in his free time and can be found most Friday nights fumbling through a D&amp;D 3.5 session — these two activities often occurring at the same time. He also enjoys gardening, and owns several poisonous plants that he warns house guests not to eat. On Delver's Drop: Burrell is the key pipeline manager between Baker's art and Coby's code, and makes sure that assets get implemented into our system. He also designs the UI, develops ideas for weapons and items, does almost all of our level design, and writes a decent bit of our lore and descriptions. ---------------------------------------------------------- Thanks for reading! If there is anything else you want to know about us, just drop some questions below in the comments section! Now that you’ve all had time to read the campaign, we thought you would be ready for even more info. So we wrote this update to give a better explanation of: Gameplay Modes Game Length &amp; Replay Compatibility &amp; System Requirements Technical Features Accessibility Modding This one might get a little technical toward the end, but the next update will (probably!) be all about the fun stuff — gameplay mechanics! ------------------------------------------------------------ Modes Some of these modes can be chosen through the pre-game menu system, while others can be uncovered or experienced in the midst of normal campaign play. Some of them will be in the base game, and some will only be developed if we attain our Stretch Goals (see our main Kickstarter page for more details on that). Campaign (Story Mode) The primary mode of play in Delver’s Drop. Players will embark on an epic dive into the dungeons of the Drop, uncovering its secrets and revealing the true story behind their characters’ imprisonment. As you play, you will progress to deeper levels of the dungeon and open the Drop to even lower floors. But each time you die, you have to start the current level over, with a totally new and random floor layout. With our unique “semi-permadeath” you’ll keep your class’s level and perks, but lose any items you were carrying. As you progress, you’ll reveal more and more about each individual class’s story – how they came to be imprisoned, the history of their guild, and how they fit into the story and world of the Drop. Endless Drop Mode (Survival / Fast Play) Only have a few minutes to kill? Don’t want to mess with the story or level navigation? In this mode, you’ll complete one random self-contained room after another. Then you’ll drop through a hole into the next totally random room, which could contain puzzles, loot, or tons of enemies. The game will track the highest number of rooms you’ve survived in one go. This mode has 100% PERMADEATH! Survival and an endless variety of puzzles and enemies is what it’s about. You can also use this mode to hone your skills for the main campaign. Horde Mode A set of several combat arenas, which spawn waves of enemies with increasing frequency and difficulty. Manipulate the environment and grab randomly dropped weapons and items to give yourself the advantage against the hordes! This mode will have a near-infinite number of waves, and will track your highest achieved wave as well as kill counts. Score multiplier power-ups and timed combo kill counts make this our true high-score power mode. 4-Player Co-op Horde Mode [STRETCH GOAL!] This expands the above Horde Mode so that up to 4 players (local only) can cooperate to slay the waves of baddies. Difficulty and numbers of monsters will be tightly balanced for the number of players present. 4-Player Competitive Deathmatch [STRETCH GOAL!] Ready to slay your friends? In this mode, up to 4 players (local only) can bash and slash each other in a set of gladiatorial arenas. Think of it this way: Super Smash Brothers and Zelda: Four Swords have a little Delver lovechild! You and your friends will each pick a character class, choose a deadly arena, then duke it out until only one player remains! The environments contain deadly traps — use them to your advantage. Enemies will periodically spawn — lure them toward your opponents. Power-ups will drop at random — grab them as a wild-card for victory. We hope this will be your new go-to party game! Drop-in Co-op Companion Mode [STRETCH GOAL!] We want to offer a way for players to experience the main campaign with 2nd player co-op, so your friend, significant other, child, or pet can experience the game with you without just having to watch. The primary player will have the ability to summon a menagerie of mystical pets, familiars, and phantoms that the 2nd player can control. The companion player’s abilities will be somewhat limited because we don’t want this to become a “cheat mode” that makes combat or puzzles too easy. Summoning a companion will require some cooldown or replenishment of energy before it can be used again to keep the game balance solid. Try taking turns with your companion so you can both experiment with our variety of summoned creatures! 100 Room Labyrinth Puzzle Mode [STRETCH GOAL!] We’re really excited to create difficult puzzles, but we wouldn’t want to randomly generate rooms that mercilessly kill anyone who isn’t a puzzle-solving genius. That would suck in a game with permadeath. So this mode is designed to let you beat your brains against each gordian knot of a room over and over until you master it... all without having to worry about getting sent back to the beginning of the dungeon. This is separate from the main campaign, so try try again! You can jump back to your farthest point of progress at any time, or choose to replay any previously played room in convenient puzzle game style. ------------------------------------------------------------ Game Length &amp; Replay: In such an early state of development, it’s difficult to determine what the game length will be. We would also have to factor in player skill, deaths, restarts, and so on. But our target is for the game to basically be near the length of one of the 2D Zelda games on your first playthrough. But because of the randomization elements, you won’t be able memorize levels — meaning it’s a challenge every time, allowing for a high degree of replayability. Our unique “semi-permadeath” should also increase the time investment, while making sure the game isn’t brutally punishing. And with our random secrets, if one wanted to complete every objective and find every single item, it will take much longer than a "normal" playthrough. The game will also encourage players to replay levels (or the entire game) with different character classes in order to experience all facets of the story from their different viewpoints! So in short... we promise it will be a lengthy and satisfying experience, and our Alpha Access backers ($25 and above) can help us track play times to make sure that is the case! With randomization and multiple character classes, and tons of secrets and collectibles, we are striving for infinite replayability. ------------------------------------------------------------ Compatibility &amp; System Requirements The following are our currently estimated minimum system requirements. These are subject to change slightly based on play-testing, quality assurance, and optimization. Desktops &amp; Laptops Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, or Mac OSX 10.7+ 1 Ghz or better processor 512+ MB RAM 64+ MB Graphics Memory (VRAM) iOS iPhone 4, 4S, or 5 iPod Touch 4th or 5th generation iPad 1, 2, 3 or 4 iPad Mini Android 1 Ghz or better processor 512+ MB RAM Android 2.3.3+ ------------------------------------------------------------ Features Incredible HD Visuals We create all of the art as high-resolution hand-painted images, usually 4-8x the resolution we plan to display it. These images are then animated and/or exported for use in the game at two texture resolutions for different devices, in order to optimize memory and performance against resolution. Combined with our highly custom graphics engine, this allows us to natively support resolutions up to 2880 x 1800 (encompasses Retina for the newest MacBook Pro), or as small as 480 x 320. We slightly crop and/or down-scale the graphics to suit your device, for every standard aspect ratio. We can display at any resolution in that range with absolutely no stretching, no up-scaling, and no letterboxing! This means that no matter what device or monitor you use, you get Delver’s Drop full-screen in as much crisp HD glory as your device can handle. Controls In addition to fully customizable keyboard controls, we will support a variety of controllers, including XBox 360 and PS3 controllers. Here is an example of our current control scheme for the 360 gamepad: Movement — Left Analog Stick / D-Pad Primary Weapon Attack — A Button Special Class Ability — Y Button Equipped Sub-Item — X Button Sub-Item Quick-Swap — B Button Cycle Sub-Items — L/R Bumpers or Triggers Mobile Touch Controls We also have a working prototype of our controls for touch devices (iOS, Android), and we’re confident that Delver’s Drop already has amazing touch controls. Honestly we still have some fine-tuning to do, but we think you’ll be surprised at how great and intuitive it feels when you play it. No clunky on-screen virtual sticks; just slide your finger a tiny bit and your Delver is off and running. You’ll cycle your sub-items just by swiping, and tap anywhere on the right side of the screen to attack. You’ll never have to worry about “missing” the attack button in the heat of battle! Accessibility Craig Kaufman brought to our attention the need for more information about accessibility, in reference to <url>’re working on the following options: Remappable Keys / Custom Controller Mapping will be completely supported. Changeable Font Visibility — We will attempt to offer another version of text display (possibly more like subtitles) so that the text can be displayed larger and with higher contrast for improved visibility. Color-Blind Usability — We have no plans to use color exclusively as the indicator for puzzles, so the game should be playable to those with limited color differentiation. We will attempt to further distinguish any color-coded objects by shape as well. Palette swaps are lame! Mouse-only Controls — We have talked about ways to implement mouse controls that might work similarly to our touch controls, where a simple mouse movement translates into character movement. This is still under consideration, but we feel that we will be able to find a comfortable solution to perform all of the game’s functions for mouse-only users, provided their mouse has at least 3 buttons and a scroll wheel. ------------------------------------------------------------ Modding The game features a custom scripting and database system based on XML, which uses both internally developed tools, as well as some free tools like Tiled , and commercially available tools like Spine . Everything in the game is moddable, from character properties to map layouts. We use these systems to quickly create new content, and we’re excited to see what the community can do once we release these features. Modding documentation may be available shortly after the game’s release, though we will make efforts to have this information available at launch. ------------------------------------------------------------ Thanks for making it all the way through our (lengthy) second update! Don't forget to share this information with friends and through the social mediaverse. We could use even more tweets , likes , shares , and Greenlight votes . And don't hesitate to let us know how we can keep improving this Kickstarter campaign with your comments and direct messages! Contents: Release Platforms / Prices / Dates Clarifications Linux clarification Earlier Access - Alpha, Closed Beta, Open Beta Tier Adjustments NEW All-Digital Deluxe Tier More Signed Reward Items Response to Comments on Exclusive Content Conventions! ------------------------------------------------------------ Hey, Delvers! 20% in 3 days? Our backers are incredible! Since launch, it’s been incredibly exciting for all of us at Pixelscopic. We've put a lot of love into Delver's Drop and are thrilled that so many people are interested in it. Thank you for all of your generosity, support, questions, and suggestions! Keep it all coming, we're trying to respond to everyone and address all of the feedback we're getting to make this campaign as transparent and beneficial to our backers as possible. Now on to cleaning up and improving the campaign: ------------------------------------------------------------ Change Log / Clarifications The following are a list of changes and clarifications we’ve made to improve the campaign, from better wording to better reward info! 1. Release Pricing Clarification → Section changed: “Ready to Delve” We wanted to clarify that the game will release at $15 in October. This means that by pre-ordering the game at the $15 tier, you are getting the game at cost, PLUS getting all of the included bonuses digital items, for free! We’re now also throwing in early Open Beta Access to the game at this tier as an added bonus. 2. Linux → Section changed: “Ready to Delve” and “Stretch Goals” Due to lack of attention and clarity on our part, there has been some confusion about the Linux port. It has always been our intention to put Delver's Drop on Linux! We just didn't exactly mention that... Whoops. However, we are a small team and are developing our own technology. Right now, the engine only supports PC, Mac, and iOS; Android is close behind in terms of completion. Since we need to focus on finishing the game, it would not be possible for us to launch the Linux version day-and-date with the PC / Mac versions. We didn't include Linux because we just weren't sure when we could finish it, but since there is so much demand, we're going to make it a reality. But for the above reasons, we included the Linux stretch goal: with the extra funds, we would be able to bring on additional programming support to ensure that PC, Mac, and Linux versions launch simultaneously. Sorry for the confusion! 3. Mobile - iOS &amp; Android → Section changed: “Ready to Delve” It also wasn’t very clear how mobile is or isn’t included in the campaign. Unfortunately, we do not currently have a way to distribute mobile builds, and therefore there is no reward tier that includes mobile (iOS or Android) versions. These would have to be purchased separately upon release. BUT! If we do find a way to distribute builds (and we promise we will try, cross our heart and hope to die), we will include iOS and Android builds to every backer from the $15 tier and up. We’ll keep you posted if / when this changes! 4. Expansion of Milestones + Game Access → Section changed: “Ready to Delve,” “Progress &amp; Milestones,” and “Loot Drop” We’re now adding Alpha Access and an Open Beta! See the next section below for more information. We’ve adjusted wording in the campaign to improve the clarity of the above items. Let us know if we goofed anything else up! ------------------------------------------------------------ Reward Improvements / Additions → Section changed: “Loot Drop” Please Note: Unfortunately we CANNOT change the tier descriptions in the sidebar once anyone has made a pledge at that tier, so if something isn't clear, please let us know! Based on feedback, we’ve also upgraded two tiers, and added another: CHANGE 1 — Earlier Access We've received a lot requests to consider opening access to the game at Alpha and this was actually something we considered heavily prior to launch. After talking it over again and planning for the logistics, we've decided to go ahead and give earlier access to the game! What does that mean exactly? $25 Tier Improvement - ALPHA ACCESS! It means that at the $25 Tier, you will get access to the game during its Alpha stages, in approximately late June. This tier will still include exclusive Closed Beta + forum access in August. Note that forum access may or may not be available during the Alpha, but we will still be accepting feedback. $15 Tier Improvement - OPEN BETA ACCESS! We are now also adding an Open Beta phase, which will occur approximately in September. Open Beta means that it will not be exclusive to Kickstarter backers, and we may allow other players to participate. We are still determining how the Open Beta will function with regards to other participants. Difference between Alpha, Closed Beta, &amp; Open Beta: Alpha players will be able to give early feedback that will influence the game in a very direct way. At this early point, we can still change some features and improve systems. Closed Beta will allow players to actively participate in the polish phase, suggesting minor improvements and adjustments. However major features and systems will be locked in by this point. Open Beta will allow users to play the game early, in a stable form. Some bugs and very minor polish items may be present, and you can help us find and solve these issues! We truly mean it when we say that we want your help to make Delver's Drop as good as it can be, and giving you access to the build earlier simply makes too much sense to not do. CHANGE 2 — NEW TIER: All-Digital Deluxe ($50) Numerous suggestions have come in asking about the possibility of an All-Digital tier, which is a great idea for those who prefer digital goods over physicals. The new tier is only $50 and includes: All rewards from the $5, $15, $25, and $40 tiers except for the postcard. Kickstarter exclusive Character class from the $60 tier All in-game item packs from the $15-100 tiers It's incredibly important to us that we offer very high value rewards across all the tiers and we want to fine tune this campaign to perfection! CHANGE 3 — More Signed Items! We are also upgrading the $100 and $120 tiers so that both the physical game case and the softbound artbook will be signed by the full dev team. Note: Other items marked as signed will most likely only be signed by the artist. ------------------------------------------------------------ Exclusive Content – Response to Comments We have had some comments regarding exclusive in-game content (both inside of Kickstarter and on other sites) that need to be addressed. We definitely understand the frustration with exclusive content. The in-game content rewards were an addition we made before launch to increase the value proposition for Kickstarter backers — though this unfortunately ends up withholding some content from non-backers. We understand that some are unhappy with this decision, and regret dividing our user base in this way. Unfortunately we cannot alter rewards once a tier has been backed, so the in-game content rewards cannot be changed. We're obligated to keep the items marked "exclusive" as they are, under Kickstarter's terms of service. BUT... after we further explain how items work in the game, and the nature of these exclusive items, we feel that all parties will be better satisfied. So please be patient for our next update, and continue to give us more suggestions on how to work this out and improve the campaign! In the meantime, to give a better value to those who want the complete game: We created the new ALL-DIGITAL TIER, in which all of the digital content is available, including the exclusive Kickstarter in-game content. This addition allows us to offer a high-value digital-only package, without the need to substantially alter our existing tiers (which is against the rules). Obviously this is a compromise, but we hope that it at least shows we are willing to improve what we can to make this campaign and the game as rewarding as possible, for Kickstarter backers and non-backers alike. ------------------------------------------------------------ Conventions: VisionCon and PAX East This upcoming weekend (February 15th - 17th) we will be exhibiting at VisionCon here in Springfield, Missouri. Check out <url>’re really impressed / flattered / amazed with all of the interest, praise, articles, comments, shares, tweets... We appreciate every mention, from articles on a major gaming site to the smallest Facebook comment — wish we could mention you all by name, but I think we’ve already lost track of all the love. Please share our campaign with anyone you think would be interested, and we will keep working to spread the word as well! Thanks for reaching out! The project is still ongoing. While we've had a lot of struggles with the engine and development in general, we're now making better progress, and plan to post updates in the future. Hi, Ju. Yes, we would be happy to send your Humble Key - we'll send a PM shortly. We will release a demo on Steam at some point, but it may not be for a while longer. We'll keep everyone posted. Thanks for the kind words - we're excited to bring another Action RPG to the scene as well! Hi, Jeremy. Yes, we're still working on it! Hey, Quady! We're definitely hanging in there with this wild year, and still working on it. Progress has been picking up, and we'll show footage as soon as possible. Our overall goals the game design haven't changed, though we're of course tuning everything to keep pace with the industry (for example, it's super easy for us to support 4k+ since the base artwork is high-res). We're inevitably cutting a few things, but we want to make sure the Kickstarter's stated goals for the game are fulfilled. We miss those old forum days, and hope they'll come back eventually (maybe through something more modern like Slack - we'll see!) We're really trying to make progress, and while we know it probably can't recapture that same early excitement from years ago, we really want to make it something special, even if we all have a few more gray hairs. Thank you for everything you did on the forums back in the day, and for your support - glad you checked in! Hi, Aaron! Thanks for checking in. We're doing alright - always wish we could make progress faster, but we're making some headway. Hi, David. Thanks for the positive vibes and encouragement! Hi, Kethrian. We are still working on the game, though progress has obviously been slower than we would like. We do plan to deliver all rewards, and are not attempting to scam anyone. All funds from the campaign have gone directly to the development of the game (and reward costs). Hi, Kyle. We are still working on the game, and plan to complete it! Hi, Aaron. Thanks for checking in! Unfortunately, we haven't updated the website in quite a while, since we're trying to keep our focus on the game itself. We would love to get the game on as many platforms as possible upon completion - no promises, but we've always hoped that a Nintendo system would be possible someday, and the Switch is a very attractive option for an Action-RPG! Thanks again for your kind words and well wishes! Hi, Zesty. We are very sorry to have soured your experience with crowd-funded videogame projects. We are trying very hard to complete the project, but we understand your lack of confidence. We hope to restore that confidence as we make more progress. Thanks for the encouragement, Andrew! Hi, Martin. We are not giving up or letting it die off, though we understand your concerns. We're continuing to make progress, and will provide updates in the future. It is not our intention to abandon the project. Hi, Michael. The clay models have been produced, but have been planned to go out with other larger physical rewards in a single shipment. The reason for this is that shipping can cost as much (sometimes more) than the items themselves - so we budgeted for shipments that grouped items together. The next round of physical rewards has been held up by the instruction manual item that is included in most backers' physical packages (with tshirt, pins, art print, etc). This shipment will include items that can be packed flat, so this one will not include the clay model, though we will look into plans to ship the model and other larger physical items sooner, if possible. As for early access - we are still working on some features that are necessary for the next demo. Since our game is heavily systems-based, and some of these systems have undergone rework (especially level generation), it unfortunately hasn't been possible to offer a stable build that can be played from start to finish. However, we are getting closer to this goal, and as soon as we can offer a new build, we plan on offering more regular builds as we iterate. Hi, Zachary. Since the game is still in development, we do hope to transition to early access at some point. We will keep everyone posted on this when it becomes a possibility. We'll also reach out to you directly to better discuss your several concerns. Hi, CopperBot. Thank you for your take on the situation. We are certainly not attempting to be dishonest, though we understand that is a potential view. And while we are committed to delivering all rewards, if we somehow did decide the game was unable to be delivered as promised, we would release everything that could be made available. Hi, Ben. As part of our customer service process, we speak individually with each backer who expresses dissatisfaction with the project. We understand the desire for a more expedient solution, but we'll be reaching out shortly. Thank you for understanding! Hi, Konitama. I'm sorry if our responses don't sound authentic. There is always a real person on the other end, though I probably do have a stiff writing style! I do attempt to respond to each question or complaint that backers list in their comments, so I'm glad you noticed that I was thorough in my responses. I totally understand that the answers are not satisfactory compared to updates. Hi, Derick. We still plan to fulfill all rewards. We will be in touch to see if we can address your concerns about the rewards for your pledge tier. Thank you! Hi, Splike. We would certainly like to rebuild trust - it's just been a very long road to work through our many development hurdles. We understand that many have forgotten or written off the game, but we are working to get the game back to a point where it will rebuild the original excitement, and deliver on its promises. We know that communication is part of that process, and that backers want to hear from us, and we're truly trying to return the development process to a state where we can get back into a regular update cycle. Hi, Matthew. Thank you for the kind words, and we're glad to have met you at PAX East back in the day! We are definitely still here, working on the game. We hope to eventually fulfill the potential that you saw in the project back then, and are continuing to work to make that possible. Hi, Konitama. Thank you for your thoughts and feedback. There are many ways in which you are not wrong about our mistakes in planning and developing the game. However, we still believe that the best course (for us, and for many backers) is to finish the project, rather than cancel it. We hope that you can understand and support this decision, in spite of your dissatisfaction with the path we may take to accomplish that goal. Hi, David. We are very sorry you are upset that we have not delivered the finished game. However, we are still in development, and have never attempted to commit any form of fraud. All funds from Kickstarter go toward the development of the game - we have never used the funding for any other purpose. Hi, sudoshred. We're sorry to hear that your life has changed in such a way that you are no longer as interested in this project. We would love to retain your support, and we will reach out directly to see if we can address your concerns. And we wish you early congratulations on the second child! Hi, Shariq. Yes, we are trying to get back on an update schedule - it is just taking some time. We apologize for the delay, but you have definitely been heard, and we agree that more frequent smaller updates are something we want to do. A Discord (or Slack) channel is something we've considered, but it would make much more sense when we are closer to a beta state, and can gather feedback and bug reports from backers. Thank you again for your suggestions! Hi, Mike. We are sorry that you feel abandoned. We are still actively working, and have not abandoned the project, though we understand that the lack of updates may leave many backers feeling the same way. We are trying to overcome our challenges and get the project back into a regular update cycle. I'm sure you may be aware, but we plan to release the eventually game on an alternative Android-based system since the Ouya is no longer possible. Hi, CMW. Thank you for your criticism. We do acknowledge that we did not manage the project well, and set goals that were difficult to achieve on a timeline that was impossible to achieve. But we have managed all Kickstarter funds as well as possible, and they have gone directly toward development expenses. We would like to provide a roadmap once a few hurdles have been overcome and we can more accurately predict feature completions, but unfortunately we cannot do so at this time. Hi, Aaron. Thanks for your positive words! Hi, David. We are very sorry to hear that your experience with our project has reflected negatively on Kickstarters as a whole. Our intention was to create a great experience for our backers, and we apologize that our shortcomings in project management and development have created such a negative situation for you. We understand your position and lack of continued interest in the project, though we hope that someday we can restore your confidence in the project. We thank you for backing the campaign, and appreciate your support. Hi, Shaun. Thank you for your thoughts and suggestions, and we agree that it's been far, far too long since we provided even a short update. We appreciate your encouragement, and that you're glad to see that we're still working on the project. We really appreciate the thoughtfulness of your suggestion, and your understanding of our circumstances and intentions to attempt to complete the project. Hi, Aaron. We do still intend to finish the game and deliver rewards to everyone, including the high-level rewards. Some of them are specific to the finished game, so those may obviously take a bit longer than other rewards. Just let us know if you have questions about a specific reward, and we can share our plan for fulfillment. Thanks! Thanks, Trolenz! Hi, Jeritza. We totally understand your frustration, and your question about how funding was utilized. We only asked for $75k to create a game within approximately 6 months, which, in hindsight, was clearly not possible given the scope of the game we promised on Kickstarter. And while the increase in funding allowed us to hire more contractors for art, scripting, etc., we had difficulty navigating engine issues and finishing the programming for certain gameplay features. We have never used any of the Kickstarter funds for personal gain - all funds were used for the development of the game. Obviously the team and contractors have to be paid in order to work on the game, and we had to purchase some computer hardware, but we have always spent money as frugally as possible, and several of us have worked without pay in order to continue making progress on the game. We would obviously like to update our websites at some point (and have the capability to do so), but this would take resources away from the development of the game. If we ever determine that it is impossible to release the game, we may consider open-sourcing the code or releasing the game in an "as-is but moddable" state. However, we are still working hard, and plan to complete the project. We definitely do not want it to look like we abandoned ship, though it's totally understandable that some might think this. We do intend to continue with updates in the future. Hi, Philip. We appreciate your feedback, and you are certainly right in many respects. The plans we had were very flawed. Unfortunately, much of the reason that the game has taken so long are due to issues with the code/engine, rather than an issue of continual refinement or revision. While we are not immune to perfectionism (and the game has indeed suffered from that in some areas), we would have released a less-than-perfect game if it were possible. Our goal has always been and continues to be to release the game, deliver on all Kickstarter obligations (rewards, etc), and ensure that backers are satisfied with the products we produce. We are constantly reassessing our progress, and attempting to improve our output and push the game and other aspects of the project toward release. We thank you (and all backers) for your continued support through these difficulties. Thanks for checking in! We're still developing the game, and though it's been slow going, we continue to work toward release, and plan to continue posting updates in the future. Hi, Jonathan. First, thank you for your understanding and appreciation that we are still supporting the project. We definitely understand the concerns that you and other backers share. We sincerely desire to form a release date or target window, though we are unfortunately still unable to commit to one at this time. We appreciate your patience, and will continue to both work toward completion of the project, and to better (accurately) communicate milestones and release windows when we are better able to do so. Thank you for your support! Hi, CopperBot. We can definitely see the point about trying to release sooner and then patching to add more features/content afterward. It is something we are considering in our plans, and will keep you all updated if such an approach allows us to release something sooner. Thanks! Hi, Chris. Thanks for asking, and for the positive attitude about the project! I can't speak to an ETA on the next update at this moment, but the current work is focused on the dungeon generation system and combat. We're also working on the last couple of reward items that need to be printed so that we can make the first major shipment. Hi, Chris. Thanks for asking, and for the positive attitude about the project! I can't speak to an ETA on the next update at this moment, but the current work is focused on the dungeon generation system and combat. We're also working on the last couple of reward items that need to be printed so that we can make the first major shipment. Hi, Marc. We are definitely going to send the physical rewards and fulfill that aspect of the project. And we can totally understand the opinion that we should cancel at this point, but there are also others that would still like to see the project completed. So as much as the project may seem like a failure, we are still committed to finishing it, both for ourselves and for those that would still like to see it completed. Glad you liked the early build so much, Gorisan! I'm sorry we haven't had a new playable in so long. We are working hard, and making a new playable is the top priority. Thanks for checking in, Zachary! Thank you for the encouragement! Hey, Jordan! We're definitely still alive and kicking! Sorry to see you move on from our general vicinity, but hopefully you're enjoying the change of scenery. We miss being active on Twitter, too - especially tweeting out lore-bits now and then. Working on some things that we hope will be fun to post in the future! Hi, Nick. Thanks for checking in! Definitely see your point about compiling answers to common questions - that will likely be a big part of upcoming updates, as well as our progress toward completion. Here's hoping that friskiness abounds! ;) Hi, Aaron. We are very sorry for the delay. The physical rewards will be shipped - we can guarantee that. We actually have most of the first round produced, but we still need to finalize and print the NES-style instruction manual and the art print before we can start the first shipments. Once these items are complete, we will have everyone update their addresses, and prepare address labels for shipment. Definitely let us know if you have any other questions about reward fulfillment! Hi, Mickaël. Thank you for continuing to support us, in spite of the delays! We definitely hear you on posting more often. We have been trying to put all of our available energy into development, but we know that keeping in touch can be just as important. Thank you for being willing to even read about our difficulties! Hi, Christopher. I'm so sorry that you have MS! We do have an early build available on Humble, which is where any new builds will be released as they are ready. We are definitely working on it! I can send you your Humble key if you can't find the game in your library. Hi, Bob. We're glad that you're still looking forward to the game! We definitely agree that we need to be posting more updates. We're really trying to get that back on track, but development has taken all of our attention recently. Thank you for your patience and encouragement in the meantime! Hi, Mark. The project is not dead - we are still continuing to work on it. We are very sorry that there has not been another playable in quite a while. We do understand the sentiment that some may think we should cancel the project, but we also know that many still want to see the project completed in spite of the many delays. Ultimately, we stand by our commitment to deliver the project and rewards. We hope that in spite of your current dissatisfaction, you might still be interested in playing the game upon its eventual completion. Thank you for your support and feedback! Hi, Kethrian. Unfortunately, we do not have a new alpha/beta version available at this time. Hi, Shariq. Thank you for your comments - we appreciate the suggestions and criticisms. We are sorry that the project looks abandoned, and please be assured that every hour available is going into direct development. I'm interested to hear your thoughts on how the Discord would work for us. Hi, Chris! It definitely has been a while since you helped us out at the PAX East booth. Thanks for sticking with us for so long! Definitely email us your 3D portfolio - we'd be happy to take a look. Of course Delver's only uses 2D art with some minimal 3D trickery, but we're always happy to see what everyone is working on. We might be able to put you in touch with a company that's looking for your skillset. Thanks! Hi, Michael. Our original plan was to ship out the clay figurines with the other larger physical rewards after the game's release, so that we could keep our shipping fees within budget. As you might expect, shipping would be incredibly expensive if everything was shipped individually. However, we've been doing some additional research, and we are hoping to work with a shipping company that may be able to offer some savings through bulk-mailing of large shipments like these. This may open up some additional options to revise our original shiping plan. We're hoping to print the final elements of the first round of shipments soon, so we hope to at least get the first round of smaller items to everyone. (We will obviously ask for updated addresses before the shipment is prepared). But we'll also be looking into options for all items (including the figurines), with the intent to ship some items sooner if the shipping cost lines up with the budget, but we can't make any promises at this time. We'll keep you and everyone posted as the shipment plan progresses. Hi, Touch Gameplay, and thanks for the comments! We do want to do a larger recap/update soon. The idea of listing the parts of the game that are done, versus what is mostly done or still lacking is a great one. We do hope to eventually want to get in contact with the major platform holders again (Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft), and we are very glad to see that the Switch has become a great place for indies. Obviously we will be releasing on our main platforms (PC, Mac, Linux, the iOS/Android) first, but if things go well, we sincerely hope that a console port might be in the cards someday! Thank you again for the well-wishes, and we appreciate your support and positivity! Hi! The game has not yet been released, but if you'd like to play the currently available demo, we can resend your Humble key. We will be in touch via private message shortly to get that key to you. Thanks! Hi, Chris. We are sorry that we've been doing a very poor job updating everyone about our progress. We're happy to answer any questions you have, but we are also working toward updating all of our channels more regularly. We'll keep everyone posted here if we also begin to offer more regular information through social media or another update channel as well. Hi, Mark. You are correct that the game is not on sale at Humble, but we can send you your backer key. We'll be in touch via PM to provide that to you. Thanks! Hi, Kristel. We are very sorry that you have lost so much interest in the project. It sounds like you were never able to play the original demo that was released - we can send you instructions to download that shortly. If you don't play console games, what system were you interested in playing the game on? We are still releasing for PC/Mac/Linux, and later on mobile devices. Hi, Nick. We are currently working on combat actions, character animations for those actions, and the room / dungeon generation system. Unfortunately many aspects of the game are still somewhat rough around the edges, but we are doing our best to work toward a build that we can release to backers. We currently do not have an estimated timeline for release, but we're doing everything we can to keep the project moving forward, and to prepare a new version for backers to play. Hi, Claude. We do still have multiple members on the team. And while the engine did cause many problems, we are now working only on game code. We're sorry that your outlook for the project is not positive, but please let us know if we can do anything to create a more positive experience for you while you wait for us to finish it. Thanks! Hi, Mark. I'm very sorry to hear that our Kickstarter has caused you to lose faith in the platform, and specifically software on Kickstarter. We do promise that you will receive our game, though we understand that the wait has been unbearable. Hi, Marc. While we are continuing to work on the game, you are right that in many senses we have certainly failed to meet deadlines and failed to deliver in the timeframe we expected. However, we do still have the intention to finish the game, and will do everything in our power to bring it to completion. Hi, Aaron. Yes, we are actually putting together a plan to send out the first round of physical rewards within the next few months. This will include the pins, small art print, instruction manual, and tshirts. We will keep you posted when the shipping plan is finalized, and we'll also be sending out an updated survey to make sure that we have accurate shipping information. Hi, Matt. Your frustration is understandable, and we certainly wish that we had planned many aspects of the projects differently. Though we understand that you and others may wish to see the project canceled, there are also many backers that still hope to see the project released. We continue to work toward completion in order to uphold our Kickstarter commitment and to honor the desires of those who do want to see the project completed. Hi, Benjamin. Yes, the project is still alive! We apologize that there has been no news in so long, but we are continuing to work on it, though progress has been slow. Hi, Joshua. We appreciate your feedback about updates, and do apologize that it's been so long. Thank you for your acknowledgment of the fact that we've sent out builds, and we're responsive to comments. @Claude - I'm sorry that you feel that our comments are non-answers. We'll be reaching out to you shortly via PM to see if we can better discuss your concerns. Hey Hardy, Thanks for the input. Simply put, you make a lot of really good points (and obviously know what you are talking about) and it took us way too long to realize some of those things on our own. There is always that nagging desire to "do it all" so to speak, and perfectionism is tough to tamp down, but at the end of the day, grandiose is nothing if you don't ship. You're absolutely spot on there. So the good news is that we've actually made some of the changes (or are in the process of making them) that you mention. Yes, it took us too long to buckle down and make some hard decisions like that, but we strongly believe it is "not too little too late". We are very motivated to ship the game and, at least right now, feel like we are making some good decisions to actually accomplish that even if means murdering some of our darlings. We have been wanting to hit a couple of crucial milestones regarding these things for the next update, which has obviously been a long time coming at this point. We have put ourselves in a tough spot obviously, and it's been a long, slow climb out (and there is still plenty of climbing to go), but as best as we can we are moving forward and optimistic to ship not a masterpiece, but a solid game. Thanks again for your input and the original and continued support. Knowing that people care and want us to succeed is really the driving force as we grind onward. Hi, Greg. To answer your question, our development went far off the original timeline due to a few factors. One was simply poor estimation on our part, in that we believed the game could be accomplished in a much shorter amount of time than would have actually been necessary. But this problem was also compounded by a number of engine issues - since we were building our own engine, this caused many things to take much longer than expected, and several of the game's systems (especially physics) had to be rewritten to avoid massive bugs and so that we could sustain development. So on top of the poor estimation, there was a lot of rework. We also realized several design issues with the method by which we were randomly generating dungeons - it did not fulfill our promise of randomized Zelda-like dungeons, but rather the randomization made every dungeon feel very similar (and boring). So that system also required a lot of additional work, some of which is still underway. We do intend to send out a larger, more comprehensive update on development, especially since (as you mention) we are nearing the anniversary of our originally intended delivery date. It's been a very long road, but we thank you for checking in with us. @Raaxis - While the project is running very late, we still have no intention of canceling the project, even though throwing in the towel would be the much easier path (and a lot less work for us)! But we stand by our commitment to complete what we promised and fulfill our obligations, even though that is the more painful path for us. It saddens us that this is also a painful path for our backers, but we believe that it will be worth it in the end. While some of you might prefer that we cancel the project rather than maintaining unfulfilled hope, we know that many other backers would prefer to maintain that hope and see it eventually released. We definitely understand how painful this is, and hope that those who are less excited can stick with us for the sake of those who are still engaged. We definitely understand if some prefer to remain uninvolved, or unsubscribe from notifications, etc. Hi, MadJo. Sorry things are still so quiet. We've been putting a lot of work into the dungeon generation algorithm, including the programmers and designers, and we hope we can show that off soon. On the art side, we've also been working on some additional mini-boss concepts, which are still in progress. @Michael - The plan has been to send the figurines with some of the other physical rewards in order to combine shipping. So while we may still wait a bit longer to send them, there is no chance they will get lost! We are keeping them quite safe. We're also looking into some better shipping options too, which might improve our plan for getting some items into everyone's hands sooner than later. @David — It seems that you're frustrated with our slow progress, which is completely understandable. We apologize for this, and hope that we can answer any questions you might have regarding development — we'll reach out and message you personally. Thank you. @Gary — Delver's Drop is definitely not dead! Things have been going slowly, but we are still in active development. We most recently put our developers on a new phase of the dungeon generation algorithm, which will expand our previous room generation work into more goal-based dungeon layouts, in order to better achieve the goal of Zelda-esque dungeons (as opposed to simple randomly connected rooms like many other Roguelikes/Roguelites). @Chris — Glad that the shirt is still (barely) holding up! And yes, we can definitely hook you up with a new shirt for your generous help at PAX — we'll probably have a few extras after the rewards go out if anyone wants to buy one. Hi, Jesse. Thank you for your insight — especially your differentiation between backers and customers. We sincerely apologize about the lack of updates, since features are moving along but some aspects of the game are not always video- or screenshot-worthy. We agree that more artwork/concept art would be great, and though our artists have been working a bit on UI and animations, we should have some more enemy concepts and weapons soon. I think more tech demos (screenshots or GIFs) are also just around the corner, so we appreciate that suggestion as well. Hi, Quirken. We still do not have any news on a playable build, though that is always our most important target. Progress is getting faster on the programming front, so we are hoping to have more frequent news / updates soon. We're sorry it's still been slow going, and we haven't had an update in a while. Our latest work has been a much improved camera that can focus on multiple targets (so it will zoom out to show your character and a boss or a 2nd player dynamically), as well as smoother movement that we hope will accommodate those who had motion-sickness issues with earlier builds. Our artists are also working on assets for new zones that have not yet been shown in any updates, so we hope to have more on that soon too! @Amosdragon – Thank you for your support and understanding in spite of our delays, and for continuing to look forward to the potential of our concept, and the game's eventual release. I'd be curious to hear what you found less than satisfactory about other Roguelites, and we hope that we can live up to and exceed your expectations! Hi, Marc. Thanks for checking in. We understand that it may be a surprise for some to find that there hasn't been a build in a very, very long time - and for many others, it may simply be a disappointment or point of frustration. But we hope you can understand that our change in course to fix the engine and implement much better random generation was born out of a desire to live up to our Kickstarter promises, and to deliver a better game to our backers. We are very upset, just as you are, that it has taken so long to work toward a more stable and enjoyable version of the game. However, good things are on the horizon. I can't say exactly when a build will be coming, but I can say it will be a huge improvement over the very basic gameplay that we were able to show in the previous builds. We thank you for your patience through this long wait, and we hope you can believe that the final product will be something you will enjoy. Hi, Jenny. We understand the need to update backer info, especially for those who will be receiving physical items. We will send out a new survey at some point, and Kickstarter has helpfully updated the way that surveys work since our campaign, so it should be very easy to get everyone's shipping address updated. We will keep you posted when we are ready to start shipping things out, so we get your most up-to-date info. Thanks! @Brianna - thank you for your support! We are looking forward to letting you play the game as well! @Matt - We definitely understand the frustration you must be feeling, and apologize that things are taking so long. As you may know, we had a number of large setbacks due to our engine tech, and had to rework several large aspects of the game in order to work toward achieving what we had promised to backers, and to make sure the game would be playable and perform well on all of the promised devices and system specs. We have recently added two more part time programmers who are helping us make progress. Please let us know if you have any other questions. Hi, Alexander. Thanks for your suggestions about providing more regular patch notes / development notes. We apologize that we've been so slow with major updates again for a while, and short patch notes could be a good solution in the near future — especially since our new part-time programmers are trained up, and getting involved in some of the deeper systems for dungeon generation and combat. Hi, Mike. We currently do not have a specific release date. But since you asked about Ouya — since the system is no longer being sold or supported, we will be swapping that platform for one or more similar popular and/or Android based platforms. Examples might include the Amazon Fire platform, Apple TV, NVidia Shield, or Razer Forge TV (which might be the successor to Ouya?). We only will make these porting decisions when the game is closer to release, so that we do not pick another platform which may be phased out, bought out, DOA, or generally a bad fit for our backers / fanbase / market. But the good news is that Android devices are plentiful (and should continue to be for years), and we may be able to support more than one after that initial port has been completed. We hope that helps answer your question! Thanks for your support :) Hi, Russell. Thanks for checking in. Unfortunately we do not yet have a release date, but we are continuing to work on the game as fast as we can. We are also hoping to issue another update soon — sorry for the long delay between them. Hey, Chris! Things are going pretty well. Our newest programming team members are working hard and are now very fluent in the game's systems. This is helping us to collectively make a lot more progress. On the art side we're still working on some monsters and level artwork, so that's mostly business as usual. Hi, Jeritza. Thank you for the encouraging Miyamoto quote; but we are sorry that you have deep concerns with the game. Rest assured that we continue to have the game's original vision and Kickstarter promises in mind, and continue to refer back to our original vision statements for guidance. We will eventually deliver on those commitments, and promise that we will produce a quality game. We'll reach out via PM to see if there are any other questions or concerns we can address. Thank you for being a backer, and happy holidays! @Mickaël — yes indeed! We will have another update about our progress and current developments shortly. Thank you for checking in! @John - Yes, we noticed there is an issue with our hosting provider, and have not had a chance to fix it yet. We will need to do some cleanup, so it may take some time. Thank you for brining it to our attention. @Ben - So sorry for the delay! Yes we will post another update very soon. @Blue-Demon - Thank you for the persistent encouragement! It means a lot, and thank you for your patience. Hi, Claude. We're very sorry that the original schedule was far too optimistic, and that development has been so difficult, causing such a long delay. But we thank you for your patience, and for continuing to follow the project. Hi, Aaron. Development is continuing at a good pace. We are currently working toward some improved collision features so that collision boxes more accurately match everything from fast-moving objects to odd-shaped enemies to weapons with more unique swing-arcs. More details to come soon! Hi, Morse. Yes indeed, we're still kicking! Sorry we did get behind on the update - we're trying to stay on schedule and apologize for the delay. We'll have another post out shortly! Hi, Raaxis. We definitely understand your concern, and our Kickstarter funding amount is not a lot compared to what it costs to run some companies or make some videogames - but it is definitely still a lot of money! We've done a number of things to keep our business expenses limited, and we have made a number of personal and professional sacrifices to ensure that development continues. Feel free to private message us if you are still curious or have other questions about our business practices. Thanks! Hi, Duncan. We definitely understand your concerns, and we are working as hard as we can to get another version of the game into everyone's hands. We'll be in touch shortly to see if we can address your specific concerns. Thank you! Hi, Quirken. We definitely like that way of commutating progress, and it's something that we'd like to start doing again for our backers. It was pretty difficult for a while to break the engine work down into percentages, since so many systems affected other systems. But now that we are moving back into more direct "feature" work, it should be easier to quantify. Thanks for the suggestion! Hi, Chris. Thanks for reaching out! It is true that we currently do not have a release target — but this is not intended to be viewed as a lack of any goals or deadlines. We are trying to work on the game as quickly as we possibly can, but the completion dates for some aspects like the recent engine rework are difficult to predict. In an effort to not set unrealistic expectations for the game or our backers, we have not set a final end date, but have rather been setting internal goals for individual milestones (such as the engine rework, endless drop mode, etc). We are currently revising our goals based on the recent completion of the engine work and the responses to the survey, so that we can focus on the most necessary aspects to complete a successful game that satisfies our backers. So in short — we do operate with internal goals and deadlines, but we are not yet prepared to issue a (potentially unrealistic) release date. Hi, Zesty. We are sorry to hear that you are dissatisfied with the project. We will reach out shortly via private message to see if there are any questions we can answer, or anything we can do to restore your confidence in the project. Thank you! Hi, Hardy. Unfortunately, we currently do not have a release date, but we are continuing to work on making the game the best it can possibly be. We're sorry to hear about your friendship coming to an end - but we hope that the silver lining will be an amazing game for you, and hopefully your copy can be shared with someone else that will enjoy it! Hi, Darewind. We are sorry to hear that you are unhappy with the state of the project - we definitely wish it was done as well. We will be in touch shortly via private message to see if we can answer any of your concerns and restore your confidence in the project. Thank you! Thank you for the info! After all of the required ports are complete, and if the game is successful, we may consider additional ports. It's hard to say which system(s) we might support, since it's so theoretical, and we've had backers request ports to several different systems. But it's great that development kits keep going down in price. Unfortunately, the largest expense is the programming time required to port our engine to each additional system. So we would have to weigh whether that cost would be worth it, based on the potential sales. And depending on the system architecture, some ports may be easier than others... for example a PS4 port is easier than an XBox One port. Being an artist, I'm not as familiar with the architecture of the Switch, but I believe it's much easier to develop than the WiiU or 3DS, so that is good news for devs like us! Hi, Jeritza. We have discussed the platforms previously, but it's buried somewhere in the comments, so I will simply restate it here. I'll also post this information in a future update, since I'm sure many others are wondering too! We are still committed to PC/Mac/Linux for the initial release, as promised. After that, iOS and Android will obviously be the next release goals. After the Android port is complete, Ouya would have been the next port (since it was Android-based). But since it seems that Ouya is no longer viable, we will consider other options. At that time, our goal will be to swap the dead-on-arrival Ouya port for support of one or more Android-based or Android-like devices or platforms. After we begin porting to Android, we will likely allow backers to vote on a short list of these Android-based devices that are still relevant at that time — such as Amazon FireTV, NVidia Shield, or Razer Forge TV (which might be the successor to Ouya?). We only will make these porting decisions when the port development process is ready to begin, so that we do not pick another platform which may be phased out, bought out, DOA, or generally a bad fit for our backers / fanbase / market. But the good news is that Android devices are plentiful (and should continue to be for years), and we may be able to support more than one after that initial port has been completed. I hope that helps! Feel free to let us know if you have any other questions! ...we address all of your concerns. I don't know how the end of that sentence got cut off! Hi, Brianna. There is a bit more information about reward shipping in the previous update (<url>#3 for us -- partially because we started with Windows and OSX support, but also because we had a relative lack of experience there as well. Despite that, Linux has always been part of the original "Triad" for our release platforms. To be honest, there are a lot of questions marks beyond those 3 platforms, but there are not with Linux. Now a bit more into the weeds... Way back in the first year of development the original plan was to outsource the Linux version - in fact, we talked to a couple of developers and got a rough bid from one. But of course, we ended up being really dissatisfied with the game as it stood and realized we were way off course and yeah, we began this really long convoluted dev cycle. At that point, the immediate Linux plans were put on the back burner - we were struggling mightily with just the game's development so additional platforms were shelved for the time being. Fast forward to the present: we've been doing a lot of engine and general tech related work and all of that has been done with Linux support in mind - including testing a few specific things (filesystem stuff, etc.) We still have to port the renderer and windowing code which is a substantial amount of work, but we also did some experiments this past year, including perhaps using SDL2 as the underlying system for the Linux version. Anyway, Linux has been on the backburner for sure but it hasn't been absent in our minds at all and in general there is a very strong desire to start getting Linux builds out sooner than later but there is no real timeline on when we can do that. Anyway, hopefully that sort of clarifies both where we are coming from and where we are going regarding Linux. By all means, if you have other/more questions please let us know and we will do our best to answer them! Thanks for your support :) And the update is live! Thank you again for all of your patience, everyone. Please hit us up via private message with any major questions, comments, or complaints, and we'll be happy to respond! Hi, Aaron. We are finalizing our edits for the year-end update on our progress and status, and should be sending it later tonight. Thanks for checking in! Hi, Michael. We are currently working on a big end-of-the-year update that should get everyone up to speed. More on that soon! I'll also reach out via private message to see if you have any other specific questions we can answer for you. Thanks! Hi, HaikenEdge. We will be in touch shortly through the private messaging system, so that we can address your concerns with the project. Thank you! Hi, Gomisan. Thank you for your feedback, and perspective on sharing our progress better. We were really wanting to share more experimental updates with backers earlier this year, but the current issue is that with Humble as our only build distribution platform, we can only have one build available. This means that we typically want this build to be as stable as possible... and unfortunately, that stable build is very (veeeery) old at this point. As we mentioned in some previous updates, we were working on a way to distribute builds through our website, but the friend of the team who was helping us out with the website update (and build distribution system) had some life changes and was no longer able to help complete that project. However, we now do have a new part-time developer who may be able to pick up where he left off. If and when we are able to work out build distribution, we would post much more regular updates, even if those updates are buggy or limited in features. We know not everyone would want to play such a build, but some of you do - which is why we are hoping to do this on our own site, giving us the ability to explain what people are getting into. I know that's a lot of information, much of which will be coming in our next update. I apologize again for dropping out of communication. We are truly trying to get back on a regular schedule, with structured communication, and have made some changes within our team's workload and schedule in an effort to make this viable. We do want to re-instill our backers' ownership and pride in the project, and I'm glad there are backers like you who are still interested in participating in our process of development. Thank you! Hi, Craig. I'm sorry that you have lost interest - I hope that we might be able to re-instill some of your lost confidence, and we will also be in contact with you shortly to see if we can address your concerns. Thank you for your patience! Hi, Sergio. I will be in contact with you via private message shortly, to see if we can address any of your concerns about the game. Thank you! Just to clarify, there are more than 25 of them to be shipped - otherwise it would be fairly inexpensive. But we could not afford to ship every item individually (and it would be hard to decide which items to ship individually, since that would show favoritism to higher tiers), so the plan was to bundle them into groups. Hi, Michael. Based on our shipment plan, the figurines are scheduled to go out after the game is finished, since everyone at that tier will also be receiving several other items in a larger box, including the boxed copy of the game. There is a chance we may consider revising our shipment plan so that people can get items sooner, but we will have to see what we can manage with the allocated budget. The figurines themselves are done, but it would just be a large additional expense to ship them by themselves, if that makes sense. I hope that helps! @peterS — haha, is that a suggestion? :) Just kidding, our plan to is stay in the ancient lands of C++11 regardless of any cool newness that may come out. @Aaron Warkworth — The game is very much still under development, albeit painfully slow development. All of the humble builds released were pre-beta, so still very early. We have made a lot of progress since then (fully randomized rooms/levels, improved combat, new art, etc), but we're still trying to stitch that progress into a more cohesive, release-able alpha build for all of you. Hi, Michael. We definitely understand all of your concerns. We have indeed over-promised and under-delivered, especially with respect to the schedule. However, it is our hope that the added development time will ultimately allow us to over-deliver in terms of quality -- and it is our belief that the promise of quality is what ultimately led the majority of our backers to support the project. But we understand that others may have pledged based more on our delivery timeline, and many pledged due to an interest in our genre, though some tastes may have changed over the course of time. We do apologize for any degree to which our under-delivery or delayed delivery may have led you to regret your support. But please know that the game is still in development. All of you, our backers, are not going to see your pledges evaporate. We are a team that (while not necessary timely) does fulfill our promises and obligations. You and all other backers will eventually receive all promised rewards, the most important of which is the best game we can possibly make. @Glenn - thank you for the kind words. We are very grateful to know that backers like you are still supporting us. We know it can be discouraging for everyone, and we understand the lack of patience that many feel. But it always improves our week to hear encouraging feedback like yours. @Glenn - Thank you. You're very right. I think we begin to feel like releasing an update is an admission of our failures rather than a celebration of our accomplishments. You make a good point about showing artwork and other forms of progress. We were hoping that the livestreams would provide the steady source of information and art progress, but that hasn't been the case. Thank you for the encouragement and suggestions. We're going to be discussing as a team, to talk about some ways to provide shorter, but interesting updates, and will keep you all posted soon. Hi, ddbelyea. Thanks for getting in touch! I'm very sorry that we've gone so long without an update, both on Kickstarter and our website. We have been in the process of updating the website, but we want to make sure we don’t take time away from development.. On the game itself, we’ve been working toward a major engine revision which (now nearly finished) makes physics checks literally several thousand times more efficient. This means that the game will run MUCH better on some low-end devices. We also eliminated a huge amount of physics bugs in the process, which were causing the gameplay to be broken in certain situations. However, this large revisions has unfortunately meant that we've had very little to show or talk about for some time. Due to this, and honestly just being a bit discouraged that we've been working so hard yet are still behind, is why we've been waiting until we are able to announce the completion of the engine revision before we post another big update. We should have been sending smaller updates in the meantime, and we're sorry that we dropped off the radar again. But all of that to say that the game is definitely not dead. We just wish that we had better news to share more often. But the good news I can share with you is that we're over the hump in terms of engine work, and will be able to start showing gameplay improvements and feature completions again soon. This will be the focus of our next update. In the meantime, we still stream twice per month on twitch.tv/pixelscopic, every first and third Thursday at 6:30pm CST. We usually on on concept art and characters / enemies / weapons, etc. while on the stream. We tweet out a reminder on our streaming days, if you want to follow us on Twitter @delversdrop and/or @pixelscopic. Thank you for checking in on us, and definitely message us if you have any other questions or feedback, and I'll be happy to respond. — The Pixelscopic Team Hi, Jeritza. Thanks for asking! We are currently focused on the PC/Mac/Linux versions, and will be porting to iOS/Android after that, so that we make sure we fulfill all of the Kickstarter objectives. Since we had promised an Ouya port, but that is no longer as viable, we will also target one or more Android or iOS-based variants next, such as Amazon FireTV or Apple TV, etc. After those goals are achieved and all of our Kickstarter rewards are fulfilled, we may begin to consider ports to additional platforms. This largely depends upon how well the game sells, since we would want to fund the port out of revenue generated by the game itself. If additional ports seem like a wise decision, we will begin the process of deciding which platforms have the best benefit-to-cost ratio — in other words, which ports are the most cost-effective for us in terms of development time, which also have high demand from our backers, and high potential sales? This question may be easier to answer after Nintendo/Sony/Microsoft all fully unveil the final versions of their newest hardware in the coming months. But ultimately, all of this depends upon how Delver's Drop sells upon its final release. If additional ports become a reality, we will likely turn to you all (our backers) for opinions on which platforms you would prefer for a port. It will definitely be an exciting day if and when we can consider it! Thanks as always for your comment! Hi, Peter. Thank you for the encouraging words — we really appreciate it. And you are right, we have been taking a long time to finish the next update. We were very close to a nice breakthrough on the engine, but hit a few more setbacks, so we have had less to report while we are finishing that fix. But we will have an update ready soon, and are continuing the art livestreams every 1st and 3rd Thursday of the month, at twitch.tv/pixelscopic. More info coming soon! Hi, Tom. I'm sorry that you did not receive your postcard! We will get another one sent out to you right away. I'll send you a private message to confirm your address in just a moment. Thank you! Hi, @Kaedryl. Yes, we are still on track to deliver all physical (and non-physical) rewards, though obviously everything is running very late. We are trying to wrap up one more item for the first round of physical rewards, and when that is done we will start mailing them. But many of the higher-tier rewards (such as the boxed copy of the game) are dependent on finishing the game first, so those may take a bit longer. I'll send you a direct message to discuss your "likeness" reward, and see if you have any other questions. Thanks for your generosity and support! Hi, Kristel. We did send out postcards (I hope you received yours?) but we are still working on completing the remaining rewards. We have some of them ready, but are still working toward completing some of them (depending on your reward tier). I'll get in touch with you via private message to see if we have your current address, or if you have any other questions. Thanks! Hi, Damien. Yes, we definitely still plan to put the game on Steam! We have talked about Early Access, but it seems that many games gain a negative reputation if they are released too soon on Early Access. We think that it would be best to release an early access version when the game is closer to 80-90% complete, with a lot of polish. Of course, our backers can always get an early version of the game via Humble. We know that many backers would also like a version on Steam, which we hope to make possible, even before a public Early Access version is available. The game is technically Steam-compatible, but we will need to make a massive "private key request" from Steam. We actually submitted a request a while ago, but we are still waiting on a response, so we may have to try again. We will keep everyone posted if/when we are closer to having a Steam version ready for backers. I hope that helps! Hi, Robbie. We are very sorry for any dissatisfaction that has led you to ask about refunds. We will be getting in contact with you shortly via direct message to see if we can address your concerns with the game. Thank you! Hi, Josh. Unfortunately no, we have not released the game yet, and that's why it's hard to find on retailers. Since you are a backer, you probably received a Humble code to download the Alpha through Humble, though this would only be in your library and not on the Humble Store. I'll send you a link to your Humble Key just in case. Thanks! Sure thing, Austin! We definitely want to make sure that everyone has a prompt answer to their questions and comments :) And we are still working hard on the build, but we guarantee it will be worth the wait when it arrives. Hi, Jeff. Thank you for the encouragement! We definitely understand the varying points of view on our game and its delays, and we appreciate your enthusiastic input, as well as respect (and hope to improve) less positive outlooks. So while we are striving to renew confidence in those who are dissatisfied with our progress, it is a huge boost to our morale when we hear from people like you, who are looking forward to the game even more as time goes on. It's also encouraging to hear that you still view our gameplay and game world as interesting and exciting in the midst of similar games like BoI, Nuclear Throne, etc — since the Action RPG / Roguelike scene has exploded since we began our journey. And it’s great to know that in spite of increased competition, we still have something to offer both in theme/story and hopefully also in gameplay and overall quality. Thanks again, and we hope to only increase your interest and excede your expectations as we finish the game! — The Pixelscopic Team Hi, Rik. Yes, the project is still alive. We hope you’ve been able to catch up on the last few updates, though we apologize that we have been issuing them after about 6 weeks instead of exactly one month. We are trying to get back on a regular schedule with them, but between all of the other work we do, weekly livestreams, and general business management, it’s just been hard to keep up. We also apologize that the Delver’s Drop (and Pixelscopic) websites have not been updated in a long time. (A friend of the team has been working on a new site for us, but it is WIP). As you can imagine, working on the game takes priority over website updates, and a lot of aspects of our PR tend to fall by the wayside. As for the status of our progress: The one very concrete news item worth mentioning is that we are finally done with the major engine (physics) rework that was holding up game features. We are currently working on some remaining physics bug fixes and a few gameplay updates in preparation for a new build. More information on this will be available in our next update, which should be making its way to your inbox(es) within the next week. As for Ouya support: We’ve mentioned that it will most likely be supplemented or replaced by the support of a similar Android-based device. When we are closer to launch (or perhaps shortly after the PC/Mac/Linux launch), we will begin porting to Android, and at that time, we will likely allow all backers to vote on a short list of Android-based devices, such as Amazon FireTV, NVidia Shield, or Razer Forge TV (which might be the successor to Ouya???). We will make the decision on the voting list when the Android porting process begins, so that we do not pick another platform which may be phased out / bought out / dead on arrival. But the good news is that Android devices are plentiful, and we may be able to support more than one. However, after reading the rest of your comments, it seems as though few further replies we might give would be satisfactory for you. I wish this were not the case, but unfortunately you might find that we would be repeating things we have already said in updates or below in the comments. If indeed this type of game has lost your interest, or is no longer to your tastes, then even if we could release the game today, we may not be able to satisfy the full breadth your concerns. We definitely understand that tastes change, the industry changes, and people lose interest in a product like ours, the more time passes — and we certainly do not fault anyone for deciding they have moved on from what we offer. The best and only way we can make good on our promises is first (and most obviously) to finish the game. And secondly, we are attempting to make a game timeless, which will be just as fun and beautiful twenty years from now as it would have been if we had released it on our original timeline. We realize that the delays have led to much dissatisfaction, and we apologize immensely. But the truth is that this very long extended wait for Delver’s Drop is in service of making it into a game that is worth the wait, because it will be a lasting joy rather than a disposable fragment of entertainment generated by the Indie-dev and crowdfunding-boom of the 2010’s. We will be contacting you shortly through private message to see if there are any particular points about the game or gameplay, or more technical aspects of our development status (and delays) that you would like to discuss, since the full replies might flood this message queue :) Thank you all (anyone who is reading) for your patience, support, and encouragement. We appreciate all of you, and your concerns, and look forward to discussing more with each of you. In the meantime, please look forward to our next update. — The Pixelscopic Team Hi, Rik. Thank you for checking in on our status. The short answer is that the project is still alive, and we are still working on it. We will address the rest of your concerns in a full response as soon as possible. Thanks for your patience, since we would like to take the time to respond as thoroughly as possible. Yes, sorry we've been taking longer than usual. But we do have an update written up - just need to add a few more relevant bits of info and some images before it's ready for publication. Thanks for checking in! Thank you for waiting for our full reply (and sorry that it is rather lengthy). We may include much of this in one of our Kickstarter Updates in the near future. But until then, we wanted to make sure that we addressed all of the concerns here in the comments. On Our Development Plan & Schedule Visibility: We have gotten a lot of momentum back recently, but it has still been a much slower process than it ideally would be. We know the wait is frustrating for all of you — it is equally (or even more) painful for us. In general, development has been quite difficult. We have to be extremely resourceful and scrappy, and have had to look for inventive solutions to keep everything moving smoothly. We are not subscribing to an "until it’s done" philosophy, and we are trying to avoid that kind of working mentality. However, there are some features whose timeline are hard to predict, especially in programming. And there are some hard-to-schedule features that simply have to be done (completely done) before we can update the schedule with confidence. So we do have a plan, and a very clear plan — but unfortunately, some aspects of that plan have taken and may continue to take more time than we had originally thought. And though we’re now making better headway, we’ve been hesitant to provide schedule updates on a regular basis. And as a small team that does all of its own PR (or the next best thing to it), it’s hard to know how often and when is best to update a public schedule, especially when we’ve been wrong in the past. Consequently, we are even more hesitant to provide another schedule update until the current round of features is complete. We want to avoid a situation where we put up a public schedule only to have to change it again the next month because something didn’t go as planned. More concrete scheduling, and build releases: We're currently aiming to get a number of mission-critical features implemented before the end of January, leading to a solid and playable build for backers early in 2016. Once we get there, we should be able to better map out remaining features — and hopefully provide a more complete schedule to backers. But until we finally demolish the current programming features that are blocking a solid build, attempting to nail down a firm release date would be wading into murky territory indeed. We do understand that many backers like yourself are not interested in beta / early access builds, and that is totally valid. Some backers are happy with beta builds, some are content to wait until it’s done, and others simply want it to be done now. So in the meantime, we are trying to work toward fun, playable builds for backers, and make them more readily available on our website. This is a bit of a stop-gap (as any beta build would be), but it is the best solution we have short of a 100% complete game. The next goal will be to create a stable and cohesive version of one mode of the game, so that players like yourself have something that is “release ready” with only minor updates and content additions coming afterward. We’re hoping that this tiered approach will begin to satisfy more and more backers, though we’ve been waiting to fully announce this plan until we have 100% firm, not-gonna-change dates. On the content in our Kickstarter updates: Our goal for updates since March has been to provide news on our progress on code and art or content. We would be willing to explain more about what’s technically going on behind the scenes (exactly what’s happening in the game code and engine, etc), but that’s not really what most backers would like to read each month. And while updates will often contain some information about when features or builds are expected, we don’t want to create a cycle of hope and disappointment with play-by-play updates to the schedule each month. We have been waiting until we have a firm hand-hold on the current build before we post a new public schedule. It has probably been too long of a wait for many of you, and we apologize. We are cautious in the sense that we try to only provide information when we know it is accurate, and while this may seem like we are holding back information, we are actually trying to avoid a situation where updates are actually a disservice to our customers. On Retaining Backers, and Refund Requests: It is our desire to retain all backers, and always address everyone’s concerns as we are best able. Kickstarter does not officially offer refunds, though their policy suggests that project creators offer refunds if and when they feel unable to complete the project. However, we do still plan to finish Delver’s Drop. So we are left with a bit of a quandary when someone asks for a refund, and therefore we have a direct conversation with them about their concerns and the reasons for their request. It turns out that many backers are unaware that a build is currently available on Humble, or they may have missed some information in our updates. Our goal is to always attempt to alleviate concerns and meet the needs of customers while they wait for the game to be released, rather than harming the game’s quality and our ability to work toward release (since this is the ultimate result of trying to provide refunds). Why we may respond to some comments via a private message: I understand your concern with how we respond to comments — that it has seemed in some instances like we are putting the burden of customer service on the user. And we agree that this would be a poor practice. We attempt to address all public comments immediately (even if we are out of the office), even though we may not be able to fully respond to the request right at that moment. We would not want to leave a customer service comment overnight (even if it goes up after business hours), so we try to at least respond with a quick reply to make sure no one thinks we are ignoring the concern. What is not apparent (publically) is that I always try to reply to these comments myself within 24 hours via a private message, rather than waiting for the commentor to do so. And in the case of the comment to which you were referring, I did follow up with the backer myself rather than waiting for them to contact us. We will be changing our wording to make this more clear to all backers in the future — that we do (and always will) follow up those concerns ourselves by contacting the individual via private message. Ultimately, we want everyone to know that: we are responsive; full customer service is available via private message or email; you can always contact us via PM or email if we somehow make a mistake or forget to respond to you directly; and we want to simultaneously let everyone else know that while we are attempting to immediately meet the customer service concern, we will not be addressing that concern directly in the public comments — but rather via private message. I hope that I’ve adequately addressed all of your questions and concerns. If not, I’m happy to explain further. We are truly sorry for the difficulty and frustration that our development process is causing all of you. All I can promise for now is that we are trying desperately to make amends, make real progress, and (we really really hope) release something great in the coming year. — Ryan Baker, Co-Owner / Vision Director Hi, @iamuhura. We appreciate your honest critique of our current situation, and customer service practices. We are deeply sorry that you and many other backers are dissatisfied with our performance, and the lateness of the project — and especially that our project's lateness has damaged your interest and confidence in Kickstarter. We will be in touch (here in the comments) soon with a more complete response. I just wanted to make sure we followed up immediately, but it may be tomorrow before we respond to each of your concerns in full. Thank you for your patience — both for our delayed response and for the project itself. Hi, Kenny. Yes, you should have received a Humble key a while back. But if you do not see it in your Humble Library, shoot us a private message and we will resend your key. Thanks! Hi, James. Feel free to send us a direct message if you have questions about the lateness of the game. We will try to address your concerns in any way we can. Thank you! Hi, @Hepburn3D. Steam is still in the plans, yes. We have our Steam account setup, and we've improved our build method so that we can much more quickly / easily make builds for different platforms, since it used to be an all-day affair. Now that things are streamlined, I'm hoping that we can distribute to Steam once the upcoming build is available. It may not be the same day as Humble, but hopefully soon after. Thanks! @Mark — Yes, the game is quite far behind. We are very sorry for all of the delays, changes, and mistakes we've made along the way. If you look back to Update #41 we explain the why's and how's and when's of the project and its lengthy development time. But we are still working hard, and it is definitely not our goal to keep the game or your money captive — we are doing everything we possibly can to finish the project, and make good on all that we've promised. If you have any specific concerns or questions, please send us a direct message. Thanks! Hi, Mohsin. We will be sending you a private message in hopes that we can renew your interest and alleviate your concerns with the project. Thanks! Hi, Michael. Given your reward tier, some of your items will be shipping soon, while others will ship after the game has been completed. We currently have the tshirts, stickers, pins all ready to go, and are working to finish the game manual before the first round of rewards goes out. We are hoping to get these out quite soon... sorry again for the delays. Your sculpted rogue figurine and cloth map will come with the final DVD boxed copy, once the game is fully finished / released. Hope that helps! @Sylvia — I'll send you a private message with your info. Thanks! @Bob - Thanks for the compliments! We have plenty of other ideas for games that we may pursue someday in the future, but Delver's Drop is definitely our focus until it's completed :) @Jonathan - We are still planning to do Ouya. However, if the platform disappears or something else catastrophic happens, we would likely try to support an alternative Android-based device. We were planning on Ouya specifically because 1) it was pretty popular when we were doing our Kickstarter, and 2) it is a very easy port once we have the Android version finished. So based on time taken to port, Ouya would be *MUCH* quicker than PSVita. However, we do agree that a Vita port (or 3DS, etc) would be very cool. Their system architectures just make them more difficult and time-consuming to port our engine, so we can't promise anything... though we would love to see more platforms as much as anyone :) @James - Sorry for our delay in responding since you caught us right around the weekend. We will get back to you via private message to address your concerns. Thanks! @T Tahere - no problem! Thank you for sticking around! By the way, Baker will be doing an art livestream today at 3pm CST! (We are in daylight savings time, FYI) @Splike — Thanks! As for Steam Cloud Sync, we would love to do it, but we haven't looked into the logistics in a while. It might be something we would have to add after launch, but it's definitely on my wishlist. I jump back and forth between PC and Mac, and syncing saves can be a godsend. Update sent! And just before midnight... sorry again for the delays. We look forward to your responses, good and bad. Feel free to send us direct messages with your concerns at <email>! Thanks for the feedback. It does seem like the general response is that everyone would like to be more in the loop, even if there is not a lot of significant news. I'm finishing the next update as we speak (hopefully will go out tomorrow). We are also putting together a plan for doing regular updates every 2-3 weeks, which should hopefully be packed with some fun info. When you stare at your own work so long, you tend to forget that what seems like a grind to you may actually be interesting to others. But suffice it to say that starting this week, we will update more often and more regularly. Thank you all for your feedback, and for the criticism too. We are listening, and will be making changes for the better. Just a heads up to everyone, our website has been down part of today, but we are working with our web host to get it back online. Sorry for any inconvenience! Yes, I definitely agree that our PR has not been on its A-game. And yes, we should probably have sent an update a while ago. We've just been of the philosophy that most people would rather see emails in their inbox about progress than apologies, so we've tried to be active here in the comments and on our forums. But as you point out, a true update is necessary. So I will first apologize here, and promise again that a more full apology is coming soon, along with some other good news as well :) @ Jamison Imhoff: We are working on both the next update, and wrapping up the final item that has to go in the first round of reward mailers. We are really sorry for the delays, and lack of communication about them. We have been waiting for some good news to solidify so we don't bombard everyone with unnecessary updates, but it has definitely been too long. In short - an update is coming and rewards are coming. We'll have more on that very soon. @Austen - Delver's Drop is definitely not dead! We have definitely gone way past the original schedule, and we're very sorry for the delays. We should have another update to post soon, but wanted to make sure we some really relevant news was forthcoming, rather than waste everyone's inbox space. Stay tuned! Hi, Raaxis. Yes, we are still working on the game. We will be sending out an update soon to give a better idea of the state of development. Hi, Spike. Sorry for the seeming silence! We are prepping another update which should be out very soon. For more regular discussion, I'd like to encourage everyone to check out forums.pixelscopic.com, where we've been talking about the elemental system among other topics! :) Thanks for your support! Thanks, RIchard! We are looking forward to it being a great year as well :) Hope you have all had a great holiday season so far! Hi, Ryan. I'm sorry you didn't receive your postcard yet. If you could send us a private message with your address, I will check it against our records and send you another one. As for the other rewards, we are still working on those. We will be sending out one batch very soon, and another one after the game is finished. Let use know if we can help with anything else! Thanks for the encouragement, Sylvain! We really appreciate your support. We have not yet — but we will be doing a Steam version (possibly through Early Access) at some point soon-ish. We might also be able to do a version just for backers, but we'll have to look into how that would work. But I definitely understand the desire to get it on Steam! Hi, Michael. I'm sorry that you're unhappy with where the project is at. We would definitely like for it to be farther along as well. Unfortunately some of the features have just taken longer to finish, or were not as fun as we thought necessary, and have therefore required rework. We have however tried to keep all of our Kickstarter backers in the loop with updates every so often, and have updated the game on Humble very recently. We will be sending another update soon, after we finish up a few more items that will be newsworthy — we're trying not to spam everyone too much. Please send us a private message if you have specific concerns or suggestions you'd like to discuss. Thanks! Hey, guys sorry for the delay in response. The iOS version will not be released until after the PC/Mac/Linux versions are out. We will have to do UI and control/input changes specifically for touch screens which will take a bit of time. So expect it probably a month or two after the desktop versions. @SCott Lafary We are working on a new build and a big update for this month - in the meantime, you can catch one of our two weekly devstreams (Wed @ 3 pm CST, Fri @ 4 pm CST) for glimpses of in progress work as well as a chance for live Q&A. Thanks for your patience and support! Hey David, you'll want to use this link to get the code through the Humble Store. <url>#new @Nigel Lee - I would also be interested to know which characters class(es) you feel are too slow, and if you are talking only about movement speed or also about attacking, etc. Hope to hear from you on the forums! Note - the board linked in the previous comment is Alpha-only board, so you may not be able to access it if you aren't an Alpha Backer, or haven't made a forum account as an Alpha Backer. A few people have commented on the speed of characters - it seems that some people like it, but it's too slow for others. We can easily modify the characters' stats for acceleration and top speed, and will continue to balance the game as we move forward. We are definitely taking your comments (and the comments of others) into consideration. If you'd like to participate in some further in-depth discussion, feel free to hop on our forums (specifically this board: <url>#58. Not too bad! We probably need to release some more gameplay footage and get some additional press in order to get closer to the top 10 by release, but that should be no problem... we have lots of things in mind to roll out in the coming months :) It's coming soon, I promise! I'm trying to wrap up the character art (this is Baker writing). Might be a bit after midnight, but it is super close! Sorry for the delay. We're sending out a Kickstarter update today with info on forums and characters :) @David - yes, for anyone backing at $30+, you get 2 copies on all 6 platforms, and all of the exclusive content for both copies. You also get 2 open beta keys, but only ONE early closed alpha / closed beta key. Hope that clears it up? Sorry for the confusion! Seriously, my brain is addled and I cannot spell or proof-read today. Going to try to recoup from the trip / germs by eating chicken noodle soup, taking throat lozenges, and playing Borderlands 2 for a few hours! Glad they enjoyed the game! And yesh, Coby did a knock out job on the Plague Rats. Just need to add a better poisonous explosion effect now. Ghosts are quite a bit better, too (though still kind of hard in a good way). Next step - just making more enemies in general! @EOPE42 — Yes, the commenters on Kotaku sort of went on a tangent without understanding fully how the game will work. But you know how it goes in comments... sadly not everyone does their homework. If people have something totally incorrect we might drop in and respond to clarify, but since those comments were more of a critique of the idea, we are just going to work our hardest to prove them wrong and make the levels excellent :) And someone (Kotaku user "Rastervision") had already mentioned that Endless Drop isn't the full game mode, so it's nice that there are people out there (especially many of you!) will defend Delver's Drop or make sure people know the true details. Please just remember to be polite (like that user was) if you want to correct anyone on another site's comments. :D Thanks for having our back! • Black spaces in the video — those are pits and they need a *lot* of visual work. They will eventually have descending wall faces so you can tell they go down into the ground, and probably spikes at the bottom to differentiate them from the Drop (so you know the Drop is fine to jump down, but pits = death). We will also have inner barriers or "sub walls" at some point, which will also look more 3D. • Telling the story – there will be some NPC dialog, some character internal monolog (what the Delver characters are thinking), and some text objects (books, etc) that you find. We may also have some voice work, still deciding on that and checking the budget. • And good call on Desktop Dungeons. It's a great game, and our 100-room labyrinth will sort of work like an action version of this game (not exactly, but it is one of our inspirations). Go play it everyone! <url>"Bootleg Session" from PAX Prime 2011 (between "Live" Episodes #20 and 21) on Ryan's iPhone. Audio quality is pretty bad, but it was nice to preserve it nonetheless! More recommendations: not actually Retronauts, but some of the same people from 1UP — Active Time Babble episodes 5 on the definition of "RPGs", ep. 9 on Roguelikes, and then ep. 15 on Action RPGs. Huge influences on Delver's Drop here! <url>"endless" (like reusing the last theme forever after room 200 or something). We'll figure something out :) @Bothered - yep! They will all be dungeon-ish (interior castle areas), but many will be more colorful, have more light, or actually look more like part of a castle / temple / courtyard / sewer / ancient ruin. Hi, @Jeritza. Right now we're only showing one of the nine planned zones. We will also be adding a lot more variety to the level you're currently seeing, which is the Jail level. We'll also have new enemies, dungeon/puzzle mechanics, and story elements in each new zone. You will also be able to exit the dungeon temporarily and explore a small area of the mountainside, but most of the gameplay will take place in interior dungeons - though some may be taken over by nature, or have more sunlight, etc. We will have quite a lot of variety, so we hope that satisfies what you're looking for! Guess what? DELVER'S DROP IS NOW #99 on STEAM GREENLIGHT! This is very good news, since we're in the top 100, and top 10% of games on Greenlight's voting system. Thanks for all of your support! If you haven't voted yet: <url>• The best day was last Monday, right after the Kotaku and YouTube playthroughs went live - $11,526 • Yesterday was our 2nd best day overall at $10,204. • So far today is our 3rd best day at $10,164... but obviously it will become our 2nd best day with another $41. --------------------- So what does all that mean? Well we still have several hours to go, and pledges seem to be rushing in. And against all odds (and honestly we didn't think it would happen), we *might* just maybe hit the $150k stretch goal. It would take almost double the pledges we've received so far today, so it's hard to say if that's a crazy expectation or not. But with the addition of Paypal pledges, which are over $500 so far... we will very likely hit it before the Paypal offer has ended on March 27. So keep spreading the word! @ddbelyea - I'm around all the time unless I'm sleeping :D Yes, the $50 tier includes 2 copies, both with all the exclusives. The only thing that it doesn't have 2 keys for is the Closed Alpha/Beta (but it has 2 for the open beta later). @Blue-demon - Really wish we had some more art and content to give out right now! Ryan has been working on some fancier concept art that could be used for wallpaper, but it will probably be after PAX when it's finished. And yeah, the special last-week sale idea is cool. Wish we would have planned something like that earlier. We were trying to come up with some ideas for new tiers/bonuses, so that's why we added the $30 extra copy tier... not very special I know, but a lot of people were asking for it. Hopefully we can just do more cool stuff for backers later after the campaign ends, out of the goodness of our hearts :D ---------------------- @finallyanime - I think a lot of people used the 3V card - <url>"heart" - I think that's one of the best compliments we could get :) ----------------------------------- @Mark Conticchio - Exclusive items will be found in shops or sometimes found in the dungeon. There will be too many of them to start out with all of them in your inventory. But we will make some of them easy to buy right away. Others you may have to work a little bit to unlock, but they will definitely not be super-hidden-ultra-secret-mega-hard-to-find objects. We will probably put a lot of them in the Jail Armory, right where you start the game. @John Harfouche - I have played Grandia, but apparently not far enough to know about the Icarian Wings reference :D I really *really* want to go back and finish it someday. I have a huge soft spot for 32-bit RPGs in that era in between SNES and true/nicer 3D that would come about on the PS2/3/360... though they are often a bit hard to go back to. @Mohammed - Yes, Paypal contributions will count toward Stretch Goals. We will update the graphic on the Kickstarter page (and our site) to show everyone how they are progressing. As for distribution - we are already on Steam Greenlight ( <url>"spaghetti mess"... which is a mess second only to that left by seppuku. @Christian Lara - no problem, and thank you! Alpha is for $25 backers and up. We weren't able to add it to the sidebar, unfortunately, but you can see it in our rewards list inside the page, and the rewards chart. Alpha will become available in late June, and we hope to have the forums up by then. We will continue to post updates here on Kickstarter. We will supplement this with information on our delversdrop.com website and its newsletter - though the newsletter will probably shift toward major announcements only. We will probably post at least one Kickstarter update per month (don't want to spam everyone too often now that the campaign is over), so our site or blog will be the main source for people who want more granular updates. We will be working on a forum - mainly for the Alpha/Beta access. Not sure when it will be available, it may take some time to set up. But we will likely add a "public" area for general information and questions, and/or anyone who is not part of the alpha/beta. @VacantPsalm - Yes, we have considered a lot of options for multiplayer, though I think yours is a slightly new angle. (And yes, Northernlion was playing "Endless Drop" mode, which we are also showing at PAX). The 4-player Co-Op horde mode will be playable with only 2 players, and will function a bit like Endless Drop. You will just have more waves of enemies, and larger arenas to play through before you "drop" to the next area. There probably won't be as many rooms as in Endless Drop, but we think this might satisfy a similar niche. As for just directly adding co-op to Endless Drop (or making a 2P variant) - I'm still concerned that the switch puzzles may become easier with 2 players though. But you are right, that adding co-op to Endless Drop would be easier and less broken than adding it to the full campaign. Thanks for the suggestion! No promises, but we do discuss all of these ideas internally and really heavily consider them. ------------ @Jeritza and Goris - We will definitely say that the original Zelda is... frustrating to those who haven't played it before, and was definitely frustrating to us as kids. On the other hand, Coby is a HUGE fan of Zelda 2, while that one confused Baker even more. So we ended up truly falling in love with LttP and Link's Awakening. But regardless, we're glad that @Jeritza sees Delver's Drop as the sweet spot of Action RPGs! $130,000 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Stretch goal for 2-player local co-op Companion mode unlocked! @ William Gibson - Are you *the* William Gibson? I'm guessing not, but if so, thank you for Neuromancer! Contributing names - I think I wrote about this somewhere else, but don't remember if it was in comments or a direct message. Basically we will be thinking about ways to distinguish names - could include your hometown or a nickname of your choosing, like "William the left-handed" or similar. Either that or we'll ask people to consider making common names into more interesting ones like "Williamus." Okay that's not very interesting but you see what I mean :) @Faux Shizzle - sometimes we need tough critics :) thanks for being reasonable and helpful. @Faux Shizzle - thanks for all of your thoughts and pointing out that we should make this more clear to backers before pledges are locked. We are sending an update later today with several news items in it, and will include information about the exclusives so that everyone is aware. @Bothered - yes, everything will be local as it currently stands. We wish we had internal tech to do online, but sadly we aren't there yet. It really sounds like everyone would be happy with a solution that involves Kickstarter backers with the content being able to share it with their friends. The content on the friends' game would be similar but not identical - something would be slightly different to keep the true Kickstarter content exclusive (and cooler) than the shared content. We would be open to hear thoughts to the contrary if anyone does not approve of this idea - please drop us a direct message so we can discuss. ----------- We really do not intend to sweep this under the rug. The only reasons we have not made an official update with the exact plan are: 1. Any form of sharing will require a backend system that we will have to (most likely) develop ourselves. We are not sure exactly how this will work yet, and it will take a lot of planning. We do not want to announce a sharing system that we can't feasibly execute, so we are waiting until the plan is 100% final (and 100% technically possible). 2. We also have only heard from a select number of backers like yourselves who comment and send us direct messages. We would like to hear from a wider variety of backers before we make a final decision on how to solve this issue. We are completely committed to being as transparent as possible. But right now, without having every detail of the plan in place, we are not comfortable making promises we may not be able to deliver on... meaning we would have to then take a step back and present a new plan. That would be even worse PR, unfortunately. :( ------------ Something else to note: We are about to add a Paypal option on our site as an expansion of the Kickstarter campaign for those who could not back due to not having a credit card or Amazon account. They will technically be able to get the exclusive content in a way that is not via Kickstarter, but we consider this a part of the same campaign, and since everything will be the same price we hope that people will understand that we are just trying to open this option up to more people who were locked out of Kickstarter before. Yes, you can do combinations of keyboard and gamepads, or just multiple gamepads. @Boo - that's awesome! Thank you for coming up with the idea to do that for us! ---------------------------- @Blue-demon - thanks for the encouragement, and we're glad you can see it from our point of view. ---------------------------- @John and Christopher - glad to have you! Thanks for backing. @James - YES! We will support mods. Please see the last section of this update: <url>#chart-daily). No reason not to try though! One other thing though: We will be launching our Paypal page tomorrow, and any contributions through it will also count toward Stretch Goals. Sorry this didn't go up over the weekend as promised - too much to do! ------------------------- @Faux Shizzle - Yes, we're aware of the Reddit threads and such where some are unhappy with our handling of "exclusive" content through the Kickstarter. We viewed it as a way to reward backers, but we now see the unfortunate side effect that those outside of Kickstarter will feel that they are excluded from this content - and this wasn't our original intention. We have a lot of things to take care of to finish the Kickstarter and sort out what happens next, so it may take some time - but we WILL find a solution that is satisfactory for as many people as possible. We do want to fulfill our promises and keep the Kickstarter items/class "exclusive" in some way since otherwise that would cheat our backers. The best idea so far (suggested by someone here on Kickstarter) would be to allow backers who have the exclusive content to share it with others, making it a win-win. It's still exclusive *through* the Kickstarter campaign, and backers get to contribute to the rest of the community by providing bonuses to others. This is all subject to technical feasibility, but we do want to find a solution. If you have ideas of your own, please PM us! @adrians93 - While I like that idea... I don't think we'll be doing any raffles or random give-aways, since that kind of cheats the people who are paying for things like alpha access. So for a really lame answer... if you come to PAX East you can play the pre-alpha :D I know that doesn't really make it better, sorry. ---------------------------------------- @ryan shoemake - please email us at <email> with any fanart. We may not be able to do anything with it for a few months, but I will figure something out eventually. Thanks! @adrianps93 - Haha, thanks! We hope to at least satisfy those who enjoy BoI, but be unique from it :) To your questions: ----------------------- -As VacantPsalm asked (quote): 3. If we provide a name that turns out to already be on the list, do we get a redo or is it waisted? --- I must have missed this question somewhere? We haven't thought about this, but it is a good consideration. We might allow people to add a lastname or nickname or something to differentiate. We'll work it out somehow. ----------------------- -I think you considered a permadeth feature, I think it can improve replayability, giving a more hardcore experience, so that if you get stuck because of not having bombs or something (like you have mentioned below) then you are screwed and you cant trigger that suicide feature. Maybe it could be one of the achievements, for true hardcore gaming experience xP ---- yes, we are adding a permadeath option (aka Hardcore Mode) that you can turn on in the options menu. It will probably have several achievements tied specifically to that mode. ----------------------- -Please do the labyrinth 100 rooms when possible, want it so badly!! :D --- We'll think about it ;) If the game does well enough after release, we may do further expansions/DLC/etc to cover some of the other stretch goal features... or maybe we'll come up with other cool features, who knows? @Nerd Kingdom - We may have some Pixelscopic hoodies / shirts to sell at PAX Prime. In the campaign, they aren't meant to be a high-dollar exclusive so much as a "thank you" to the people who are really pitching in to support us and promote us through those tiers. @Doomspeaker - We would be really glad to have you back the Kickstarter - but just in case the card does not arrive in time, we will probably be launching our Paypal option today or tomorrow. Kickstarter is preferred, but we do want to make Paypal available as soon as possible. And thanks for the promotion! We really appreciate you putting the word out. Let us know if there are any interesting forum threads etc. we should check out to see what people are saying. As for their questions: -Is your logo a nod to zelda? - Kind of... I think we did it to match the style of some other UI/design elements originally, and then realized it was kind of a nod to Zelda, and it stuck. -The paralax scroll of the walls is nice, did you ever think about adding that to the drop that leads to the next room as well? - We will be adding parallax / 3D type effects to all pits at some point. Right now the walls are handled automatically through a system we built, but pits would have to be set up manually, so we just kept it simple for the time being. Final game will definitely have 3D-looking / parallaxing pits. -Don't-range based classes have an advantage over melee-based ones (especially when it comes to puzzles) - They could have an advantage in some cases, but melee fighter may have advantages in other circumstances. For instance, an arrow may not trigger some switches, which have to be hit with a block or melee, etc. And remembering that any class can pick up and use a limited-use version of the other class's weapons, the rogue can shoot arrows (as long as they have some in their inventory), and a bow-weiding class can also use a sword (though it will break after a few hits). We are also thinking about advantages / disadvantages of classes for the newly added 4-player mode, and will be balancing things like range, attack speed, and possibly damage dealt by each class to make sure they are all evenly balanced. -Can you get stuck in story mode? - We will be doing testing/QA to try to avoid any situations like that. But at the same time, if you use up all of your bombs, yet you need bombs to get through the dungeon, well... tough luck :) Kind of like Spelunky, there is the possibility of screwing yourself. But we are going to have a "suicide booth" mechanic where you can restart the level with a new character while retaining more items/progress than you would otherwise. You just have to deal with an extra nasty Undelver (undead skeleton class) if you use this option. -Can darkness affect monsters? - We are working on some AI for bats and other monsters to avoid fire or lights. We may make other types of AI that are attracted to it. I think that's what the question is asking, but if not I can give other details. @Sebastian - no worries :) glad you found your answer(s)! I think you have to connect it to Facebook... not sure if there is a way around that. I want to say I tried to do it once and didn't find a solution. Anyone else know? @EOPE42 and Four Shadow Games — thanks for the compliments! We're collectively blushing. We will probably announce something livestream-ish today :) @EVERYONE - Yes, thank you so much for helping us reach the stretch goal! We are just as excited to develop it as you are to play it! Let's keep pushing toward $130k, I think we can make it :) ---------------------------------------------------- @finallyanime - thanks for the article! giving you a shout out now on Twitter ---------------------------------------------------- @Christian Lara - unfortunately no comic con for us :( Maybe next year? We will be at PAX East/Prime this year, but that's all for us this time around. ---------------------------------------------------- @KW - we would really really like to see some Delver's cosplay! Send pics to <email> if you do! As for more character art - yes, I am working on that tonight, hope to show it very soon! ---------------------------------------------------- @Sebastian Helton - Looks like Blue-Demon linked you to our ideas already :) But one other thing to know, is that all classes will have a special ability that must be recharged before you can activate it again. Some of these will be more magically oriented, either defensive or offensive; some will be physical attack oriented (dealing with the character's weapon), and others may be another skill or perk. So in a lot of ways, yes, we will have classes that are balanced across a range of melee / magic / skill / debuff / etc. Especially now that we have 4-player versus Deathmatch as a mode, we will be making each class play very differently yet be balanced for fun and evenly-matched combat. Let me know if this is answering your questions fully or if you meant something else :) @Nathan - yes, Paypal backing will count toward Stretch Goals! YES! 4-PLAYER MODE STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED! @anthony - thanks! @Happy Badger - thank you very much! Where are you located? @Kenny - unfortunately that probably won't be possible. Right now our Android tech is incomplete, which is why the iOS/Android/Ouya launch will occur later in February 2014. This will give us much more time to finish porting the engine and do a full QA/testing run on those systems. As of right now, we don't yet have an Ouya dev kit, and I'm not sure if we would be able to do a "closed" alpha/beta on the platform (only making it available to some players) - it would be a more in-depth discussion with the people at Ouya. So for right now... I think that it's unfortunately rather unlikely we could change the current course. Sorry I don't have better news :( @Adam — you will give us a name, let's say "Erlandsson" since that is an awesome last name. Whenever a new character is spawned, let's say if you choose to play as a Gladiator, that character will given a name out of our pool of names (both from backers and that we write into the game), and that name appears in the upper left corner. Then whenever you have dialog or when you die, "Erlandsson" might get spliced into that text - so "Erlandsson the Gladiator succumbed to the deathly swamp spores. How unfortunate." And the second question, relevant to all 3 of you @adam, @anthony, @Trong: Any stretch goals that we do not hit in this campaign are up for consideration as DLC or expansions later. No guarantees though! It depends on how well the game does on release. If we got really close to a stretch goal... well I mean if we're $5 away, we will probably go ahead and do it :D BUT! As @Trong suggested, all Paypal donations that occur on our site will ALSO count toward stretch goals. We will keep the chart updated to include the total amount between Kickstarter and Paypal (basically think of it as an extension / expansion of the Kickstarter campaign for anyone who didn't have a credit card or for other reasons can only use paypal). @anthony - Yes. By default they will be automatic AI. You will simply enable the 2nd player control in the options (or possibly just by plugging in a controller). We'll work out the details later as we develop it :D Sorry everyone, took a little break this evening! Catch up on comments: @Blue-Demon: Summon class (or summoning creatures) — This is almost exactly how the companions / familiars will work at the $130k stretch goal. Even if we don't reach the goal, we will probably still have some summonable phantom creatures, and you may have to have an item equipped or something like that before you can summon. We are also going to offer the Shaman as one of the voting classes, and this class will get summon bonuses and the ability to somewhat control or change the AI of enemies — sort of making the enemies work for them in a limited fashion. They may not need the required items to do summons. @finallyanime - as for giant final fantasy style summons, not sure about that one (lots of art cost), but we'll think about it :D @Ben Paul: Character voting — As soon as the campaign wraps up and the dust settles, we will start working on the backer surveys. We will send out one survey where everyone $25 and up will get to pick characters out of 6 choices. We'll have to see what the survey capabilities are, but we will either have you vote for one, or vote for your 3 top picks. Then we will tally these and take the top 3 overall, and these will become the other 3 classes in the game, for a total of 6. The Kickstarter exclusive class (#7) will probably be decided by us, just FYI. The final #8 class will be selected by our $2000 backer. This should all happen within about a week of the Kickstarter ending and we'll try to make an announcement before PAX. @Andrew / Anthony - yes, anthony is correct! You can play on both devices. You can also install the PC/Mac/Linux version on multiple machines if you need to. @finallyanime : Kickstarters - nothing wrong with that, one of our guys is thinking about backing Torment! @Roland - we haven't gotten around to releasing that information yet. Sorry! Basically each pack will contain a set of weapons - at least one for each class, and a set of several additional usable items. Each pack will contain more (in quantity) and more interesting and unique items than the last one. Hope that helps! @finallyanime / Blue-demon - I think we're all on the same page :D @Blue-demon - we definitely don't want to be gold-diggers! We're much more the "earn your stripes, pay your own way" types. That's another reason we'd like to see if the game does really well, and then continue adding to the game through the revenue it's generating, creating a sustainable development cycle for us, and rewarding the community with more content/modes as long as we have enough of a fan base to support it. All things to think about after all of the currently promised versions/features are released! @finallyanime - some people have suggested something along those lines. Though right now I think we all feel like one Kickstarter was enough work for one lifetime! :D There is of course the possibility that if the game does really well after release, we might keep making more content / modes / expansions / etc for the game, which *could maybe someday possibly* include online multiplayer. Honestly, we have no idea right now. So no promises, but yeah, these are all things floating around in our brains :) @Boo - NOPE! You get 2 copies automatically! @Dire Birdbrain - glad we could be the one to break down your Kickstarter abstinence! :D @Adam - thank you for signing up just for our game! It's really amazing and humbling to know that you and others are so excited about Delver's Drop. The Paypal option will be going up on our site this weekend. We'll post an update and links about it when it's live. @Blue-demon, yes your calculation is accurate. Good call! We seem to be having a slower day today, but hopefully your prediction holds true. Campaigns also typically get a small flood of backers right at the end, maybe people who forgot to back it and want to get in before the deadline, etc. But we will still need everyone's help promoting the campaign's final days to attain the extra $23k needed... it's quite a bit of money, even though we're making good progress! :) @VacantPsalm - yes, it does. 2 copies = 2 copies of any digital in-game items that go with your tier. Awesome, thank you! Glad we could sweeten the deal, and we're hoping for $130, too! Even if not, $115 looks very very likely :) Thanks Dale! @Maken - no online co-op. Please read the comments immediately below for more info. @Jeritza is correct — you would connect several controllers to one computer (or OUYA system) and play there together. We would probably not use split-screen. We would just zoom out slightly so that all 4 players would be seen on screen at once. The 4-player arenas will be either large rooms, or 2-3 connected "rooms" with large passageways between them - in other words these will not be full dungeons, but rather large arena rooms. @finallyanime — while getting Greenlit and releasing on Steam would help us to develop a community for people to play together and largely solves the lobby issue, we would still have to put a lot of time / effort / money into developing the actual network code that allows the game to run in sync on multiple machines. This is even harder since our game has physics, and some pretty intense calculations that have to run perfectly (and identically) on multiple machines at once. This is a harder technical problem than it may seem. So that is why we are currently limited to local-only multiplayer. We will continue to evaluate the possibility of doing online multiplayer as we move forward, and there is a chance that if the game is successful enough it will make sense for us to add it someday. However, we can't promise anything right now. @Kymus - us too! And yes, more exposure did the trick. @FOMA - Glad to have you in the industry! Just checked out your website - very nice! @James - we are supporting mods, so you can definitely create your own rooms and (possibly/probably) full maps! @Christian - yes, a lot of people have requested co-op, and we would love to do it if it were possible. But this would almost have to be a full second game for us to develop. We would have to add mechanics like split screen or some kind of rubber banding, would have to design all new rooms, especially for puzzles so that they are tailored to 2 players, make a new story that fits 2 players at once... all things that would become an investment that would be way too big for us to consider right now. We might think about something like this much later if the game is very successful after release, but no promises :) @Ross - yes! EpicNameBro sent us a lot of backers. Really great coverage! @Bothered - welcome! Glad to have you :) Awesome, thank you! That is really cool :) Someone even pointed it out on Twitter, so props to you! @Sue - not sure about add ons. We've talked about it, but we're not sure how to organize or price them yet. We may not find a good solution, but we'll let everyone know if we do! Yes, big thanks indeed! And at this point, we are knocking on the door of $100k, so that will be even one more class! Yes, as soon as the campaign is over and all pledges are confirmed, we will talk to that awesome person and find out which class they want to add! Quick PSA for you: There is a really rad looking game about to end on Kickstarter, called Race the Sun: <url>"manage my pledge" page! It's unfortunately kind of easy to accidentally up your pledge and then not select the right reward tier. @Jeritza and Doomspeaker - Yes indeed, it is our very distant quarter-million stretch goal :D But even if we don't hit that one (kind of a long shot), we will re-evaluate consoles after the game is released. Basically if it does well enough, it might be worth porting our engine and releasing on a console. It seems like people have (so far) been most interested in WiiU and Vita, though we've had some requests for XBLA and 3DS, too. What would be your preferences? And.... LINUX STRETCH GOAL ACHIEVED! Way to go everyone! We'll send an update about this a bit later! @SRVN - yes, everyone at $15 and up gets a full Ouya copy. Here's an example tweet: I'm helping indie RPG game @DelversDrop reach its #Linux Stretch Goal on #Kickstarter! only $2000 to go - <url>• Talk about specific Stretch Goals on Twitter using @Pixelscopic - mention Linux at $85k and the Expansion at $100k, and how we're getting close to these goals. • Post on Reddit! Especially think about mentioning the $85k Linux goal. • Post on Facebook, comment on Greenlight, or comment on any article / Youtube preview we've been featured on. These may seem like small things, but they help a lot! Anyone who isn't a backer may not know about the Stretch Goals, so let's get the word out! @finallyanime - please just send us a private message about it. We have gotten a few messages about cross-promotion, and now that we've met the goal we may consider doing a promotional update to help some other campaigns out. Not sure when we would do it, but we'll think about it. @Doomspeaker - great idea! I've seen a lot of other campaigns do that, so we'll try to do something similar (and maybe more interesting looking) today or tomorrow. @anthony - thanks! we've gotten some great coverage from them. @Chris - we hope so too! It looks like it might just be possible. @Lemon - please check out the main Kickstarter page, there is a full section down below the rewards list, toward the bottom of the page. We were thinking about keeping it a secret until the game was released, but might as well leak a few things now through Kickstarter... Give our backers some early hints and sneak peaks and all that ;) @finallyanime - we wanted to keep some of the characters fairly androgynous, and also not over-sexualize any of them. We may make both male and female versions of all classes at some point (no promises) in which case we would find ways to further differentiate the m/f rogues from each other. @vacantpsalm - we will try to do them in both genders, just not sure if we'll have time... we'll do some estimates and see what we can come up with. And yes, good catch on the live Northernlion show! We should have mentioned that in our update. THANK YOU EVERYONE!!!!! @VacantPsalm - we'd like to do all classes in both genders... and it's been a secret to everyone, but the Rogue is a girl! (or at least she is in the concept art I'm working on right now :) And... here we are. GOAL ACHIEVED!!!!!! HUGE THANKS to everyone, we're sending out an update momentarily! Thanks everyone! We're really excited right now... so excited, we can't even focus on working on the game, and are just watching the numbers tick upward toward 75k! But don't worry, we won't party too much... there is too much to do, and we're so excited that Kickstarter is about to make it all possible. @Kyle - Yes, actually good catch. That should be "character name". Unfortunately we can't change it now (sidebar stuff can't be edited, Kickstarter rules), but hopefully people will understand? :) Hey Michael! Thanks for the compliments :) @finallyanime - no, the class unlocked at $100k would be a different class from the exclusive Kickstarter class. So at $100k we would have 7 classes total. @Matthew - it looks like that might be possible! We're watching the numbers intently, ready to throw a little office party the moment it ticks over the $75k mark! @r33hash - we might be done sending demos to the press and streamers for now, but if you have any good ideas, please send us a direct message! We will at least put them on our press list for when we send out information in the future. Thanks! @Erikson - we hope to provide Steam keys at some point, but until the Greenlight occurs and we talk to Valve more directly, we just can't promise anything for sure. We will do our best though! As for the slippery feel - this occurs based on the physics system, and depends on the character or object's mass, friction, etc. We are still working on tuning these parameters, so some things seem a bit too slippery, and some are maybe a little to "heavy" or stiff. We are definitely working on this, and one of our immediate goals is to finish standardizing the physics system and parameters, and tighten up all of the movement and interactions. So yes, it is something that's very present in our minds! We hope to make it extremely tight and responsive. @Blue-demon - totally understandable! We'll definitely think about your request. @Blue-demon - oh, and one other thing. There is always the chance that if the game does well after release, we may have the opportunity to continue development and make some of those Stretch Goal items / modes as expansions to the game. Since they would not part of the Kickstarter campaign, they might have to be purchased separately (they would be free to backers if the stretch goals are met). But since all of that is so far off, we can't commit to doing them, or what they would cost (if anything), and when they would be available. @Blue-demon - we've already promised the Linux goal pretty explicitely both on Kickstarter and other places, so that one will have to stay at $85k. And the next goal after that is really our "true" idea for the game, with another class and zone that were in our original design docs but we had to cut in order to keep the scope reasonable. We might consider shuffling some goals around if we pass $75k though, if it looks like we can meet those goals. So I would really encourage our users to help promote the game in this next week so we can hopefully hit a few more of the stretch goals like the ones you mention. :) @Tom - unfortunately it got a little confusing because we added the $50 tier later, so we couldn't correct the $60/80 tiers to mention that they didn't include everything in the $50. Sorry for any confusion, but glad we cleared it up! :) @finallyanime - no worries, we keep looking at the number thinking we're reading it wrong too! Such a big jump, it's kind of crazy. @John - thanks! $10k seems pretty manageable :) Whoops, sorry we had 2 team members post at the same time! :) @finallyanime - we actually have jumped from about $50k at midnight on friday, to $65k at noon on Sunday - so about $15k in the last day and a half :D Let's keep pushing toward the stretch goals! Thanks for all the congratulations everyone! We're really excited to be getting so close :) @Steve - I'm going to try to put the livestream up on youtube somehow. But I believe you can still watch it on Justin.tv here: <url>"all previous rewards" includes every reward that comes before it, such as the examples you mention. The only exceptions are that that $60 and $80 tiers do not include everything in the $50 tier, but include most of it (they do include everything $40 and below). Other than that though, you get everything that was listed previously. Thanks for the positive comments; we're getting pretty excited and deeply appreciate the big second push that has occurred! @Tom Dagan: Yes, the $300 tier gets everything from the $200 tier and the $160 tier and so on all the way down. @Matthew - we will probably do another livestream next weekend, or possibly on our final day (March 12). Glad you're looking forward to it! @anthony - yes! We're super happy. Today was our 2nd best day overall, only $241 shy of beating out our first day of the campaign for total pledges. And we're excited to see what happens this next week! @finallyanime - awesome! Link us to your site if you post something about the game! We're keeping a list of everything that gets posted. @Fishfreek: It is not public :) We sent it to a handful of press outlets and a few youtube personalities, and that's it. Very happy you are excited to play, but we're simply not to the point of a wide public release yet. @Jess: We do not have a prototype of the cloth map yet, sorry :( @finallyanime - You will see the weapon or shield change in the character's hands whenever you equip something new (or take damage to the shield). We will look into adding other items like armor or an accessory that is visible, but most likely it would cost too much time/money to get all of those items to look right and animate properly. You have to draw them from all 8 angles of the character rotation, so it gets pretty time consuming. @Doomspeaker - yes, we've had a lot of people voice concerns over exclusivity. I think we might have talked back and forth with some people in the first update if you want to read that, but in summary — we will most likely add a way for a Kickstarter backer to send or otherwise unlock the exclusive items and content in their friends' games, allowing these items to proliferate. We need to look into how that would be technically feasible. If we can't do this, we may release some kind of timed DLS with the character and items (or something very similar so Kickstarter is still "exclusive" but people can play as a class with the same abilities). So Kickstarter backers might have a special insignia on their character's cape, while other people just have a plain cape... something like that. We're not 100% sure yet, but we will work it out so that everyone is satisfied! @finallyanime #3 - Yes! there will be randomization for all of the items. It won't be as complex as Diablo or Borderlands, but you'll be able to find different styles of your character's weapon that have unique (and slightly randomized) parameters, like range, sweep, elemental effects, all that good stuff. As for Phantasy Start red boxes - we will have some extra special treasure chests that contain better gear. So in summary - yes, epic loot! Thanks guys! Just so you know, we are contacting some major sites - of course it's hard to know who will cover us or when. Please keep hitting up twitter with @DelversDrop mentions and share our campaign on Facebook! It may not seem like much, but it is a HUGE help! Thanks for everyone's support today, and a special thanks to all of the new backers! @Christopher Campbell - We're really glad that Ouya support sold you on the game! We've also been in touch with the Cryamore team, and are really excited about their game as well. Hoping a lot of people support their game and ours, to get more interesting action RPGs out there! As for cloud saves - in a perfect world we would 100% support it, but as you said, it's a complicated (and expensive) problem. Our goal someday, maybe even for Delver's, to offer cross-platform saves and support as many devices as possible, even ones we do not currently have listed in this campaign. Could take a while, but that's the plan. We would love for you to be a walking billboard for us! I'll even design you a sandwich board to wear :) Or you know just make a Delver's tshirt or something. @Anthony - thanks for the link! @Paul and Christopher R - Thanks for the encouragement and for spreading the word! We really appreciate it. We've been (very slowly) working on an update that will give more information on all the digital and physical goods. There are just a lot of things to post updates on, and it's taking a while. We apologize for the delays. But in short - each pack will be a set of unique weapons with unique properties. There will be at least one weapon available for each of the 5 base classes, and a handful of unique items (bombs etc). Each tier will have one more set of these weapons/items, with higher tiers having both more items and more interesting / unique / powerful items. Hope that clears it up a bit! @Michael - We are prepping an update or two for this week... watch your inbox! @SRVN - We would like to answer a "tentative yes" to cloud or cross-platform saving. In other words, one of our highly-prioritized technical goals is to support cloud saving, but whether that is via Steam Cloud or in conjunction with another service or our own technology is still being determined. So... we sure hope so :) @Quirken - I think that the key wording we are trying to uphold is in the $60 tier: "Exclusive In-Game Playable Character Class. ONLY AVAILABLE THROUGH KICKSTARTER!" And the $50 tier says that it includes the $60 tier's class. As I mentioned, we're still considering options for how to fairly include people outside of the $50 tier, whether through a timed release, paid DLC, sharing with friends, or something else. We are also considering your idea of the exclusive class being a variant, but at the same time we do want this class to be somewhat special, and worth the upgrade to $50 since the Kickstarter backers are directly helping to fund the development of this class. @Sami — thanks for your thoughts. I think we do have a few features that will alleviate some of these concerns: • In the last update we mentioned an option for "Hardcore" mode, so that if you turn this on in your options screen, you can play with 100% permadeath (exactly like a Roguelike). It sounds like this is the mode you would perfer! • Leveling up your class (and upgrading your gear) will be designed to give you more *flexibility* - not necessarily make you more powerful. You will not gain more HP or attack power this way. So you can't grind out a high-level character and then breeze through the game. You can grind for slightly more flexible / customized abilities, but it will not make the game much easier. • The player will be penalized quite a bit for death: 1) loses all items, 2) the level they are on re-randomizes, and has to be replayed, 3) an undead version of that character is also generated on the level, increasing its difficulty. And 4) if the player dies too many times without completing a level (maybe 10 times, we're not sure yet) then the Drop is locked out and they have to replay a re-randomized version of the previous level... meaning that they just *lost* progress. You could theoretically backslide all the way to the first dungeon if you keep dying, meaning that kamikaze play styles really won't help. As for the Kickstarter exclusive class - we are looking into a way for backers to share this class with their friends, or at least some way for non-Kickstarter backers to unlock it. But we do want to keep the class "exclusive" in some sense, so that's why we're looking into ways for backers to share them with friends rather than making it 100% publicly available (since that would falsify our reward tier's description). Hope that all helps! @Michael - thanks so much! We're glad to hear that our game and Kickstarter can contribute to the gaming landscape in a positive way. @Sami - I believe we are indeed trying to attain a game that is, as you stated, "Zelda-esque take on the roguelike." So I would be interested to know what points in the updates have turned you off. We will have some traps and monster hordes, but those will be infrequent, and used for surprise and variety - not as a way to try to insta-kill the player needlessly. And yes, right now the game is so early it's even hard for us to know how difficult it will be in the end, but we're already balancing difficulty as we design new rooms, based on watching players. We recently showed the game at a local convention, and made a lot of observations about what was difficult, easy, or confusing. Why don't you send us a direct message with some of your thoughts on how the game design doesn't seem to be living up to your interests, or your initial impression of the game? @Kyle - Yeah, we're pretty interested in multiplayer as well. We're working on some additional press coverage to get more backers and push us into some of those stretch goals! @Paul - thanks for you pledge and encouragement! Yes, this class will only be available to backers at $50 and above (it's included in every tier over $50), and is being developed especially for Kickstarter. There have been some concerns over exclusivity, and we have been taking suggestions to remedy this. After the game is launched, we may at some point allow people to "share" this exclusive class with their friends, but the technical method of doing this (or if it will be possible at all) has not yet been determined. Cool, thanks for the info! I think I would be more comfortable with the tiled version as well - I think you have to be a true old-school / experienced roguelike player to roll with the ASCII versions these days... but then again I'm our artist/animator (Ryan Baker), so I kinda need some pretties now and then :) And yes, we are trying to get into better blogging habits. I'd like to do a series of our takes on various inspirations or Action RPGs from the past and how they may have contributed to the genre or to Delver's Drop. We'll definitely check it out then. I've been sort of looking for my next gaming fix / inspiration / research / diversion... Would you recommend the regular download, or with tile graphics, etc? I read about a browser version, too. Just wondering what the differences are. @Wexmajor - I actually haven't played Stone Soup, but I am familiar with it. We're really trying to create a mix of gameplay mechanics (from many different inspirational sources) that seem to fit the experience we are shooting for. So there is probably some Stone Soup in there, one way or another :) Well to be honest we worry sometimes, too. But we're working on some updates with more concept art and bells and whistles, and lining up additional press coverage. All part of the plan! Campaigns usually slow down around the middle and get an additional boost at the end, so we're actually slightly ahead of the curve with 19 days to go. So fear not, but tell all of your friends about the game, and help us drum up some additional support! @Steve, thanks! We weren't able to take footage at Vision Con, but we expect to show more gameplay footage and some other details soon! We hope it will be a nice surprise :) Also, there's an Update with extended gameplay details coming tonight! Stay tuned. No promises, but we might be able to do something like a "mostly physical goods" tier, though it would probably have to be in the $70-100+ range. Hardcover books will still be tough to do, since it would be by special request only, and we might have to ask backers who want one to add a decent bit on to their pledge to cover the production costs. Hey everyone, please comment if you're interested in any of these ideas! We've had some requests for hardcover books, but they are quite a bit more expensive to produce than the soft cover books (about 3x as expensive!). If you have any ideas for an additional tier, and we have enough interest, we might consider adding something for either a hardcover book or just another tier that includes the artbook. Let us know what you think or if you have other ideas! Haha, awesome! Thanks for supporting us, both at Vision Con and through Kickstarter :) Hopefully we'll see you around at other local events! For the playable build, we will provide a download link or email (still determining distribution methods), and we will give you forum access - probably using your Kickstarter username and a password of your choosing. We'll give everyone more details as we get closer to the Alpha/Beta dates. Thanks! Hi, Max. You can get the art book at the $120 tier (or a digital version at the $25 tier). Thanks everyone! Creeping right up toward 50% tonight! Woot! Thanks :) It's been almost 11 days, or 1/3 of the campaign so far... Let's hope that's only 1/3 of the backers we'll get by the end! 3,000 would be a pretty awesome goal. @TheChoseOne @anthony We'll be making some more information available this week the press and media folks; hopefully that will drive some more exposure. @SommerEngineering: anthony is correct. There will be some outside areas but there will not be an overworld. @Are Nybakk: Giving out two copies is an interesting idea. We shall discuss. @Quirken: The game supports multiple save profiles and copy/erasing, yes. @Pete Cavenas @randomcitizenx: Correct, the Ouya is based on Android but has its own SDK. From what I understand, once your game runs on Android, getting it to run on the Ouya is not a terribly difficult affair, fortunately. Obviously we must have an Android version ready first, but the Ouya port shouldn't take too much longer after that. @Steve Adamo: Yes, we are getting so close to halfway there and it's very exciting for us! We have some updates coming this week and some other things that will hopefully get the attention of some more media :) @foxfirerage @randomcitizenx @Pete Cavenas Re: Ouya: this is still an area we need to investigate more fully, as the Android portion of our technology chain is the least mature. It's more about working it into the logistics than any real technical hurdle at the moment - but any platform will have some unique hurdles to overcome. That said... barring some sort of major difference we aren't aware of we're more than fine rolling Delver's Drop out for the Ouya, it just probably won't be for initial release. @foxfirerage We have no plans to require an internet connection to play the game currently and we can't think of a reason this would change. For leveling, we're implementing a system that is split along the lines of the character you are currently playing and the class it belongs to. As you play, classes will accumulate ranks/skills that will apply anytime you start a character of that class. These skills will apply utility perks to each class's characters, which we're still in the process of designing. The individual character you're playing at any given time will progress through the dungeons finding more useful items as per your Zelda example. Regarding look customization, it's not anything we specifically have planned right now, but this may be part of the class level/ranks system we implement or something that we leave open to being modded. Thanks for your questions! @Bradson: Oops, sorry :( Sleep deprivation and all that :) This morning we headed over to VisionCon and got our [very tiny] booth set up. Over the next couple of days we'll post some photos and maybe a video. On demo is a very early/prototype of Endless Drop mode, hopefully people enjoy it and come wandering this way! @Brandson - thanks for all the suggestions, we'll definitely take them under consideration. And we're glad you're excited about Companion mode :) tell your friends so we can hit that stretch goal! Yes, I agree that the co-star mode in Mario Galaxy is more like a "slightly involved spectator" - but we are envisioning our Companion mode as much more than that. The companions *will* be actively involved in combat - they can cause damage, debuff enemies, buff or heal the player... basically any option you can think of except for puzzle interaction. And we really like your idea of hot swapping! Of course the players could just trade the controller, but adding some kind of automatic function would be perfect to keep both players involved. Thanks for your feedback! Yes! Items will definitely factor into puzzles and your ability to navigate the dungeon, in ways similar to Zelda. We will be creating algorithms that will generate levels with the items necessary to explore them, or a way to purchase the items you need. In other words, you'll never get stuck! Think of our co-op "Companion Mode" to be like an improved version of "Co-Star" mode in Mario Galaxy... or as if a 2nd player could control the familiars in Symphony of the Night. Rather than seeing it as a gimped version of full 2nd player co-op, we view it as its own interesting feature. Even if we had true 2-player co-op, we would still want to include Companion Mode as a unique addition to the genre! @Quirken - a lot of people have been asking for a true 2-player co-op campaign. We'd love to do it someday, but the truth is that we would have to basically develop a totally different game. Every room would have to be developed for 2 players - enemy counts, room space, puzzle setups... it would all have to change. The example I've been giving is that if you had a puzzle that required a single player to push a block onto a switch and then go stand on another switch at the same time - that puzzle becomes broken if you have 2 players, because you don't need to move the block at all. See what I mean? Most of the puzzles would have to get redesigned. We had thought about increasing difficulty to accommodate 2 fully-powered players, but there are a lot of games where this system didn't work well at all - one that comes to mind is Deathspank, where the primary player became underpowered and died constantly if you added a second player since they changed the power balance. Maybe it was just broken, but we would be really hesitant to risk breaking our game in a similar way. With the budget we're proposing as our Kickstarter goal, we will only be able to develop the game as a (primarily) single player experience. We would break the bank if we tried to squeeze a full 2-player game into the budget of a single player game, since it could nearly double the number of room designs, and drastically increase the QA/testing time... But who knows... maybe we can add an expansion someday if the game is successful? @Sergio - yes, we agree about the challenge! Spelunky, BoI, and the early Zeldas are big points of inspiration for us. @Lucas we really want to give the most bang for your buck as far as replay value. We have designs for progressive unlockables, there's the backstory that's revealed in snippets each time you play, the overall layout randomization, etc etc... these are all things we hope will give players the desire to play the game over and over to see what happens next. @Caleb Steam keys have obviously been high on everyone's list, and we'd like nothing more than to guarantee that we'll have them.... *but* that's unfortunately not anything we have control over at this point. We've gone through the proper procedure (aka Greenlight) set forth by Valve and at this point it's mostly a waiting game. We have other information avenues we're pursuing, so we'll definitely keep everyone posted as we get more info on the matter. @Christopher where are you located? You should come see us at VisionCon in Springfield this weekend! <url>"goblins and fire traps" that has some XML exactly as it is used in game. @Mohammed - about the dev info, we might post some in an update, but you should probably check out our TIGsource devlog: <url>’s Drop is an excellent fit for Ouya and a path we will be pursuing in the future. @Are, thanks for the detailed breakdown! Here are some things that we hope will increase your interest in DDrop: Every zone will have (mostly) unique enemies, items, and objects, and mechanics. By mechanics, we mean one zone may have a type of sliding block that's magnetic, with unique puzzles associated with that, which appears in no other zones (or at least not in the same way). So every zone will feel like it has its own "system" and new types of puzzles or methods of navigation to find the way to the exit (or even open the exit). We'll also have different room types, such as "horde" rooms where enemies swarm you and you have to fight your way out, puzzle rooms, maze rooms... we're hoping there is a lot of variety indeed! Let us know if you have any other questions or suggestions. Thanks for your support! We definitely want to ensure that there is plenty and plenty of things to do and see, while also providing immense replay value. It's still early yet, obviously, so we have a lot of work to do in that regard! Curiously though, BoI has provided dozens of hours for a lot of people (we won't mention how many hours our own Ryan Burrell has put into it!), which makes me wonder where it fell short for you (and anyone else)? @Mohammed Ameen: Yeah, we've been keeping up with Hammerwatch on the TIGSource forums - looks very nice :) That was a little long - we'll probably put that in a for real update very soon! It's a little hard to say what the game length will be, since one would have to factor in player deaths, restarts, and so on. But our target is basically the length of the 2D Zeldas or longer. Though the randomization elements (you can't memorize level layouts) and semi-permadeath should drastically increase the time spent for a new player to finish, if you count total time. And with our random secrets, if one wanted to complete every objective and find every (randomized) secret, it might take much longer than a "normal" play-through. So in short... we really can't say just yet, since many of these systems are still in development. But we DO promise it will be a satisfying experience, and our Alpha Access backers can help us record play-through times to make sure that is the case! As for co-op, please see the stretch goals! We will post an update about this soon, but here are some details: If the goal(s) are met, we will have a limited, drop-in / drop-out coop mode for the main campaign, and 4-player deathmatch and horde mode arenas (4-player will not be available in the campaign). In the campaign co-op mode (aka "Companion Mode"), a 2nd player can drop in to assist the main player as a magical familiar or pet, but there will be limits to their abilities and duration that they can "drop in" before this ability must cool down. This is for difficulty balancing purposes (we don't want it to become too easy and make co-op a "cheat" mode). We will not be able to offer pure co-op for the main campaign, since this would totally break many puzzles. Imagine a puzzle where you have to move a block onto a switch, and then go stand on the other switch yourself. This puzzle becomes, well... not a puzzle... if the other player can go stand on the other switch without moving the block. If you think about Zelda 4 Swords (unless my memory is totally faulty), basically all puzzles are designed to require 4 people, and AI partners fill in for any remaining party members if you have <4 players. So if we made a game of this style, we would have to make the entire game coop... and *only* playable in co-op... meaning we would be designing TWO games instead of one. Unfortunately, we would need a LOT more backing to make that happen. So if we blow past every stretch goal we currently have and then some, maybe we would consider it. Tell your friends! :) @Smeggit: You are too kind, thank you. @Blair: Thanks for the encouraging words! While opinions may vary on KS as a whole, there's no denying the unprecedented interaction offered between developer and gamer, and we intend to leverage that as much as possible in making Delver's Drop more awesome than we could ever do on or own! We realize that update contains A LOT of information. It's incredibly important to us for things to be as clear and transparent as possible, and we feel like a lot ambiguity that was present in the campaign has been cleared up. That said, please let us know if you further questions; also, it would be great to know if you love, like, meh, or hate the updates we've made. @Mohammed Ameen: Yes, indeed! We actually already have the Greenlight page up: <url>’ve been surviving through 2020. Maybe bad timing, delays are expected given the times, but I wanted to know if things are still happening. Can we expect some footage or new details in the next year or two? Has the game changed a lot? Are you cutting stuff? Some kind of reconnect? I remember moderating the forums until things went quiet and the only posts that popped up were spambots, it’s been sad remembering that as my last real interaction with the project. I loved the art livestreams, the early builds, the excitement of the last hours of the campaign. I just want to know if I’ll play Delver’s Drop or grow old first. 7 years, with nothing to show for it. So last update was three years ago. If the game is still being worked on, and I’m skeptical it is, post some updates - screenshots, gameplay, anything. Otherwise just saying “we’re working on it” for three years with nothing to show is really sketchy. Been a couple months, seeing how’s it going! Hello! Sending some positive vibes. This is what happens with kickstarter sometimes and is to be expected. The fact that Pixelscopic is still replying to comments is a good sign, although a proper update would of course be very nice. Looking forward to however the game turns out, don't give up =). If you're still working on it, a one-paragraph summary update describing what's happened since the last update 3 years ago would make that more believable. Nearly 3 years since the last update. No news about how it's progressing, not a single screenshot to show that something has been done. What a waste of money. Even an update every 3 months showing any kind of progress would have kept me believing that this would eventually be completed and not just a scam. Man what a blast from the past, do you guys have anything to show for the time you've been working on this? This Kickstarter is literally the reason why I will never back another video game project. I want to request a refund because I don't believe this game will every get made, which is extremely disappointing as I was really looking forward to it during the initial campaign, considering LoZ:aLttP is one of my favourite games. Just checking in to see if things are still talked about, since I looked at the website recently. Surprisingly there are more responses here than in most games I have backed that are in development lol I will be interested to see where this ends up, especially w/ all the options today for platforms. Now I wish this would drop on the Switch since it seems like a great platform choice but I’ll be happy to play it the platform I chose to begin with. Hope you are all safe and will be interested to see a sample in the future. .....furreal wth even happened to this game I pledged like 2012...?? Don’t even remember Just dropping in to check out what's up. When I backed it I was a fellow Springpatchian, but realized I've been gone for years. Glad to see you're still on task - even if super delayed. Looking forward to more updates soon. Given that this is already nearly 7 years after the proposed delivery date, I can't see how any of the funds raised in the kickstarter remain available to continue the project unless everyone from pixelscopic is also running day jobs (or simply given up). If you are continuing on the project, please provide proper updates; if you are letting it die off, please start issuing refunds for those that request them - including myself. I backed the 200 tier for the 3" clay model and have yet to receive anything. I would have expected this to be shipped already as the models would already be made years ago... whats the ETA on early access? (why isnt the demo put up as early access with all the new stuff added to it as its done?) whats the ETA on any rewards? Hello I would like to request a refund for backing this project. It has slipped past the initial estimate by almost 7 years, with the last official Update being roughly 2.5 years ago. This silence is enough that I had actually forgotten that I backed this project, until I happened to check my list of backed projects while looking at a different project. This might have been mitigated for me if you had transitioned to an Early Access model in Steam at some point and pushed incremental updates and experiments that way, but as it stands I don't have faith that this project is capable of being completed to spec or in the near future. Guys I have to be honest. I just spent a few minutes reading through all these comments containing refund requests and vocalized disappointment. While it is good you're taking the time to respond to all of these complaints most of this could have been avoided if you just proactively put that energy into regular updates. Games go over when it comes to development. Instead of spending hours and hours responding to every complaint from people here why aren't you just posting weekly dev updates? It just doesn't make any sense. What people need here is closure and you owe them that. You either need to provide regular dev updates, release what you have and let the cards fall where they may in terms of how folks feel about the product or you need to just tell people its not happening. Anything less just feels dishonest. With every passing day you don't update or release anything it only gets harder to salvage any shred of trust from this endeavour. Hello i would like to request a refund for backing this project. I don’t want to discuss this further over email. Just refund me my pledge if you would be so kind. Thank you. Yeah Derick, just hold out another 8 or so years Why does this response sound like an artificial intelligence is just typing out basically the same thing that Splike already wrote? "I think you should begin rebuilding trust" -"We would certainly like to rebuild trust" "by reviving the communication" -"we know that communication is part of the process" "with your kickstarter backers" -"and that backers want to hear from us" "show us that you can deliver on regular updates" -"we can get back into a regular update cycle" Like... could you please just update the Kickstarter? It's such a bad look to keep responding to comments only, and your responses are just telling us nothing new. I invoke my rights under Kickstarter's Terms of Use: <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill." I demand a full refund for my pledge amount. Pixelscopic, if you're working on the game, what's keeping you from giving us regular kickstarter updates on your progress? Most people who has backed the project has most definitely forgot all about Delver's Drop. I think you should begin rebuilding the trust with your audience, by reviving the communication with your kickstarter backers. It will take time, but once you show us that you can deliver on regular updates, keeping us in the loop, hype for your game will slowly return. This game had so much promise. I met the team behind it at PAX East after backing it and it looked and felt so good. I was so excited about this one and a glimpse at KS after years of inactivity as a backer led me here, wondering if I just never added my steam code for it to my library or what have you... So sad that it lives eternally in limbo. I hope the team is still out there working on other projects as they were all tremendously nice and talented. I think a lot of the frustration felt by other backers (of this and other projects) is that if work continues on it would be great to see updates on the Project via Kickstarter updates- rather than having to go back to very old projects in Kickstarter and reviewing comments to disseminate if there's any progress- perhaps an update quarterly (no more than a few paragraphs) would appease many of the backers who are appreciative of your efforts to date? 1. This game got funded during a time when KS was blowing up, and this game received way too much money for what it is... which is a simple action game with some randomly generated rooms. 2. The team behind it had no idea how to properly budget for time. The KS launched in what... Feb 2013, and the game was expected to be finished in October of the same year? That's 8 months to finish this game, which at the time didn't seem really unreasonable until... 3. You added stretch goals that were going to drastically increase the time it would take to finish the game... I'm not sure you ever even started working on any of that stuff, but I can imagine it just made finishing the project even more daunting 4. Oddly, this game actually had a demo and I played it, and it seemed pretty fun and polished, which is why it boggles my mind that the game never got finished. It already felt really developed, so it seemed like just a matter of adding more content and tweaking a few things here and there but... 5. You ran into issues with your custom coded engine. Nightmare issues that couldn't be easily fixed. Which should have definitely been addressed BEFORE launching a Kickstarter. Get the hardest stuff out of the way and then launch the KS... don't make a super simple prototype and just hope it works out 6. You bled through money and ran out too quickly. This lead to a huge problem... how were you supposed to continue full time development to get the game finished when you could no longer sustain yourself without getting side work? It became impossible. So essentially what happened was... you got in over your head, ran out of money, and now the project is eternally in limbo because you don't have the time or resources to devote to finishing it... and there's also probably a sense that nothing you release will be good enough to compensate for the tremendous amount of time people have been waiting for the game. What I don't understand is how you can keep making lengthy replies to people each month but can't simply toss us an actual KS update? It looks REALLY bad to post monthly updates and then just... disappear for a solid YEAR. It's happened more than once. I just find it super odd. At this point I would just call this a failure and move on with life. I know people will be upset but people are already upset... and backing a kickstarter comes with the risk of not receiving anything. I'm not even mad about getting no game for my money at this point. It happens. You aren't a professional studio with a long history of delivering games... you have no funds... I can't reasonably expect you to finish this game or refund my money. I don't get the people asking for refunds, as if you have any money left after 6+ years to refund them. The entire point of the KS was that you didn't have the money to finish the game. You're right back at that point... so it's not really realistic that you could refund anyone unless it's coming out of your own pocket, which just seems a bit unfair to me. You've suffered enough. We've suffered enough. Just put the game out of it's misery instead of this limbo where you can't admit you've failed. Honestly as a fellow developer this game seems almost ridiculously easy to recreate in Unity or something nowadays with maybe a few months dev time. It's not exactly a massively complicated game. 6+ years to make this shows incompetence at a grand level. Another studio could have made this game from scratch in between the time it's taken you to make an update apologizing for no updates. Just passing by to do the yearly check: seems like the fraud keeps on. You're lucky that Kickstarter just allows to get away with the money without any product being delivered ... No. Hi Shariq, I'm fairly certain Pixelscopic are just grifters! I hate to ask for this, but how do I go about requesting a refund? It has been seven years, my life is nowhere near what it was back then, I have a child with the second on the way so I wouldn't even have time for something like this anymore, so I'd like to get my money back. The last update is from 2 years ago. Post an update every month. It doesn't have to be long. But you have to show that this project isn't dead. Did you guys consider my advice from before? You really ought to start a Discord or something. I actually bought an Ouya and was looking forward to using it as my go to machine for indie games. Unfortunately it came out a bit too late. If only there was as much work on an honest update declaring the project dead as responding to comments. What a waste of a great concept. I'm pretty sure that he was being sarcastic. Nobody ever wanted Ouya. Just stopping by to catch up on all the comments of my favorite failed Kickstarter campaign since that's the most I'm ever going to get out of my $40 pledge. The funniest part is the lack of an update after 2 years, but the ongoing comment replies. Oh well. I'll be back in another year or so to read up, laugh and commiserate with the other abandoned backers here. Can't wait to play this on my OUYA! Give us a roadmap. Tell us what has been happening these past 7 years. As a backer (and for other backers) I don't think that's asking too much at all. If you don't or can't, then I agree with others here that this was poorly managed and our money is as good as gone. Just checking in :) Glad to see things are still alive! I will be waiting in the wings for release :) I wrote that a year ago, it is still true sadly: "Creator will reply to you that : He is sorry. It took much more time than anticipated. They had to rebuild the engine. That it is coming along. He will still : not talk about a timeframe. not show in game screenshot. not show gameplay video. not write a new update. We will still be pretty much in limbo for the year we will get the game, what will finally be in the final version of the game. We will be here in one year writing the same things, and the creator will be answering with his non-answers." Was going through my backer history and I'm glad to see you guys are still hanging in there and working on the game. Have you thought about sending out a simple, straightforward update here on Kickstarter to let everyone know what's going on? No need to get specific (although it would be nice) and it might quell some of the dissatisfaction I'm seeing in the comments while boosting your PR a bit. Sadly this project has caused me to never want to back another game project on kickstarter. It has been almost 7 years with nothing to show for it other than a demo that was released on humble bundle towards the beginning of this project getting funded. Such a disappointment as this game looked so promising. I accepted the truth that this will never be finished. No matter how much you say that you plan to finish it at a certain point it isn't worth it. Even if it miraculously is finished i wont bother playing it. What a waste of $50. So, since the higher level physical rewards are clearly never being delivered, how about refunding at least the difference they all paid. Here to claim the 1000th comment. Here's to a 1000 more! Please just release whatever you have of the game as open source and admit you spent the money on bringing the team's families to the Bahamas, paid off your mortgage, or something. Showing us photos of your brand new Tesla Model X would be better than nothing. Your websites are completely broken and demonstrate you couldn't code yourself out of an OPEN paper bag. There is absolutely no reason why it's 2019 and this 2D game STILL isn't out yet in some form. This project got DOUBLE the "needed" funding for this project and couldn't deliver on time. Stop wasting people's hopes. Look at these other comments offering well wishes and rightfully asking where this project went. I feel bad for that one schmuck who actually poured $200 into this. Well, hopefully you guys could release an update just to say that hi, we are alive and what we have been doing for the past 2 years or so. Since not everyone will be looking at the comments, if they were to just look at the update, it would look as if you guys have abandon ship. It is a fine thing to use personal funds for a labor of love that you do on the side as a hobby while holding another full time job. It is not a fine thing to take $150,745 USD from 4,534 people for a digital product that you have not finished making 6 years after its estimated delivery date. You know this at both a logical and visceral level. You refuse to provide transparency in the form of a plan with dates, and you have spouted years of weasel words in this forum. I wonder if you even have a plan or if you have just been "playing" all these years. If you do have a plan written down, it is clearly the wrong one and you need to print that sucker out and light it on actual fire. Then stop producing assets such as artwork (I know you like to draw but it is not time for that anymore). Any assets that are not finished like a character without all of its frames or animation tweens... just set that aside for now. Look at what you have left that is most complete. Assemble it together as simply as you can and get version 1 released while perhaps being embarrassed by it. Let people laugh at you and take it. Let me tell you guys... Most of your backers are not expecting anything great from you anymore. That expectation and general faith has dwindled these many years. After it is released and the pressure is off and a product delivered, take as long as you like to refine the game in another release. Make it the game you meant it to be on your own time, as a hobby, as a labor of love, while you hold a full time job. wow, i had forgotten about this game and was only looking through my list. Hopefully we will see an update soon to at least explain what is going with the radio silence. Glad to hear that the devs are still actively replying to questions/comments. I value that deeply. I do have to echo an uneasiness about the project, though. Having someone to talk with is AMAZING, but is there any way to prioritize securing an ETA? Again, I'm very impressed/reassured that someone is responding to these posts/comments so quickly and am not trying to come across the wrong way.. just curious and a little concerned about the timeline as well. Guys your backers need a date. I work in software development. At some point you have to mark the product as finished and move it out the door. You can always continue to patch the product after release. Keeping your backers in the dark is not going to be good for your prospects when it comes to making additional games down the road. You guys need to ship the game. Any plans on an actual update? Since the last one was November of 2017? Not complaining. Just nice to know everyone is alive, and that you are still working. It took roughly a year to post an early build (with decent core functionality) after funding was established. It's been 5 years since that build so I have to wonder what 'working hard' means at this point. I know development takes time but all we've seen in the last 5 years are apologies - nearly 1,000 of them to date. Please just send the physical rewards out to those who paid extra and let the rest of us accept the fact that this project failed. I just want to play the thing. I liked it in the early build and it seemed like all that was needed was levels and content. Now it has been years :( Came for an update found that we are still alive all right, guess ill check back in a while again. Stay strong! Woah I just looked at these comments and had assumed this project was dead for a couple of years now. Good luck to you all and stay safe out there. I moved out of Cassville years ago, but I still think about the indie devs down the road haha. Miss hearing from you guys on Twitter on as well! I think you've probably answered enough of these comments that you could almost copy/paste them into an update by the way... While you're at it though, a simple list of what parts of the game are done, what parts aren't, and what you are currently working on would be good and maybe even rough percentages if you are feeling frisky. So I'm guessing the physical rewards are never coming. Any chance for a refund? That's usually a part of a game development cycle, so it's always interesting to know how things happens, and how are they fought. So how is it going ? Glad you didn't abandon the project, but can we have some sort of info about the difficulties you encounter and where you're at. Hey, I was a backer in the beginning. Is there a demo or steam key out at least for us? This game was in kickstarter before I got diagnosed with MS almost 6 years ago. lol. Please be alive Yo! Wanted to check up on this project. Based on recent comments below, looks like ya'll are still chugging away. Great to hear! Though, be nice to see a backer update sent out once every couple of months or so, if you can. Best of luck, really looking forward to seeing all the progress ya'll have made in the future! Estimated delivery Oct 2013 This is dead, right? Not even an alpha (previous comment) since 2014? Admit this is dead and cancel it. Is the v079 from 2014 still the latest early access version? Hey thanks for reading. I have no doubt you guys are still hard at work. I sent you a message re: Discord. :) Hey fellas. I know you're hard at work on the game still, but you really gotta regularly update backers on progress. One update every two months at the very least. You can't allow the project to look abandoned, which it does. Set up a Discord or something. Gotta keep people who have paid money in the loop. Still looking forward to this game. Hope to play it soon. Much love. Hey Pixelscopic folks, anything cool happening lately? I started college when the campaign started and I’ll be graduating this May. Crazy how time goes by. I think about the game every so often and still have my shirt from PAX East back in 2014 I think? It almost feels like this fable that I tell friends about then remember it’s still not released. I await the day I can finally show them what got me excited about the game in the first place. ;) By the by, would you guys ever have any interest in 3D modelers? I’m still totally amateurish but it’s been my aspiration for years to design and animate 3D game characters and I’m slowly getting there. I’ve dabbled a bit with 3D Printing in the past as well if that piques interest at all, maybe I can PM some samples of projects I’ve worked on! If you happen to know any good sites/communities to start looking for work and help in those areas I would be super appreciative! There’s not a whole lot of good game dev connections to make here in NJ. - Chris I backed the $200 NOSTALGIC ERA TIER ● Sculpted 3" Clay Rogue Figurine by Leah Williams (maker of Little Lazies) when can I expect the figure to be sent? I mean its been years and you guys already had them made Happy New year to the whole Team :) Ryan, it would be nice if you would take the time to recap the last year and what you and the other Team Member have worked on so we Backer get an better understanding what might be still missing in the Game or which parts of the Game might be already finished. What you Guys should also consider is maybe getting in Contact with Nintendo since they are usually very Indie Friendly if it comes to Dev Kits. Besides that: Good luck and a great 2019. Take the time you need to finish the Game and keep us more often in the loop on what you Guys are working on even if some things might take longer then you had first expected :D How do I get the game? It's been many years since I've heard an update From the site order page: "Buying through the Humble widget grants you immediate access to PC and Mac versions (and later Linux and Android versions) of the game through the Humble Store. " Humble do not list the game for sale. As a backer, how do I access these builds? What's the best way to follow progress - it's not easy finding updates via comments like this on a (pretty old!) Kickstarter - and it seem's you've abandoned providing Updates via Kickstarter? SO after 5 years or more of nothing but words from this game, heck Ive never even been able to play any of the demos, Im wondering if I can just get a refund. I dont even play console games anymore at this point so waiting any longer for me is moot. What's stopping a 'rough around the edges' alpha build from being released, just so we can see *some* indication of progress? I too don't really expect to see this game ever see the light of day, but now I am curious, if you say you are working on it, what exactly are you working on and how close to do you "think" you are to finishing or maybe even just having another beta/alpha build? I just commented on Asylum which I also backed. It is 5 years now and not even a demo. Delays like this have poisoned the water for me. I do not now back software because once the money is delivered the pace of (any) development drags down to a crawl. I don't expect to receive this game either. You and the others (there are still others?) working on the game must have a job, social life and family maybe, so there must be not much time to work on the game. There must be an extremely slow rate of advancement on the game, just the fact that you won't give us a time frame, a new one, and not even screenshots, even less a video of the game, I think you are still working mostly on the engine. What I think is that in another 5 years from now, you won't be finished. I must confess I like coming back every few months to read about new people on the team and pore over the same excuses given for the last 5 years. I'm sure you had every intention of finishing this game but it's quite obvious the project failed some time ago. @DrZ: you mean you still don’t have your ouya? But yeah I gave up on this game like 3 years ago. So any chance that the physical reward will every be sent? I know the game is being worked on, but is there any chance those of use that pledged higher will ever see when physical rewards? If not, a refund would be appreciated. I'm afraid to say that this is why I won't back indie games on Kickstarter any more. I tend to back board games and video games, and the list of indie video games that haven't yet delivered, several YEARS after being backed, is just embarrassing. The board games list is mostly complete, with delays of a year about the worst I've seen. I really hope this project eventually sees the light of day, but I know that I, for one, don't have any interest in actually playing it any more. Regards. Now that it's been half a decade, and there's still nothing to show. Maybe it's time to throw in the towel, or offer people still paying attention to your little pet project refunds. I feel like your design roadmap was drawn by your kids with crayons, and you just thought it was so wonderful and special that you couldn't NOT do it. Admit defeat, wave that white flag. not via PM, discuss them here, we are all backers. is this project still alive? Creator will reply to you that : He is sorry. It took much more time than anticipated. They had to rebuild the engine. That it is coming along. He will still : not talk about a timeframe. not show in game screenshot. not show gameplay video. not write a new update. We will still be pretty much in limbo for the year we will get the game, what will finaly be in the final version of the game. We will be here in one year writing the same things, and the creator will be answering with his non-answers. After looking through projects that I’ve backed and seeing that a few Devs just failed to deliver and then went radio silent. I respect that you guys have sent out different playable versions and are still responsive in the comments. I would appreciate a few smaller updates either monthly or quarterly as most times when I check on Kickstarter I just look for updates. So I just read two long responses by the Pixelscopic team, describing how the project went off track. Here's the thing - at what point do you decide to cut scope in favor of completing the project? Because that's what experienced game developers do. We realize at some point in the process that some set of features is beyond our abilities, and we CUT those features. Random, Zelda-like dungoens? Cut 'em, and make a few by hand - you could have been finished by now. Roll-your-own game engine? Cut it, in favor of any one of the NUMEROUS robust game engines available off the shelf. If Unreal is goo enough for Cliffy B., it's sure as hell good enough for you guys. Fancy in-game physics? Cut them, in favor of mechanics based on existing, off-the-shelf physics solutions. Again - there are tons of these. Sorry fellas, but if you're still slogging away trying to create some grand masterpiece of design and technology while ignoring the obvious cuts, you've missed the VERY FIRST LESSON of game development - MAKE CUTS SO YOU CAN SHIP. PS: If you don't believe that I know what I'm talking about when it comes to game dev, maybe you should Google my name ;-) I can't wait for my OUYA copy! Thanks for your answers. It's great to see that the game is still being in works October 2013 — RELEASE! for PC, Mac, Linux: The game is 100% complete and (as reasonably as possible) bug free. Since we are one quarter away from 5 years past the predicted release is there an official update? I haven't seen a new alpha since the initial release to backers. The alpha demo was fun but is there a beta? What happened that this game is so far off the timeline? You guys know we backers are somewhat used to getting told that your projects failed? You may safely tell us instead of letting us hope untill every single backer is in his grave 😂 It's gone quiet around this project. There's nothing to report? cant you just send me out the Sculpted 3" Clay Rogue Figurine by Leah Williams (maker of Little Lazies) that you must already got created (I just dont want them to be lost...) Time to update to C++17! :D Delver's Drop is definitely not dead! It's just like a hobby for the developers. Surely you were improving the camera and dungeon generation for like 5 years... hope it's going well, take your time This is dead right? I wonder what'll happen first, my Delver's Drop shirt from back during PAX East wearing out or the game coming out. If it's the former you guys totally owe me another shirt at least. (Because that shirt has been well-loved) ;) I think something that would be great for the community is to offer us something, anything really, as far as content and preview. Most of us at this point that are still active are understanding of long/slow development of complex games, so we're not entirely surprised by a lack of updated demos. BUT! Surely you have something you can show us? If possible small tech demos (like a single room that shows off updated physics) would be cool as well. And even if that's not possible then videos and even game art are highly appreciated. Showing us the progress you've made, rather than vaguely speaking in its direction, is what we really want right now since we are you BACKERS, rather than your customers! Any news on when the next update (either as in kickstarter update, or playable build, or both) might drop? One day it might release. I backed that project when I was in high school. I am now studying at a University :^] As much as I'm disappointed it's not released yet, if it does come out and comes out good, I'll be satisfied. I've seen too many roguelites releasing in the past years that were ok, but not great so here's hoping this one will be in a better shape if it ever releases. I just popped on to catch up on comments and download the latest build... from 2014. I know you ran into problems but bloody hell. ETA on release? I need to update my backer info since I moved about 3 times since backing this project. I can't believe how long it's been... yikes. What the actual fuck is taking you so long? Looking forward to future updates, and to play the game! Hey guys. Release anything. Do notes, please? You guys can rally your team together and get a patch list up at least, right? When is the OUYA release? Do you have a release date set? It's been a while since an update. How're things going guys? "A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad" Shigeru Miyamoto And a game fallen into development hell loses sight of what it wanted to be in the first place and ends up terrible anyway. Hope the game is still going FYI - The pixelscopic forums are throwing a database error. I hadn't seen any activity on there for a while as of the last time I checked, but it seems to be down completely now. Any updates soon? @Pixelscopic I just wanted to say that i, one of many, appreciate that you guys are still trying to make a great game instead of simply dropping it. As long as the game gets released right, i don't care if i have to wait 20 years for it to happen. "A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad" Shigeru Miyamoto 4 years anniversary of initial estimated delivery date (October 2013). So, where are things at currently? Hi guys. I hope the project is still kicking. Could you post a brief update in here if you have the time? It would be appreciated I'm sure. How can you guys survive for 4 years from these few bucks? � Hi there, I'm wondering where I can report this project to Kickstarter? I'll look around some more and figure it out, just seeing if you guys have any insight. Mainly because paying $50 for a pledge 4 years ago is getting... old? Thanks. In a broader sense than release dates, can you give a general idea of progress, something like "X milestones remaining for feature-complete alpha" or "70% feature complete" or what not? I understand not having an exact date, but having a sense of how much there's left to do would be nice (even if the remaining parts are nonlinear and take up more time than other parts) What's your current release target? Anything at all? I get things were hard but operating with no deadlines whatsoever is very dangerous. I would like to request a refund for this game, please advise. Thank you. So... is there an announced release date for this? I backed this project to give my extra copy as a gift to someone who was excited about this game, but I'm not even friends with that person anymore... I'm not holding out high hopes that this will turn into a great game, but even shovelware on Steam beats nothing at all... I want a refund on this. It is three years past the original listed release date. Awesome! There was a recent article with NintendoEverything that the Nintendo Switch development console will only cost 50,000 japanese yen ($500). I felt a port for that device would be more apt than other big video game consoles. The control flexibility of the Nintendo Switch seems perfect for this game. Give a look if you're interested. Cheers. <url>"it'll happen eventually"? Because being an afterthought after major rewrite to your engine, and after four years of indie development isn't really showing Linux users respect. Yes I understand we're a small portion, but we supported you, and we at least deserve an update on what our support has done to bring the game closer to supporting Linux. I hope this comment doesn't come off too snarky, but Linux gamers have been burned a LOT since this game has gone into development. Please don't burn us again. So what's the update as the end of the year has passed? Going on 4 years now since I pledged. Some progress or a refund would be welcome at this point. Is there any news on this? I want a refund on this. It's three years past the original listed release date, and still no game. It's ridiculous. In the mood to play something like Delver's Drop and it occured to me it's been quiet a long time. So while I'm happy to see that there is communication here on the Kickstarter comments I'm not so happy to see that it's been almost 10 months since a KS update, and all the improvements that have been talked about havent even been released for any of us backers to play with. We understand incomplete, but as backers we want to be a part of that. open up a bit, let us play builds, give the community back some ownershp and pride in this game. Honestly, this has gone on too long. It would feel a lot more honest if the game's website wasn't still trying to sell pre-orders, with no news to offer would be buyers since a Feb 2014 blog post!!! It's unfortunate, but this, and a few other smaller titles which have totally stopped any releases or communications have soured me and stopped me backing a lot of projects. I would also like a refund. This is ridiculous. I get that we were backing knowing that the game may not be made, but man 3 years is ridiculous for what this game is. I've lost 100% of my interest. Can i ask for a refund? 3 years man... when can the 25 people who backed the level for the Sculpted 3" Clay Rogue Figurine by Leah Williams expect to get it? What's the status of this game? There's a download via my humble store but is it beta? If this takes any longer I fear another engine rework using C++17! SCNR! I feel like I have to say something here - I'm sorry that the "negativity" on Kickstarter is bothering you guys, but this game was due out in October of '13. I get set backs and delays; I work in software and web dev myself, but if my company put a deadline for three years previous and we still hadn't delivered, customers would be screaming for our heads and we'd have lawyers kicking down our doors. You don't post regular updates (last update was from February for god's sake), you've vastly overpromised and have underdelivered, and while you seem to be okay communicating here under the comments, we still don't have any firm dates or release windows. People gave you guys $150k because of what you guys promised. So when is this game coming out? Is this game coming out? Or are all your backers out their money? At least be honest if that's the case, because this is ridiculous. @Pixelscopic - Thanks for your reply. I can see how posting updates could start to feel like a negative process when you've hit a series of setbacks and delays. Try to keep in mind that while there is a fair bit of negativity on kickstarter, the vast majority of your backers (myself included) want to see you succeed. I hope the team is able to figure out an update schedule that works for you and also keeps us backers in the loop. Best of luck to you all! :) Hey guys, I realize you've been waiting for a big breakthrough in your engine before posting an update, but it's getting a bit ridiculous. I mean the last update is one day away from literally being half a year ago. I'm not posting this to make you feel bad, and I'm really glad you're still working on the game. I'm still eager to play it. I'd just like to be kept in the loop a bit more, ya know? :) Generally speaking a lot of KS projects I've backed have an easier time communicating with their audience if they change to short updates rather than long ones. Even just sending out an update that literally says "Hey, we're still working on a big physics update to the engine. It's taking longer than we'd hoped, but here's what our artists have been working on." followed by a couple pictures would be better than radio silence. Short updates reassure people that the project is still alive, and they're way easier for you to make so they aren't as much of a distraction to development. Just some food for thought. Keep up the good work. The game still looks amazing! :D Is there another location to get information on this project? From the comments it seems like you guys are still active so I was wondering if there is some other portal for information outside of kickstarter. If not it isn't a big deal; things happen. I've figured that about 10 - 20% of kickstarter games I've backed turn into ghost towns for one reason or another. I was just going through my list of "dead kickstarter games" and was surprised to see that you guys don't seem totally dead. Will this come out for 3DS, Wii U or NX? (or rather, are there any plans to release this game on actual gaming devices) Nintendo has recently overhauled the development process and is available to anyone now. (would maybe need a second Kickstarter due to devkit prices, though) Came here expecting to see a lot of disappointed posts from backers but am pleasantly surprised that you are still responding. Thanks a lot for your effort to do this. I hope to see some form of an update maybe just a basic hello we are still alive! thanks! Just wondering what addess you guys have for me since you're sending physical rewards soon. I sent an email a while ago but didn't receive the postcard you said you would send me. Holy cow, forgot about this. I went in big ($300 level.) Are we still going to be getting all the listed physical rewards (art, collector's box, clay figure, etc...). Also don't remember if I ever submitted my "likeness" or item information. Thanks! Did the physical items ever get sent out, the extras to the tiers? If so I never got mine. What should I do? Are there still plans to put this game on steam? If so, I'm curious why you haven't decided to put the game up for sale as early access. Are you guys offering refunds at all? I have yet to play the game it self but I was under the impression that this was released, lest on the humble bundle it looked like it was. Is it still in beta or? Hard to find this game, not on steam or listed on humble bundle, or even a review of this game, all I have seen in alpha previews and lets plays. Glad to see you're still responding. Hope to play a new build soon. Contrary to Rik's comment about losing interest in the game, my tastes have changed in that I'm even MORE excited for this game! Games like The Binding of Isaac, Nuclear Throne, and the soon to be released Enter The Gungeon have solidified my love for the top-down rogue-like. What makes Delver's Drop even more interesting to me is the medieval fantasy aesthetic, which none of those other games have, and which was one of the reasons I backed in the first place. Rather than being dismayed with the lateness of completion, I'm more impressed with your dedication to finish the game despite the long development cycle. Keep up the hard work, and I'll still be here when your done, ready to play a masterpiece of a game that combines elements of all my favorite games. I'm probably in the minority here, as I see a lot of commenters below me getting impatient, but the majority of my Kickstarter pledges on other projects have been fulfilled, so I don't feel ripped off for having pledged on one or two projects that took longer than expected and I'd rather the money I pledged still be of some use to you guys. Dear Pixelscopic, is this project still alive? The latest update was from more than 5 weeks ago, the latest build I see on Humble is of june 2014!!! All I see is a fancy website with big pre-order buttons. It's still coming for Ouya, even though Ouya doesn't exist anymore? The forum seems to be dead as well, the latest reply in the "Info + updates" board is from November 2015. Looking at the "most recent posts on the forum", it seems that there is around 1 post every 2 weeks or so... I find all of this not really convincing that there is a clear vision of where the game is headed and when things are planned along the roadmap. The initial estimated release date was August 2013. Now I understand that ambitions have changed and I already thought back then that it was a very ambitious release date. But okay, things change and you guys adapt, which I actually admire. However, it is now March 2016! That's 2,5 years delay on Delver's Drop. The game has totally lost my interest to be honest with you. What are your plans to make progress on the game and have a solid release? In the december update you write that will be a solid and playable build in early 2016. In my view, next week marks the end of "early 2016" and I'm at this point assuming, there is no build coming over the Eastern weekend. Also you write that have people started to ask for refunds and that you try to talk with them to "alleviate concerns and meet the needs of customers while they wait for the game to be released". But it's 9 months after infamous update #41 where you explain why the game is taking so long. 9 months! In my opinion, stating that a backer asking for a refund is harming the game's quality is very rude. People that have waited 2,5 years on a game that was expected to be finished between February 2013 and August 2013 are not the ones to blame I would say. My last worry is the actual amount of money that you got via the Kickstarter. You got about 150k back in February 2013. With a 3 man team working for 2,5 years this must be running low (more likely it has been spent a long time already), so how do you expect to even finish the game? My feeling right now is that I'm going to await your response to my concerns and make a decision whether or not to ask for a refund based on this. The game to me still looks incredibly fun to play, but I have lost interest because a) the game has been delayed so much and b) my personal taste has also changed the last 2 years, so I'm not really into these type of games anymore. Best wishes, Rik Any updates...? I really appreciate the thoroughness of the updates, but honestly the one question I care about is never answered: what's the schedule on finishing the game? Do you have a set development plan still or is it just ongoing "until it's done"? I really loved the first demo way way back at PAX, and I'm not a player interested in Alpha builds or what we now call "Early Access" titles. Even if your date is, say, Jan 2018 - I'd really prefer to see that at the very beginning of your update emails instead reading 6-10 extremely detailed paragraphs that don't mention the most important milestone of the project. It's disappointing because this was the very first video game project I backed, and it has soured me against supporting other video game projects. Lastly, replying to comments about refunds and release dates on this backer page with directions to direct message the team privately is poor customer service. Backers shouldn't have to do that to get an answer to a very, VERY basic and obvious question. If you're committed to giving refunds, say that. If you want one last chance to change our minds, say that. But dodging the issue and trying to keep it quiet really hurts your credibility as a company. I'm not trying to sound like an idiot, but is there a way to play this game yet? I know development is super hard and if not, it's ok with me, but I'm just wondering if I missed something. I originally asked for a refund back in April, but decided to hang on and wait longer and be patient :). But at this point.. it's 2 years past the promised date so I would like a refund please. @pixelscopic thanks for reply, look forward to it :) hey @pixelscopic thanks for the updates. I think I asked this a year ago but wondered if we'd be able to get a Steam key at any point? It's purely from a super lazy point of view. I run Steam in BP mode and play exclusively from the couch so it'd be great to be able to get all the updates without a m+kb :D Hi all. Thanks for the update, still looking forward to the games completion. Keep slogging at it, it'll come, eventually. :) Wow, I just followed the notice back here, was this really initially for Oct of 2013? Guys, honestly I loved the idea of this game but holding my money for nearly two years is a bit much. Is there a way to push for a refund, I'm sure you'll make it out eventually but wow.. I had no idea you guys were this far behind. Hi, I was just wondering if I could get a refund. I'm going to be honest, I've lost interest in the project over the past few years. Thanks. so when can we expect the physical rewards? I should be getting the below ● Sculpted 3" Clay Rogue Figurine by Leah Williams (maker of Little Lazies) ● Cloth Map of the game world ● (all previous rewards) Hi! I don't remember getting the email with the code. Where should I look? Thanks! for the Update. Are you working on any other projects besides delver's drop? I backed the Double Fine Adventure game also, not disapointed at all Are you guys still planning on an Ouya release? That company is up for sale and the platform has been a major disappointment thus far mostly used for pirating ROMs. Can we all agree that a PS Vita release would be a better use of your time? I backed this 2 years ago at the $30 tier.. are you offering refunds for those of us that don't want to wait any longer? Thanks for the update Good to be in the loop again! And I'm glad everything is on rails, even though you feel like it's not going at break-neck speeds. But slow progress is still progress :) Over the past months I've been thinking about how I will play this game when it's released. As you say, you wish for Delver's Drop to be on the PC and Android (to name a few), so I am very much hoping you will put in Steam Cloud Sync and a way for our game saves to be synced across all platforms. So when I pick my android tablet up, I will be playing the same steam save from my PC. Hope this will be possible and keep up the good work :) I've never minded Kickstarters going over the projected delivery date, because that's the nature of entrepreneurship and independent product development, which is why I come here. I do, however, dislike not seeing any updates over a long period. I've read your other comments and can understand the desire to not want to communicate until you have good news. And I can only speak for myself, not all other backers. But personally I would prefer to see some sort of regular update, even if it's just about some random anecdote that came up while debugging a level or how a bird got into the office. That at least shows a willingness on the part of the developers to engage with the project and with the backers. It would also be great to see an updated release date even if it's super general, like, "within the next 18 months." Then at least I know what the latest word is. It's been very quiet, but at least you're responding here. That's a good sign. I hope everything is well. Soooooo, If you know that communication has been sparse, why not send a short Update to the backers witth an apology, explanation for the delay and a teaser for the next big update? Delays can happen, that is not the problemm. But your PR could REALLY need some work, guys. No updates in over 6 months now... Kind of sad. Also, I never received any of my backer rewards... So, I'm guessing this game is dead. "estimated delivery August 2013". Another Godus-style kickstarter. Disappointing. This is why I don't use kickstarter anymore. Do you guys still work on this? Was looking forward to hear something about "Digital Game Soundtrack ● Digital Concept Art Pack" maybe if not for another update about the state of the game. Hey, 50$ backer here. How is this truckin' along? I haven't heard anything from you guys in quite a while. Heya guys, Happy New Year to all and keep up the good work. It'll be an awesome game for 2015. :) wasn't sure if to post here, but i never realized you had sent some to the things like the post cards and such to the backers. i never got those, its probably too late at this point , but is there anyway i would be able to get them. i backed a 120, hope i didnt miss out on the art book as well Hey guys ! Congratz for the work already done ! I'm a french backer, and a pretty sure it will be a great game ! Even if there is a delay, I keep confidence ! Hey will you be releasing this through steam or do you have a beta version on there. I'm a $30 tier backer and would love to redeem it there so I don't have to worry about updates :) So...almost a month since any word, a year behind schedule, and double your original funding goal. What's going on? Any news on this? is there any news on the IOS version ? Any updates? So I'm having trouble finding a download link for the newest build. Doesn't appear to be in the Early Access forum. Was it sent in an email? Just downloaded the latest from my humble account, it gives me a guy with a key ring and a bunch of cages. Not sure how to unlock them or to play. Thanks for coming down to OzCon! I really enjoyed and appreciated the advice you gave at the game dev panel. I have stopped receiving any updates and have not received my beta key. When I go to the humble page my email address is not on file. Is the game out yet for backers ? Never got any emails about it Hey guys, the game's looking awesome! I'm part of the $15 tier and I was wondering if we get to be part of the alpha or beta. If not, then when is the game set to come out? I'm dying to play it! thanks, cant wait for the full release of the game, i havnt played the recent build but i was enjoying one of the older builds quite a bit. keep up the good work Are any progress updates available on the next alpha? hi everyone, i have not been keeping up with this as well as i should, but have they announced when they are going to ship the items for backers like the t-shirts and such, just wandering Played some of the alpha. Is very good. I kinda feel like you need a click and hold ability so you can kind of slash and keep things back rather than hammering the left mouse button. Even if it did less damage it would be good. You'll probably say that's in the game. I'll keep messing around. keep up the good work Thank you :D Hey Pixelscopic. I'm a $30 backer and been AWOL for a while. I've dug through my emails and can't find anything about how to access the Beta. Am I able to access it or am I being a pleb? Just tried out the game an unfortunately I can't play it. I get motion sickness and the sorta wavy camera, the way it lags behind where the character is then slowly centers back on the character, it just really makes my motion sickness act up in the worst ways. I can't play it for more than 5 minutes without feeling like I need to hurl. So I humbly request you look into adding a camera option so it's static on top of your character the entire time, if at all possible. Otherwise I fear I will have helped fund a cool game without ever being able to play it. Thank you for your time and consideration. Ack, late reply. Will provide more feedback there! Thanks for the reply (: Hi there, I know it's alpha and all but, am I the only one concerned about how sluggish the controls and movement of the character are? The ambience, music and graphics are all pretty great fyi, but are there any plans to tighten the movement? Perhaps not having a slide effect after one has finished moving etc. Will Linux support be coming to the beta? Delver's Drop was greenlit, congrats :D Since they are making Twice the game, having to wait a few more months for more content due to the games success is a given. Honestly the demos are great and it shows that they are not slacking and truly getting the game to be all that we want and would expect. I cant wait to see the final product at the end of the year. good to read that this game is still being released this fall/winter! woot! Don't know if this has been asked but have you gone to Ouya to see if they would match funds for DD? They recently put out and announcement saying they would match investment funds up to $250k. <url>"This application has failed to start because XINPUT1_3.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem" however no matter how many times I re-install, I get the same error. Is this a common occurrence or does the problem lie with my computer? I'm not certain I caught the survey email and responded while the survey was available. I have a digital-only tier, so... Erk? Actually nevermind <url>#rewards No, I meant it was on the actual Steam launcher. Just thought I would share that if you go onto Steam and click learn more about the steam trading cards and then rewards, about a little more than halfway down the page there is a Greenlight Showcase and the game is Delver's Drop! Could this mean something? I'm really starting to dislike steam greenlight. I really don't understand why they can't have an x% of the way there progress bar. I mean, I guess it is probably a little fuzzier than that, but they should at least release number of Yes's once something gets 'lit, so that you have a general idea of how many votes it takes. Releasing no information makes it seem shady, like you're supposed to slip them some money or something. Delver's drop didn't make it through greenlinght in today's batch :( honestly think it deserve's it more than some of the games there. Lawl, no prob, take your time. It's not like I'm having a baby here and need your forums and character art to set it on or else it'll explode. Eagerly awaiting the update! :3 Looking forward to the update!! Are any updates available on the forums? I'm not sure if this has been answered already and I am just unable to find it or not, but for tiers that have exclusive content as well as a second copy of the game, does this second copy have the same content or will it only have open beta access and otherwise be the retail version of the game? Pay pal just gotta make over 20 k in a day now :). Friends told me you did a good job at PAX and that your game indeed plays well. I'm happy to see you guys climbing up the ladder! PS: Good job on improving the plague rat behavior! I thought it worth sharing here, if people are looking for a neat dungeon game: Desktop Dungeons is free beta to play until 31st March. The alpha has been out for a while and is free for ever, also. It's very neat and tide over until Delver's Drop: <url>"pure zelda" reaction comparison to Delver's Drop, which seems incorrect, but obviously going off the title. That might be an area of communication to work with? It seems more roguelike-like to me, that endless drop mode for eg than a zelda rpg-story questing. The black space (rectangles), can the delver fall and die into those, or are they just a barrier to path around the room/dungeon? As said, the gameplay already LOOKS fun and I've not played it. Any more nuggets to share on the story: Will it be text conversation clues and narrative? Bet pax was a great event. Cheers! @Any potential visitors - You can still contribute to this amazing game through paypal at <url>"female" character called Bob the Barbarian or something like that. I just think think it would be neat to have that option even if the only real change might be the name database. Though I'd also think it would be cool to have male/female models. @Blue-demon - They mentioned on their stream that they may put it in because the original idea was that someone would back 5000 then use the share option to get it out to the rest of the community, but at the moment they are not sure. @Pixelscopic I forgot to ask, since we had no $5,000 what exactly are the plans for the Icarian Wings? Can't wait to give the Alpha a try later on. a hearty congratulations.. well done Team Pixelscopic! :) If all else fails, with the main page poster update, you could always post a final stretch goal poster with the grand total in an update after PayPal pledges have closed. Sadly i misread the Update#16 otherwise i wouldve changed my pledge to $25 or smth. @KW I think $2 should be the going price for new characters, perhaps $2.49 & $4.99 for new expansions. And if it's as big or bigger than the campaign, then $6.99. I think those numbers would be reasonable and entice :) That extra puzzle-mode is the cherry on top of, the icing (multiplayer x3 versions) on the cake (delver's drop)!! Update the progress chart to fill in 150k$ stretch goal when you wake up *cracks whip*. ;) Whoops - my credit card details were outdated on amazon payments -_-. Just fixed it - hopefully it all turns out alright! Looking forward to the amazing work from this! Can't wait to see a dev blog/forum/etc! Congrats. :) It hit 150k. Wow kickstarter sure is a awsome crazy system. Now onto the Halls of Lost Sanity! (kudos whoever came up witht hat name). Congratulations! Take your time to celebrate and enjoy your project. Good to hear that the extra class is confirmed! *yawn* Congrats on reaching the goal! *rubs eyes* $150k!! \o/ Woo, party time! I am glad for the puzzle rooms, as it was the one stretch goal I was really interested in beyond 100K (though of course more content is good, I mean come on, people love content, right? $2.50-5.00 per class and $7.50-10.00 per expansion, just saying.) I caught a bit of the stream but was working at school on my finals, so I'm wondering if we'll be able to get a look at the class concepts sometime in the future? I only caught them for a couple minutes, and well pertaining to my previous comment about the potential of cosplay, some of what I saw (the cartographer, musketeer, shaman, ???) looked really intriguing for that purpose. I'm in no hurry, soonest I could do anything would be PAX Prime, but yeah, thinking in general. Thanks! And of course congratulations! I am eager to see what you guys produce, and to help test it! Congrats and can't wait to play the game!!! I would love to get a desktop wallpaper of Delver's Drop to tide me over until the game releases. I think others would want a desktop wallpaper as well! I need one!!! right now my desktop is just plain blue! it needs some delvers drop desktop wallpaper love! Congratulations Pixelscopic! You should hit us up with some regular dev blog videos and concept art and such! I know i'd love to see it all! Congrats, we finally got the 100 rooms!! :)) @David Isaac I think what you mean is it doesn't have as much "content." But these are 2 different companies :/ and it doesn't at all reflect their passion by any means. Although I DO plan to back torment for $75 as opposed to the $50 here lolll. Gratz! Now go sleep, you have lots of work to do :) Congrats, and good night! Congrats all! :D Looking forward to a wonderful future for PixelScopic! :) $150,000! Cha-ching! Congratulations on $150K, Pixelscopic! More than 200% funded! You deserve it! Grats @Pixelscopic! $150,000+ pledged and over 4500 backers. Bravo! Can't wait for the game! Congratulations kickstarter and Pixelscopic!!! We did it! And done. Now the work begins, good luck! WHOOO! Congratulations. But I have, regardless. I will now madly chew my nails for the last 11 minutes as I waffle like a latka I can't belive I backed this at $50 just now. This is very stupid of me. I really shouldn't. This is not worth $30 more to me than Numaria Torment Woot PUZZLE ROOMS! Strange. The amount is dropping. @Faux Thanks for the quick response, though I then noticed it was actually answered all the way at the bottom of the first page though specifically addressing the $50 tier. Cool stuff! Upped my pledge a bit more =D @Kyle Manley: Yep! Someone asked that earlier and I happened to see their reply. Might be too late to ask this, or maybe it has already been answered, don't really have time to look. Do the "All Previous Rewards" include the 2 copy tier, that is, on the $40 tiers and above, do we get the two copies from the $30 tier? Everyone give $5,000 through PayPal at the same time so we all get Icarian Wings! Over 4500 backers and $150,000 raised! Congratulations! Can't wait to get my hands on this game. Here's hoping we push past those last couple of stretch goals with the PayPal donations! Ok guys..... next stretch goal - expansion! Come on 1k per minute xD!! Grats :D Congratulations on 150K Labyrinth Map stretch goal unlock!! I knew we would make it before this KickStarter was over! ^ ^ $150,000!!! How long have you guys been working on this game? I think I heard about it years ago when I was looking for a roguelike, I went to go "like" the facebook page when this campaign started but I found out that I'd already liked it from before. I'm a hipster, liked Delver's Drop before it was cool! Congrats! We broke 150 k woot! You guys are so close to the 150k mark! Congratulations!!! @nin Nice, I'm getting 5 lined up for when we hit 150k. Also, I'd like to say that this is one of the best put together KS I've seen, as far as pitch, and update content, spelling out the game world, and the various features. That really makes the difference in drawing people in! @Richard - I'm already mildly lit, but it's vacation week, so I'll gladly have a few more. :) @ nin Shot? Shot? :) Based on what they said on the stream, the PP will run until after PAX, and surely those folks will generate 2K. But I'd still like to knock it out tonight, just to celebrate! Plus over $500 in paypal last I heard. So only 2.2K! Go "The Huntsman" we need him :). 1.5 hours to make $3,037 we can do it. We are going to make 150K! I can feel it! Wish I could watch the livestream, but at work. -_- $3800! Check those cushions! go go go go go go go go go go go go go... heh, too close <url>#8 Limited Edition Backer Exclusive -- Only available for our LAST week of Kickstarter. from Kingdom Death : Monster Appeared randomly on pledge section Black Friday Launch Special! - The Game – At this level, you’ll receive the Kingdom Death: Monster boxed game! You will also receive the digital art book.(ps this was not made on an actual black Friday) From Wasteland 2, Kingdom Death : Monster, Planetary Annihilation Free wallpapers and/or icons in between updates. a friend of mine wants to pledge but is in Belgium and has a Maestro card. Apparently paypal isn't cooperating. Has anyone figured a pretty good pre-paid card that'd work in it's place? @Pixelscopic give me a minute, i'm writing something out. @finallyanime soft voice OP @Blue-demon thanks :) means a lot bro. @finallyanime here sir take my like and comment. hint 4th @Pixelscopic maybe some last minute sales can bring people in. i seen other projects like Ouya and Kingdom Death : Monster post last minute pledges. okay. everyone up by 2 or $3 and we're good. And there's 140.. so close..... This'll be the last time I post any links I promise, but upvote this Reddit if you're in the mood! It's at the top of the kickstarter Reddit, but only barely - <url>#/art/Delvers-Drop-Fan-Art-Character-359130704?_sid=52a10b0f $140.000!!! I wouldn't expect paypal to go far over 3-10k. I know we still have 10 hours to go, but I'm also really anxious to see how much paypal donations we get as well. May definitely some more stretch goals! Come on pledges pierce the heavens. Kickstarter's Last Call!! Delver/s Drop: Next 'Indie Zelda' --- <url>"catch-up" which never really works haha. (Legend of Dragoon, Chrono Cross, etc etc) 16.2k more to go for the next goal!!! Is that "100 room labyrinth" really 100 rooms? Or is that more of a title? 67K in 20 hours! GO GO GO GO GO GO! Yeah I'm mildly hyper tonight xD Also, FYI. For distribution you should look at Steam, GOG, Humble Store (they have a cool widget you can have on your site), Amazon, etc. pledges* Do Paypal pledge contribute to the Stretch goals as well? Increased my pledge in the hopes that we make it to the 100 murderous puzzle mode levels! And also because for a brief moment I thought "Icarian Wings" was a reference to Grandia on the saturn, one of my favorite things ever, and for that fleeting moment you guys got SO many temporary brownie points! I was planning to buy this game when it's released. But when I read about Delver's Drop in RPS and saw in KS it almost reach 2 player co-op (about 129800), I knew I want this game right away. Kudos to developer for creating local co-op, it's a rare feature in (pc) game. And, please make it like Tails supporting Sonic. ;-) Along with belief we need action -- tweet..tweet. You know the bird bird bird...the bird is the wo~ ok ill stop BUT seriously, try to do a search for Delver's on Reddit and just start upvoting. We all play a part & we're quite close. If "race the sun" (SWEET KickStarter) could make an almost impossible gain, we can because it's quite possible already :) lets do it! @Pixelscopic-RB, we believe in you! Go for the gold! Other exclamations of support! :D @Pixelscopic now that we are under the 24h mark before the kickstarter ends, can we get an update with details about how each character is different then the other? also including the kickstarter only class. And by stretch goals, I mean Stretch goals that haven't been achieved yet. Will the stretch goals still be worked on as additional patches/DLC post-release? @Pixelscopic Thanks for answering my question the other day. Also congrats on hitting the $130,000 mark. @finallyanime I'm pretty sure we would rather you be alive and well and make it up with reprisal (restitution). You must live with your mistakes and face them not run away from them. Or I guess if you prefer the more traditional way... then maybe I should say you don't deserve to commit seppuku? (Thats a bit harsh) It's official: I'm an idiot lol just checked out th chart before you posted. You guys must hate me by now. it's TOO LATE!!! I MUST COMMIT SEPPUKU. I BRING DISHONOR!!! Ok Whatsbthis about alpha?? I looked and I didn't see anything regarding alpha....lemme check again. I'd love to get access for the website. Definitely good press. Where's this accursed alpha? Can't wait to see us hit another stretch goal! Its a bit of a stretch, but we can make it! By the way, how will updates on progress be posted after the kick-starter has ended? Are there plans to open up a forum or anything of the sort shortly after? @Pixelscopic Thank you for the explanation. Has "true" 2 Delver Co-Op mode been considered for infinite drop mode? (Or whatever the mode Northernlion was playing is called.) I agree that for campaign mode you would have to design everything around two players, but for that simple score attack mode I think it would be fine to just have two people go through it. Yes, it would be easier than with only one person, but that's kind of ok for co-op in my opinion. Especially if the number of item and health drops remains around the same... and if being reckless with physics can bite you (or your friend) in the rear. Maybe a simple boost in the number of mobs if you think some difficulty compensation is needed. PS: Congratz on 130k! :3 If you think the original Legend of Zelda was "awful", you did not grow up in the 80s. Man, seeing this game reminds me of Link to the Past and the similarly designed 2D Zeldas. Original was awful. Sequel was ...let's just act like it never happened. Oracle of Seasons and Ages were OK but incoherent. Link's Awakening was also incoherent. (as in, it's hard to guess what you're supposed to do next) Minish Cap, I had fun but it was forgettable. Four Swords, played it so much! I can't believe Nintendo ditched 2D and went with whatever Phantom Hourglass was supposed to do. I can't stand Spirit Tracks and Phantom Hourglass. They seem like extremely forgettable games and I can't find any entertainment in playing past the first dungeon. ...Er yeah anyway...I'm really happy for this game. i'm glad t know that my calculations were wrong but in a good way. Congartulations on 130K and companion mode unlock! Onwards to the 150K Labyrinth Map unlock! We can do it!! Congratz on 130k! Only 20 k more to go in 29 hours :). Grats on 130k!!!! Keep up the great work guys! Grats on the 130K!!! Your success really made me want to start something of my own! Thanks! Grats on 130k. I think we can make it to 150k at this rate. Love what I have seen so far and I'm looking forward to playing. I do wonder about contributing a name and how it is going to be done. What's the process there? As a side question, if more than one backer submits the same name, would that name only go in one time or would it go in once for each backer? Put another way, if the name pool is 1000 names and 5 people submitted "Foo" does that mean "Foo" gets a 1 in 1000 chance or a 5 in 1000 chance of being the randomly selected name? Not that it matters in the grand scheme, I'm just curious. $600 away from a new goal! Keep pushing! Thanks for being polite about the criticism. I know you guys are trying your hardest to make sure everything works out best for all parties involved. I felt that honesty was needed in place of brevity on my part, even at the expense of sounding curt. Thank you for your consideration. I figured as much, making online mode for a game is a costly and time consuming part of development after all haha. So I take it there will not be online multiplayer and any co-op/competitive multiplayer will be local, correct? Just wondering, I still plan to follow through on my $30 pledge, it'd just be the icing on the cake. Glad to see your KS is doing so well. @Pixelscopic - You guys are amazing! I upped my pledge back to $50! :) You should make this an official announcement then. I would bet a large portion of the community does not know about this and would be upset once their pledges are locked in place. They might not change their minds about their pledge, but it would be a good show of faith to let them know about what's ahead. I think the sharing with friends is probably the best solution to problem, I agree. But I don't think sweeping this issue under the rug is going to warrant them good PR. Honesty and forthrightness is the only way to retain a good relationship with your customers. Pre-order bonuses are bad because they basically tell me "don't buy or game any time later". Think of all the people that find out too late about your game when the kickstarter is already over (or people who don't have credit cards). The exclusive content is a bit of a non-obvious pitfall, so don't worry. The sharing with friends is a good suggestion. @Boo please show us how these flyers look like. Great idea. @Blue-demon: I think there are two controversies surrounding the exclusive content: 1. It's giving some people an extra class, meaning it will change the gameplay and not just the aesthetics based on the idea of $35 DLC in a $15 game. 2. The content is NOT exclusive to kickstarter backers and will be distributed to other players upon release in a somewhat vague manner. I think they really aren't too bad, either way. I do think, however, that not making an official update regarding this issue will come back to bite Pixelscopic. They have 700+ people who may not know that their $50 is not buying them exclusivity. Done AND done! Happy to back this project. Lets hit that 150k. You have some great backers from reading these comments. I'm curious about the multiplayer set-up part, will there be support for keyboard + gamepad, 2 keyboards or just 2 gamepads. I just backed the project. Looks amazing. I can not wait for the final product. Also, I must say the tiers are very generous, thanks so much! FINE! Take my money! A lot of folks have recommended this game and it just looks too darn cute to pass up. @Boo Good luck! @Boo you have a heart of gold, good luck @finallyanime I'm glad about the adding friends part but facebook is the only social website that i use, I'm not a forum person,I don't use Twitter, I don't join larger ammounts of website. Yea i'm not a big fan of facebook eather but its the only place i know that i keep in touch with other people i met from time to time. Only other alternative is skype. @Pixelscopic Please do not worry too much about the kickstarter content, just look at it as a form of pre-ordering like any other game out there. You will also encounter people who will try to persuade you into getting the most free stuff out of you, I'm not trying to make them sound evil but keep in mind that you don't hear people complain much about pre-order bonus content. As Damian Jepson said "my understanding is that we pledge money through Kickstarter to help a project in return receive something exclusive that sets us of from the rest for doing so and getting in early". I made small pamphlets and today I'm going to give them away at the local mall wish me luck guys :D Starting the day strong going into the last 2 days! Now is the time to spread the word if you haven't already! @Damian Jepson I always saw Kickstarter as a way to help people make what they want to make: In Return For Helping Us Make Our Dream Games, We Will Give Certain Incentives. It's not about getting unique content that will only go to the 4-5 thousand of us who fund the project, it's about helping people create stuff we'd like to have. @Damian Jepson I agree with you. Is the game able to be modded or changed in any way? @Damian Jepson I agree for the most part, but for example i was in the hospital a while ago and coincidentally a reallyyyyyy nice kickstarter (Rival Threads) was going on and I didn't have a chance to back them so I kind of was upset about that at the time. But I know we're talking about something different @Blue-demon ....well actually i was asking cuz I wanting to add you to my list...but...yeah...I just want something where I can put interesting people in one list and I can keep up with what kickstarter's they're with instead of bookmarking every ridiculous time. @anthony I think we can do it! I agree with @RocK_M, it's far too soon to give on the 150K stretch goal! The last 2 days are often the biggest and if you do a live-stream it could gain even more traction. I don't quite understand the fuss about the exclusive content, my understanding is that we pledge money through Kickstarter to help a project in return receive something exclusive that sets us of from the rest for doing so and getting in early. If people don't pledge then they aren't entitled to the reward otherwise it makes the point of Kickstarter abit pointless. Giving up at 150k? Defeatist attitude I say! I want that 200K Stretch Goal! Lets get those extras stages and characters folks! xD @finallyanime there is feature for that, like that, this is not a social networking service. I'm gonna campaign so hard for Delver's in these last hours! 100 ROOM PUZZLE ADD-ON HOOOOOO!!! P.S. vote-UP ALL Delver's Drop reddits you can find and comment!!! @Blue-demon I meant like something akin to clicking and just adding someone. not via Facebook...I hate Facebook atm...I've hated fb integration ever since I heard it actually lol. @Faux Shizzle: Oh, I know there's usually a high spike of pledges in the last 48 hours of a kickstarter (backed over 40 of the addictive little buggers so far.. heh), which is why I said there's a slim chance.. it's going to be close either way. I really hope we can make the $150,000 goal, I just upgraded my pledge to $50 because this looks like the best game I have ever seen on Kickstarter. @Koshinator At the current 'linear' rate I suspect we would hit around 135-140k. Though of course there may be an even bigger surge in the last 24 hours.. After all the reminder works at 48 hours. @Ryan Gilmore - That interests me as well. I'm a little puzzled by what "exclusive" means in this particular case. Also, I didn't see any notice of the announcement that all digital KickStarter exclusive items will eventually be distributed to the rest of the community. Is that going to be addressed here at some point soon? We're closing in on the end and I don't think everyone is aware of that situation. <url>— Some Classes and many items will have requirements that must be met before they can be found. update #7 Gods forbid, if circumstances don't work out that the expansions are covered by the kickstarter + paypal, I would totally pay money for them, especially the puzzle rooms. Or even pay money for more classes if a full expansion isn't in the cards. Oh and i want those 100+ puzzle rooms too!!!! @Boo @Pixelscopic I think unlocking classes would be a good idea. Not with ridiculous requirements of course, but doing something substantial to get them except for the exclusive classes perhaps. @everyone did anyone figure out how to add or follow people on here w/out fb? Idk WHY kickstarter did that....seriously. People can even have friends on forums and there's almost no point except it being a list to remind you who you think's cool. Ugh, kickstarter, i love you, but hate you that that lol. Do we have to unlock the classes? Or do we start with all of them? P.s. I think unlocking them will make it a little more exciting. First Kickstarter campaign I back, got here thanks to the Binding of Isaac, hope this game becomes even better than BOI :D Also a few questions/suggestions: -As VacantPsalm asked (quote): 3. If we provide a name that turns out to already be on the list, do we get a redo or is it waisted? -I think you considered a permadeth feature, I think it can improve replayability, giving a more hardcore experience, so that if you get stuck because of not having bombs or something (like you have mentioned below) then you are screwed and you cant trigger that suicide feature. Maybe it could be one of the achievements, for true hardcore gaming experience xP -Please do the labyrinth 100 rooms when possible, want it so badly!! :D I would love to see us hit the co-op stretch goal. It sounds fun! Zomgzors really wanna get that hoodie... but 2 thousand dollars is a bit over the budget lol! Maybe upgrade to the 1k one... super excited about this... cannot wait to have it come to ios Banana peel as an item = win :D As someone was talking about Torment, it's intresting to compare to Delver's Drop. Torment is a game by industry veterans and pretty much a safe bet if you like any previous game based on D&D. Their style of work is already known for years and that's why people pledge. Delver's Drop is a piece by an aspiring studio that has to show what it's capable of. Pixelscopic is judged much harsher because there isn't something like a predecessor of Delver's Drop. Pledges are soley based on how much one likes the idea or on the game's current progress as opposed to Torment which can catch people by its name alone. One pledges money to support the rise of a studio and see what they can pull off. Let's hope that my pre-paid card gets delieverd (kind of difficult to use credit card payment only around here) before your campaign ends, so that I can throw more money at you. ^^ Also some quick questions people asked me ( when I went out agressively promoting your game): -Is your logo a nod to zelda? -The paralax scroll of the walls is nice, did you ever think about adding that to the drop that leads to the next room as well? -Don't-range based classes have an advantage over melee-based ones (especially when it comes to puzzles) -Can you get stuck in story mode? -Can darkness affect monsters? @Pixelscopic: Me too, I'm anxious for the release. So it's good that I can read up on it in anticipation. Updates answered my previous question, haha. Previous question was just answered by the updates, haha. @Blue- demon: Oh thank you, haha. I should read all the updates before asking Q's. ^-^' @Pixelscopic: Yes, that pointed me in the right direction. Thank you very much. Though, still curious, will the ability charge over time, a bit per every kill, or by each room? Dumb question: is there a way to add friends or follow people on here? I see a fb thing...but can you just straight-up follow a profile? Couple people on here who seem pretty cool...well all of you seem pretty cool to be honest I don't know how someone can not back this game. This game is 100% awesome eye-candy and it looks like it plays awesome, And now multiplayer! this team is making gold in style. Gratz on the multiplayer! I said I'd back if you reached this tier. The co-op option would be fairly awesome too, now we have reached this far! So much quality here. I second that! Another live stream is a great idea! Is there another live stream planned before the campaign ends? The last few hours can bring up a tremendous boost if you got something to fire up the hype. @RocK_M only 84K now! ;) Come on folks! we only need 90k in 3 days! Lets get those extra expansions! xD @Sebastian Helton Huntsman — Longbow Templar — Spear DeathDealer — Katana Bard — Instruments Shaman — Whip Cleric — Flail Murkromancer — ??? Update #7 Few Qs about the add a character name thingy. 1: Can it be a first + last if it is within X amount of characters? I know what name I want to use, but just the first name would be a bit too generic. (It's an NPC in a D&D game I run.) 2: Does it have to be original, or could it be a name that is obviously (or unobviously?) from something else? (e.g. Yuna, Sakuya, Samus, Error, Aragorn, or Hercule Poirot.) 3. If we provide a name that turns out to already be on the list, do we get a redo or is it waisted? I wonder if the classes will be like: Magic based Physical based Skill based? Then hybrid with, Magic/skill Skill/physical Physical/magical? And secret class being the balance between all categories? That'd be nice. I hope we'll see some concept art for the other classes sometime soon. I'd say there's ample material for cosplay here. @Pixelscopic Are you guys going to be at comic con? Also congrats on the $115,000 I honestly didn't think it would get this far but I'm super glad it did. :) I just posted a new post/article on Delver's Drop on my site: <url>~ Multi-player stretch goal reached! Congratulations! Very sad panda to see that Ouya buyers won't be able to alpha and beta test in June. Any hopes of reversing stance on this? Apologies if this has been covered already. In keeping with true KS gaming spirit we all crosspledge like crazy on other projects (some more then others...) So feel free to check my topic and decide yourself if others are worthy; <url>#15 for more details. <url>"do you send each backer one code for each supported platform, or do you send backers a code for a single platform they choose?" This isn't a big issue for me, I'm just curious. I'd kinda like to play on my tablet between lectures. @finallyanime Honestly i stoped doing Kickster projects because i was going broke but in a good way since its for a good cause. just look at all the projects i backed(not trying to smack talk or anything like that). Yea i would like a companion of sorts, maybe this summon can lead me to treasure, help me solve hard puzzles, buff my stats or even fight along side me. I just want a more utility class in game since sometimes i know ill be playing the game just to goof off but at the same time have fun while playing. @Blue-demon that'd be pretty epic! Like 3-5 minute long summons! They'd be like semi-rare and rare items :) btw I just wanna add you know your kickstarter is hella successful when more people are pledging for $50 than $25 even though both tiers are amazing lol. I admit, I defected over to the $50 darkside too lol. Instead of Red Lobster a couple times a week, I'll feast my eyes on the artwork lol @Pixelscopic I may have missed something obvious, but I was wondering when and how the character class voting will take place. @Blue-demon I was thinking the same thing :P @Boo Do it, that way we can have more classes. which brings me to a question @ Pixelscopic any chance that we will have an item or class that allows us to summon creatures to aid us in our quest? If one day I win the lottery I'm donating half of it to Pixelscopic. :D @Pixelscopic, this clarifies the subject, thank you. Can someone points me to the update or at URL that describes what are Excluse in-game "kickstarter items" and why there are different packs? Thanks. @Blue-demon I really don't think people would see it like that as they've said online is a hard endeavor. Extra money is logical. I mean look at skullgirls on indiegogo, they're well over 300k for asking for money for DLC. Same idea. I look at it like this: would you rather play this wonderful game by yourself primarily and not pay more than you already have...or play online and pay for an option that probably wouldn't have happened otherwise. Although I do see what you're saying about gold-digging and it is a valid point. I'm sure to some who might have given every last penny they could might feel a bit weird or otherwise. Idk I guess we'll see. I know Pixelscopic is probably getting tired of commenting about it so I don't expect any reply further regarding online, but naturally it's nice to get your cake & eat it...with others loll @Pixelscopic oh i do know that, i been reading your posts. in regards to numerous requests/concerns people have here in the comments and your responses towards it. "we might keep making more content / modes / expansions / etc for the game" this line pretty much answer most of the questions i had or any future questions that i might have. This line was said several times and its understandable. You guys are not some AAA game company who have millions and millions of dollars and people. More features = to serious work that your team has to put in. You also have to think of how people will react to in the open market. When the game gets release and you get constant requests for more stuff put in the game you will come to a point were you have to average more content with budget and honestly not everyone will be satisfied with the end result. This project looks amazing! Can't wait to play it! Just backed another awesome project too, a fantasy multiplayer game <url>"local multiplayer", so everyone will have to be in the same room. In for my copy! Lets see that $115k stretch goal come to fruition. How will multiplayer work? Is it like you host a party and people use your ip n stuff to find it or will you guys host a server for easier access? Also will multiplayer be crossplatform? Hello Pixels!!! Congratulations on this awesome game, Congrats! We are small game studio from Brazil trying the same road as you, a little bumpy road with a beautiful view, so, good vibes from Brazil for you all guys! Go go!!! See ya! I'm really happy to see that funding has started to really increase lately. I was wondering why more people weren't throwing money at this. I guess it just needed more exposure! Something I would LOVE to see would be a map editor. Being able to play the campaign in coop would be something I'd really like. Just a thought. Ross that's how I came by this gem. I had never even heard of Delver's Drop until just recently with ENB's vid and Joystiq proclaiming how Delver's Drop met their goal. I'm excited to see how this turns out. hey, not sure if anyone else has mentioned already but pretty sure a good few backers in the last few days have been sent your way by EpicNameBro on youtube - here's the link! <url>"alive..?" That infernal thing is still like $200 isn't it? Like 250? Idk...if it were $150 I'd think about it. Anyways, it'd be a great platform for DD Hello Pixelscopic, Do you guys plan on being at E3 This year with an early alpha build to display and maybe get a hands on? Wow! You guys are on fire! First stretch goal reached! 150K stretch goal is a definite possibility! I'd LOVE to see this on the 3DS. Mainly because I don't own any other consoles in the list, but STILL. It'd go we'll with my Shiren the Wandered card. Both the 3DS and Vita sound great, actually! This game would rock on a 3DS XL and Vita screen! @Pixelscopic Yeah I just didn't want to post anything cuz I saw someone else do so, but didn't know if they had the greenlight. P.S. yay I bumped up pledge from $25 to $50 :) if you changed your pledge around a couple times, I'm assuming they'll just charge the pledge you're on when it's over and not add them separately right lol Upped to the all Digital pledge. May up it again to get the T-shirt and physical copy before the campaign is done. @Jeritza Goris: That's the stretch goal for 240k or for much later if the game does well. I'd love to see this game on an actual console. Gameplay looks vibrant, clean, and something I could see many people enjoying. Any chance of it going to PSN, Nintendo eShop, or XBLM? Only $120 bucks to the first stretch goal! Anybody know any Linux users? Get the word out to em! I'm just wondering, does backing grant me a copy of the OUYA version? $115K needs to happen! C'mon! I do wish we meet that last stretch goal, but I am quite content with it getting funded and it coming so seemingly quickly. Congrats! Tell your friends guys let's make this game a legend :D I've been pushing this on my gamer friends for the past week or so. I at least wanna make sure you guys hit the 100k mark. New article about your Kickstarter success on Pocketgamer.co.uk! <url>#13. (My head canon was correct, yay!) Question was not pointless though, all classes in both genders? Awesome. I love the art, more of it is always better. :3 Also, for those interested, apparently Northernlion is going to be doing a live show here in a bit with more Delver's Drop. (And some Dark Souls if you want to see that too.) Link: <url>"contribute a class name", I am assuming this is a typo and should be character name as is true in the $40 tier or that will be a lot of classes xD Game is looking awesome :) I have sort of a dumb question: for the $100k stretch goal mark, is this the same class offered from the $50 reward tier w/the "kickstarter only" class or are these 2 unique classes...? Oh and I think we're gonna reach the goal before the end of the day! *chants to self in corner w/Golem voice* "MUST REACH WARRIORS GUILD & COMPANION CONJURED....Muusssstttt reaches itssss" Wow, $1549 to go! So close now! Daaaamn! 73K!! I hope we reach the goal by the end of the day! I agree that getting this out to as many streamers as possible is a good idea. This will likely become the type of game that people will watch as much as they will play (like BoI). And since even in this very limited pre-alpha build the game is very visually appealing, I think it will likely appeal quite a lot to those who watch games. I've got a list of popular streamers that I really think you guys should push your current build out to. I firmly believe that this would give you a final epic push towards the goal. Backed after ENB's video. Beautiful project. Backed after watching Northernlion play. Didn't know about it before, but super excited now! Very excited about getting my hands on this game. Hopefully every backer will have an option to get a steam key when this game gets greenlighted. I also have a question for the developers... When I was looking at the trailer, when the character hits objects and enemies they all seem to slide off giving the game a slippery and floaty feel. Is this intentional? Having this mechanic are you guys going to ensure the physics are going to be as responsive and accurate as possible? Other than that the trailer convinced me to fund this project @ Pixelscopic I do like the game in general, I as an individual liked said features/content more then the others. I do hope most if not all the stretch goals get archived so that the game will come out nice. There's nothing stopping you guys from doing another Kickstarter for some of your stretch goals. They're really good goals! Just want to say, this looks great and I really want to play it... NOW! Here's hoping you get across the line! @Pixelscopic I just found out about the project and as i skimmed through the remaining time in the project details the stretch goals got my attention. The stretch goals are very nice however i find myself liking the 3rd and 4th stretch goals(Warrior's Guild Formed and Companions Conjured) over the first two. I do not mean to sound negative but from the looks of it we might not be able to reach them, is it possible for you guys to set up a poll and have the community itself vote on what we would like first. Btw, I finally put up about half of the kickstarter material and badges to get people to pledge on my site - <url>"odd" time different from the first three, but yeah, the primary reason I mentioned the youtube is because with my site, I have to jump through numerous hoops to share other platforms besides youtube. P.S. Plus, it'd just be waaaayyyyy easier and would be sweet. @finallyanime but to your point, yes... a youtube (higher quality) option would be nice as well... :D @finallyanime i was on justin.tv, and completely missed the individual videos... if you look at the thumbnails below, on this link <url>"gold" or "special" randomized weapons with special effects? Not necessarily rarity tiers (if so that's cool), but your really cool weps you find from time to time like those red boxes in phantasy star online that made your heart jump when you saw it Just wondering cuz I can't imagine a dungeon crawler w/out some epic loot! Btw I just read the gameplay feature and I see weps are visibly reflected, but armor is not. It makes me a sad panda, but still at least something shows :) P.s. I agree Doomspeaker I'm worried a bit about the exclusivity of a whole class. It just irks me to not get the full game just because I don't have enough money now. The possible chance og getting it from other people does not see to reliant either. Anyway I threw in as much as I can for now, because your project looks amazing. You alread got me on board with "top-down rogue" like. Smooth physics and such gorgeous lighting feel like the icingin on the cake. Even moddable... I need to get more people onto this and pledge more. Best of luck with further development! Just curious, does visual appearance change a little or a lot when you equip items??:) P.S. I SINCERELY hope this gets funded like 300% of what you guys need :) so beautiful This game is an updated piece of my childhood. Hope it reaches the goal!! I don't get why more people are not throwing money at this. This looks like such a great game! Thank goodness the budget went well in Feb. Scraped up enough money to move up to double the pledge. Over 50k now, looking good!!! @Quirken @Pixelscopic yeah I don't exactly have enough @ least atm for the $50 thing either. Just as long as I can maybe play it down the road or have to pay...idk. I get the exclusivity, but Id love to try it too & I'd hate to miss out if it's a favorite kind of mine. Definitely keep us updated. Anyways ill definitely be reviewing this like first thing! Ill post the review on my site along w/little updates for everyone to see. Of course not secret stuff, but you know :) This game is RIGHT up my alley and I can't believe I only learned about it now, less than two weeks before the deadline! (so thanks to David Hellman for tweeting his support) You guys should reach out to some major games news sites and see if they'd write a short article. I emailed Kotaku and Venus Patrol about it at least (the former since they'd written an article showing interest past September, and the latter cuz they're smart + stylish). Good luck!!! Grats on 45k. There's always a lull in the middle, so I think we'll be just fine hitting the mark. wow, exactly 45,000 for the past 30 seconds or so, was just waiting for it to tic up again lol I'm trying to spread the word at O'Reilly about this one. Got a lot of friends who enjoy games like this, and already got 1 pledge in. Every bit helps! I really hope this gets funded. I'm looking forward to playing it. @Christopher Campbell.... If you like consoles just make a Home Theater PC, hook up to your TV, and use xbox controllers with steam big picture. Bam, customizable, super powerful console. Great article about you guys on PocketGamers.co.uk ! <url>"variant" class, just my 2 cents on that. so I have noticed there are different in-game item packs for every level. Do you guys have any information on what kind of stuff they will contain, and what the difference are between the tiers. Any news on the iOS distribution yet? If the game were to be accepted on Steam, would you consider add Steam Cloud? That would be really great, and I might even consider pledging a lot more as that is a feature which seems to be missing in many RPG games on steam. Would Kickstarters terms allow the extra class to be a 'timed exclusive' of sorts? As in, everyone else could get it 3-6 months after launch (either free or paid DLC), but Kickstarterers would get it exclusively until then? I reaaaaally want as many classes as possible, but can't afford the $50 tier. Another option would be making the kickstarter-exclusive classes be variants of the existing classes (maybe different skill trees or slightly different weapons). That would fit the Kickstarter descriptions without making people like me feel like we were missing out on something cool. @Pixelscopic I'll just have to take your word for it, since the only option is to not believe what you say and withdraw the pledge. :) My worries come from how the game handles player death. Losing the gear may or may not be a critical issue, but at least the class level is saved, so the game will inevitably become easier as you play it - supposing that increasing class level has only positive consequences. If this promotes any sort of kamikaze-playstyle, where the player can conceivably be in a situation where death doesn't really matter, then it will pop out any tension that the game could create. I think the penalty for player death should be severe, so as to promote a more careful and thoughful approach to combat, penalizing the 'Diablo way of playing'. This of course needs a wide variety of methods that the player can apply to survive in the dungeon. About the Kickstarter-exclusive player class: How about releasing it as a free update after a set amount of time, say 6 or 12 months after the initial release? I upped my pledge I felt you're updates to be superb and I want to see the stretch goals made, kickstarter has definitely given me confidence back video game wise. Keep up the great work guys! This game reminds me a lot of the first Kain game and that intrigues me... The more information you release about the game, the less sure I feel about it. The only games I have kept playing over the decades are Civilization and roguelikes. I was very much hoping for a zelda-esque take on the roguelike concept, be it with physics if you that rocks your boat. I'm mainly worried that the game just isn't challenging enough without resorting to stuff like insta-death traps or tidal waves of monsters. Of course it's hard to judge the exact difficulty level based on the information we have about the game so far, but that's the impression I've been left with. Great Updates ... I hope the Game will be funded :) Very good Ideas for gameplay , level building... The randomization is like the Ancient Cave in Lufia! Go for it Guys :D Awesome artwork and the game looks fantastic. Really hope you reach your funding goal; best of luck. =oD I really like where the game is going and the gameplay aboit the whole thing. I realize that multiplayer/co-op would be difficult to add during initial release but it is something that my friends and I personally would enjoy. I am anxiously awaiting the early release builds to test out the game. Kyle Indep., MO Regarding the character class at the $50/60 range -- is this class ONLY available to backers at this level, or how does it work? That sounds like something that would be interesting to read, and might drum up some extra publicity! I prefer the tiles, since I find it easier to get a handle on what's going on at a glance. I have a friend who swears by the ASCII version. They're really the same thing under the hood. (The tiles version replaces the ascii symbols with fixed-sized tiles). Be prepared to be a bit confused by over-complicated controls; I recommend printing out a cheat sheet. The tiles version also lets you use the mouse for some things. My favorite thing about the game is picking up scrolls/potions with giberish names and having to use them to identify them (until you figure out which one is a scroll of identify). This often means horrible things will happen to you in the early game, likely causing death or worse ;) I'd be really interested in a blog post with the impressions of the Delver's Drop dev team :) I'd really recommend checking out Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup if you have a chance. I think you've got a great thing going with Delver's Drop as it is, but IMO Dungeon Crawl is kind of the game that defines roguelike to me. I definitely see some similar elements here (in particular, the not knowing what your items do before you use them. I really hope there might be items that actually hurt more than they help!), but don't really think of this as quite the same type of game. 51% congratz So you guys are aiming for a real-time Stone Soup, basically? Sounds good to me. It seems strange to me... this seems like the kind of game people see a screenshot and are already sold. I think the press coverage will help a lot! :) I keep checking this every day feeling nervous it might not get backed. This is one of the only things I've backed that I really really wanted to succeed but wasn't totaly sure it would. Maybe I just worry too much though, still has 19 days to go, haha. update look cool 50% and 1100+ backers... congrats! might we see some footage from Vision Con, or something new you may have prepared just for the campaign? :) thanks for your reply maybey something like what you did for the 50$ back but instead all the physical items with a hard cover book? I dont know how expensive that would be though and how relistic that would be can there be add on like for the hard cover book? because it would be a lot simpler for those who want the book but dont realy want to pay120$ On the side note im totaly perpared to pay 120 dollars if i have to you guys are the first I've ever backed! I'm link from the visioncon update :) how do you acsess closed beta? Also is ther going to be a art book ? becuase i would easily buy it for30$ game looks phenomanal 504 for you Congrats 50% funded, with 20 days to go! This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. as of 10:30 PM CST, sitting at 49.73%... not too shabby, hitting 50% with 21 days remaining in the campaign... :) GO GO GO!!! Let's do this~!! Just heard about the project today. Obviously I'm backing you guys! You guys are right on target; easily a third of funds come in during the last week or so. Looks awesome :) Backed :) Congratulations on 1,000 backers! @SommerEngineering They actually talked about that in their interview with TheARPGamer. You can listen to the interview below, but I think they said the focus would be almost entirely underworld/dungeons. <url>| Delver's Drop Interview) <url>"just" underworld / dungeons? :) Best would be (like e.g. Zelda - A Link to the Past) both... ;) I'm hoping it reaches at least 150K so we can get the Labyrinth Map puzzles, but really the 200K goal would be the most awesome with all of the additional classes and zones added! They'll make it for sure but it would be nice to get 125-150k but we really need some big exposure for that. Lets hope the youtube celeb's aren't done tweeting/covering just yet. ok, we're at 44% funding, with 24 days to go... the odds are certainly in your favor of reaching the objective, but obviously, blowing past it would be ideal... ;) media blitzes are in order! how about a new 5-10 minute gameplay session with the most recent client? lets rocket past 1,000 backers and get the second wind of the campaign going... :) Pete:Thanks for the clarification. Ouya does not play all "Android games". The console is based on Android, but just like the Kindle Fire it has its own store with zero access to the Google Play store. It will not play your existing Android games, so buying the Android "version" is not going to give you the Ouya "version" at the same time. I am glad to see at least a verbal commitment that this will happen. I think Are's idea (about pledge levels with 2 copies) is a great one. Will it be possible to reset your accumulated ranks/skills (or start a new character at level 1/or a new profile)? Say you want to start fresh, increase the challenge, or show the game to a new player. Hi again. Still a way to go, but I think you have a good chance. Have you considered additional tiers for multiple (two) copies of the game? Perhaps more backers would up their 15$ pledge if that was a possibility. fine* @Pete Cavenas any game made for the "android" market is already compatible with Ouya so there is no need to make another "Version" for it Will this game require an active internet connection ? you said that there is a number of different classes and that this is molded off of games like zelda it dose a wonderful job capturing that feel. I am however wondering is there a level/rank/skill system in place or is it like Zelda where you just get new items? ether way would be find also is there a way to customize your look? if your going to make it multilayer this would be nice... yes randomcitizenx it dose Doesn't Ouya play android games? In at just the backer level for now. I feel that this game would be perfect on Ouya. I read the comment below about making the game for Ouya, but if you officially commit to Ouya as a stretch goal I will certainly up my pledge! Thanks for responding :) Glad to hear that. Don't worry, I've been spreading the word online and off. Also, you guys seem to be having trouble with my name. There's only one "n" in "Bradson". ^_^ (It's okay, I forgive you.) I like the companion co-op. It reminds me of multi-player in Kirby Superstar (which is one of the greatest games ever created). If you're worried about balancing combat with drop-in second player assistance, you could borrow a page from old arcade games. Specifically, I'm thinking of the TMNT arcade game, which would just add health to the bosses when more than one player was present. Alternately, stuff could just be easier with two people. Isn't that really part of the fun of having a payer two? Knowing that you've got a power play going on as long as they're around. Also, while I'm blatantly cribbing from other games, Legend of Mana had a thing where if you got pwned but your monster familliar stayed up long enough you would recover. I remember having an epic fight with a dragon where I got floored, and then I waited anxiously as my rabbit hopped about evading massive damage with its single hit point. Getting up after the 30-second eternity and being able to finish the fight was incredible. So, some kind of timed revival mechanic is what I'm suggesting I think. I've never once played the "co-star" mode with another person in Mario Galaxy, even though I'm aware of its existence and it could have been an option. I've messed around with it by myself briefly, so I am familiar with what it is, and find it to be nothing more than a gimmick, or a slightly-involved spectator (if you had one person insistent on playing Mario and the other didn't want to just watch, it'd be a slight compromise) I'd just as soon see Delver's Drop not put effort into multiplayer at all than spend time doing this. (I'm not really interested in horde or deathmatch multiplayer, but I imagine those are comparatively easy to make) You could simply restrict the 2nd player from interacting with puzzles, but give them full (or near full) combat ability. If that messes with the combat balance... oh well. It would be better to have an unbalanced but fun co-op mode than a second player who was really a glorified spectator. I don't think this makes it a "cheat" mode as described in your update. If you won't do that, please at least consider some sort of hot-swap capability. I'm envisioning that the "main" player switches if he dies, and the person who had been controlling the summoned creatures now gets 1P position, and the former main-hero now gets to control the summons. In any case, thanks for the response. Will items and loot factor into puzzles and exploring? It's a staple of Zelda-ish series but how would it work with random dungeon generation? Thanks for the update. For Drop-in Co-op Companion Mode, I'd much rather the game difficulty increase correspondingly, rather than having a gimped co-op partner. I don't think playing co-op will be much fun if you don't get equal power between players (look at co-op in Fable 2... the second player was a generic henchmen, and it wasn't fun for player 2). So, I'd propose either it become more difficult. Either enemies have twice the health or damage potential, or players have less health. Or there could be more enemies, etc. There are plenty of ways you can make co-op viable without feeling like a tacked on gimmick. This wouldn't be a cheat mode. Maybe the experience would be somewhat different than playing single-player, but that's a good thing. If you're worried about achievements or something, you can always have it consider a game you co-oped in in a different category. This is one great looking project, congratulations! I wanted to say, I believe this has the potential to be pretty awesome, if only it manages to nail an adequate level of challenge. And by adequate, I actually mean rather high and uncompromising (within reason). Games like Spelunky , The Binding of Isaac or early Zeldas didn't exactly win our hearts by gently holding our hands, right? That said, keep up the good work! I'd love to see steam keys on this. I know that the game has to be greenlit first but I'd hate to see my Kickstarter rewards disappear when I play it on Steam. I'd hate to cancel my pledge if the Steam key doesn't get added in. After reading the second update, the 100 Room Labyrinth Puzzle Mode call my attention, maybe it could be produced as a DLC in the future because is brilliant! Also, I don't know if it is possible but unlock conept art, new costumes, characters or new itmes is a way to push the gamer to replay the game is like capcom does in their games. It's like "Oh, you finished your game, now take this costumes/upgrades and difficulties and play it again!" Joystiq picked up this Kickstarter, which I'm glad for; I'd forgotten about this game. And then I learned you guys were just SW of here. Looking forward to watching this one take shape! 1/3 of the way there! Hopefully knock out the initial goal in the first week and move on to the awesome stretch goals. Jest an idea- maybe setup something on the site where developers (like myself!) can sign up with their email address and name to receive updates on how the API will work and all that with modding of the game? Or receive some sample code to show how it would work? @ Mohammed we are to wild to be contained all shall taste our fury!! ahem I need a drink :P @Ciper: Damn, all these Wildmen everywhere I go :D Hahaha. I really thought the same as well, if we're gonna have different classes, that could enhance the replayability. Damn, I feel like we need to get this funded already! :D @PixelScopic: Could a we get some insider dev info about this game? What engine (if any) is this based on, and will mods be supported (as a stretch goal, or something) ? @ Pixelscopic thanks for the response I'm encouraged by it and cant wait to see what you have in store. The issue i have with a lot of arpgs is that story and setting get treated as an afterthought if they bother with it at all. @ Pixelscopic i'm really interested in the story elements and how classes interact (if any) killing and looting are fun but can get old fast for me borderlands 1 was a good example hardly any rpg in that and to much trash loot. What are your ideas to counter that with your game? Hi all I just backed this project. I'm hoping to help as much as i can. some of my battle brothers from wildman are here so in turn i am here I agree with Steve. Maybe trying to contact well known games websites to promote the game. This has the potential to be a very good game, I think. The only element that I can see as a pitfall would be the difficulty level. You mentioned rogue-like a couple times in the video, does that describe the general difficulty of the game? I think games like these need to be beyond merciless, or the gamers won't respect the experience. Being able to save some cosmetic stuff is ok, if the game is more difficult to master than Nethack. That doesn't prohibit some kind of easy mode that (for example) doesn't record scores to the main scoreboard. Having said that, the difficulty always needs to be reasonable. In every good rogue-like, I die because I played in a stupid manner, not because the game has insta-death lottery around every corner. Even then, the player should regret their last choices and think, "I would have survived, if I had done [this and that] instead". Being able to mod the game is a major point of interest for me. I hope you give enough control to the modder that a game like Link to the Past (with physics) would be possible as a total conversion mod. @Pixelscopic... i realize we have 27 days left in the campaign (which is certainly an ample amount of time), but do you have any plans for any "media coverage", or other efforts which might drive more folks towards the site? Cant wait found this today and instantly backed it! Delver's Drop might be shooting up to Top-Sellers in the iOS store as soon as it launches, Bastion shot-up and still is among Top-Selling video games lists in the AppStore. No thank you. Ouya? This game looks fantastic and deserves more attention for your hard work and dedication! Best Wishes! @Pixelscopic: It's a bit hard to answer since it's been a while I played it. I guess it had to do with beating the "same" stuff over and over. I mean there are different items and bosses and all that, but every room is the same. Every level has the same elements. In any case I didn't feel compelled to play more. From what I gather, you have planned more variety than I saw in BoI, with puzzles, classes and such. Your game also look more action filled and pretty :) What I'm seeing looks great, guys. I just hope you'll manage to create enough content and replay value. The Binding of Isaac, which is a very similar game, was nice too, but it didn't last very long for me. Best wishes. @PixelScopic: Cool :D Thanks for clarifying. Also, you should really look at @Hammerwatch, both games seem similar (although, I'm kinda digging Delver Drop's artstyle). What's the length of the game gonna be like? Any plans on co-op? @Pixelscopic: responded to your message. I applaud you guys for really listening to the fans! I was extremely excited about alpha, and with all of this other information, I just get more and more excited about the project! Fantastic! I've switched to the Digital Deluxe tier which suits me perfectly but as a thank you for listening I've left my pledge at $65 ;) @Pixelscopic: You would need to go through Steam Greenlight, and if the community votes Delver's Drop enough, Valve will "greenlight" the game. I should add *on steam* So when this goes on sale at 20% off for its first week, how will everyone feel? Or when in a month or two it's at 50% off for a weekend? Been waiting for more info for this one! 25 for now, but will most likely up it in the near future. Reminds me of Binding of Isaac with a lot more depth, I'm excited, I hope this gets funded. Looking forward to your next update ;) As far as the exclusive content goes the least controversial way to go is make it backer exclusive for a limited time then released as a paid DLC for everyone else. Was turned onto your KS by a brother of a dev, looks sweet. $15 to you, as that's all I can really do right now. Good luck. Backed. You guys are pretty. I also REALLY like the site you guys made for Delver's Drop! Any chance I can get a site made by you guys like that? It's amazing! Originally $25, now a $41 contribution! Although not sure if I need that postcard... But good luck guys! I can't wait for some early beta access along with all the nice rewards you have to offer! Looks like such an epic game! -Michael I'd like some more information about the KS exclusives - I just hate dev's which offer KS exclusive items which is often just another name for cheat items (which ofcourse is always denied since saying that they are is even worse). - And an exclusive hero? That is even worse and will for sure make me unpledge if that stays the way it is. (currently $1) - Publishers which offer exclusive items when you preorder at X store or site is already horrible and despised by gamers everywhere so why KS dev's continue to do it I don't know... A lot of other KS dev's have resinded their initial idea of exclusive and made it available to all people or only cosmetic or a timed exclusive. I hope you will see the light aswell. -------- On the Ks itself; I hope you will create a few more tiers offering hardcover artbooks, unsigned posters and also create add-ons for those and other items aswell. Finally, A game that references the most underrated and most challenging dungeon crawler ever! Adventures of Lolo. You have my support! Good Luck! Game looks amazing. Wish you all the best @Pixelscopic. I believe that you guys are on the verge of something awesome. Although I'd suggest improving the music just a teeny bot. @Pixelscopic: Also check out Hammerwatch. Also looking forward to that :D Instant pledge! Awesome looking game! Looking forward to playing it and hoping all of the stretch goals are met! just surpassed $10,000... congrats guys!! this campaign is off to a fantastic start... :) I completely agree with Antony. Is there any thoughts to alpha access? Good luck guys. I hope you will consider adding an all digital mega tier. I don't take physical goods because postage to New Zealand is pretty steep. I'm currently pledging $65 for the $60 tier even tho I will be turning down the physical goods and there are still 2 levels of in-game items that I won't get (but would if I could). What a great game you have in the works there. Shame there is not alpha access. Also is this multiplayer? First Day and 1/9 are already in the pot. If it keeps that way the upcoming Days we should hit the Jackpot by the End of next Week :D This game looks excellent. Cannot wait to play it! Really hope we can get some multiplayer co-op in this game. Looking great either way though. I think I saw the game at PAX prime last year. If so, it makes me even happier that I chipped in some cash. I'm blown away with the progress you guys have made on this game! I wish I could throw my next 5 years worth of salary at you guys, but I kinda need to eat and pay lame bills. I've already spread the word on Facebook. I wish you guys all the best! The game's looking great and I can't wait to get it in my hands! <url>
