It’s o-fish-al! Thank you for making NoClean Aquariums™ a reality! If you missed out you can get your Self-Cleaning Aquarium at NoCleanAquariums.com, along with updates and future projects. We sincerely appreciate your support! -Craig & David NoClean Aquariums™... the Fastest, Easiest, Mess-Free & FUN way to have an Aquarium! People love aquariums because of their soothing, natural beauty. They make a stunning addition to any home or office and are great for kids. The only drawback is the cleaning. It’s a dirty, messy time consuming chore. So we set out to design an aquarium that breaks down these barriers so anyone can have a beautiful, fun-to-watch aquarium without the hassles. Introducing the NoClean Desktop Aquarium: It’s self-cleaning, eco-friendly, and only takes about 60-seconds to work! The self-cleaning system runs entirely on physics. Simply pour water into the aquarium and watch it clean itself! There's no need to remove the fish, ornaments or wash the gravel. Your hands won't even get wet. It’s so easy anybody can do it! The aquarium uses no electricity or filters so there are no running costs. Waste water is neatly collected in a cup making it easy to recycle as organic fertilizer for your plants. Now anybody can have a beautiful, fun to watch aquarium without the hassles! How it Works Due to gravity and the laws of physics, aquarium waste naturally works its way through the rocks to be trapped at the bottom of the aquarium in a patent-pending reservoir and plumbing system. This keeps your Betta fish out of harm’s way and water crystal clear. Every couple of days, simply pour clean water into the aquarium to activiate the self-cleaning system. This flushes out waste trapped in the reservoir while performing a partial water change. The system automatically stops when the water reaches the perfect level, ensuring a spill-free, mess-free experience. Waste water is neatly collected in a cup for watering your plants or easy disposal. This is clearly the easiest way to clean and maintain a healthy aquarium! About the Rewards The dimensions of the aquarium are 4.25" x 4.25 x 11.5" high. The aquarium body is made from sturdy 3/16” glass. The aquarium holds just over a half gallon and weighs about 4.5 pounds empty and 9.5 pounds full. The aquarium and its components (not LEDs) are made & assembled in the USA. Add allure to your reward with the Large Bright-White LED; including 3x AAA batteries (we recommend replacing with rechargables), and the Colored LED 4-pack; including 2x CR2032 batteries per light. All rewards that ship with lights receive a free light-hood. All aquariums come with your choice of clear glass gems or natural rocks. NoClean Aquariums™ "IOU" Gift Certificates are available for backers to print at home for those who give this as a gift before we ship in April. Betta Fish Care & Cleaning Tips Betta fish, also called “fighting fish” are loved for their beautiful flowing fins, vibrant colors and interactive nature. These unique qualities seem to draw in both fish fanatics and those who’ve never had fish before. Betta fish are low maintenance and easy to care for – especially when combined with the NoClean Desktop Aquarium – making them the perfect starter fish and great for kids! Betta fish are inexpensive to aquire and maintain. They are sold at most pet stores for between $7-$17. The only other items you'll need is a small net, water conditioner, Betta food (pellets), and a plant / decorations. With fighting fish a little food goes a long way. Feed your Betta a couple pellets once or twice a day. They can go a few days without eating so don't worry if you're away for a long weekend or leave your fish at the office. For a treat we recommend occasionally feeding your fish live food. Water quality is key to your Betta’s health. Therefore, you should run the cleaning system every couple of days. The water you add should be about the same temperature as the water present the aquarium. Use water conditioner when filling the aquarium. Rinse out the cup before you fill to avoid introducing toxic substances, including soap and cleansers, to your aquarium. Betta fish should not be kept in a cold room. Never put two Betta fish in the same aquarium. They’re called fighting fish for a reason! However, you can put two Betta tanks together for an entertaining show. This has the added benefit of giving your fighting fish some exercise. Just be sure to separate them when you’re done watching so they don’t get over-excited and stressed-out. Your Support is Essential Help us make our dream come true and change the aquarium world forever! Your support is essential in our quest to improve the lives of fish and their owners and enables us to design more beautiful and exciting aquarium products! The faster we have your support the larger our project will grow and the more impact your pledge will make on our progress. So please become a NoClean Aquariums™ backer and share this page with your friends today! Thanks! Making fresh, healthy salads is a chore no more! Our newest project, 60 Second Salad, takes the hassle out of rinsing and straining and allows you to chop the ingredients all at once! Our campaign ends today at 1:29pm CST and we would love your support! Please check out our campaign now! Hey all! THANK YOU for your generous past support of NoClean Aquariums. It's been a fast, hard working four years since we originally connected on Kickstarter. Because of YOU, we were able to start NoClean Aquariums to take the hassles out of enjoying fish! In case you haven’t heard, we recently launched a new, larger self-cleaning aquarium on Kickstarter! Please click here to get the story on GravityFlow2 and be sure to check out our FAST-ACTION specials. We hope you’ll choose to support us again, and are excited to begin production on these beautiful, glass self-cleaning aquariums as soon as we reach our goal. We would also love if you shared our project with your friends and family. Thanks for your continued support and enjoy the holidays! Craig &amp; David www.NoCleanAquariums.com If you have not received your aquarium or tracking number yet there is a chance it is already on route so please be on the lookout ! There has been a delay in us receiving the tracking numbers, however we will be all caught up in getting them distributed this weekend. We are expecting more aquariums at your door steps today. Thank you for your attention as we get this sorted! Craig and David Hey Backers- While many have received aquariums by now we are expecting to finalize shipping this week. We have been scrambling the last couple of days to organize and distribute all the tracking numbers to the proper people in good time, however, some aquariums managed to slip out the shipping dock before we were able to email the tracking info in time. In other words- please keep your eyes open for your package JUST IN CASE . On a warm note, as we head for winter some of you may want to consider an aquarium heater. The best one we’ve tested is the Marina C10 submersible Aquarium Heater. It has a built in thermostat to avoid overheating and has a red, indicator light so you know when it’s at work. Make sure to test the heater with a thermometer and without your Betta in the aquarium for at least a day to make sure it’s functioning properly. On a cool note, we would love to see your creative aquarium designs! Please send us photos. Remember, an aquarium with no decorations is like a house with no furniture. As you can imagine, lots of creativity can fit inside these aquatic habitats- with a little attention to fine detail and color usage your aquarium will be absolutely eye POPPING- especially with the LEDs! Feel free to post your pictures on our NoClean Aquariums Facebook page or email them to <email> with subject title “OH YEA TANK!”. We plan on creating a photo gallery on our website. It feel great to finally be shipping our product and will be back with another update soon- THANKS! Hey everyone- We are back with some great news! Today our warehouse sent us the picture below that filled our faces with gladness. Our new custom boxes boxes arrived at the warehouse today and survived a two story test fall onto a concrete floor. Your rewards are lined up waiting for the brown trucks and should all be shipped by Wednesday! Once you receive your NoClean Aquariums™ Self-Cleaning Betta Fish Tank please read the assembly instructions. Our friends and family were nice enough to proof read as well as provide us with some valuable feedback to help ensure the best possible aquarium experience for you! In the meantime, while waiting for reservoirs and boxes that fit, we've been busy creating some fabulous new aquatic products that we can't wait to share with you once we are ready. Going forward we should be able to move a lot quicker now that we have a great team in place and some experience under our belts. Many thanks again for all your patience, trust and support. We will be sure to keep you updated on anything newsworthy. Have a great weekend! -David and Craig Just when we thought we were in the clear Murphy's Law strikes again. Our custom boxes were not manufactured to specification and are not properly fitting your aquariums. This was a total shocker since the prototype boxes we approved (pictured in Update #13) literally fit like a glove. If we ship them in the defective boxes it will guarantee catastrophe since the top of the glass aquarium won’t have any padding and will rattle around inside the box. You can see the problem for yourself in the pictures below. The good news is that our box vendor is on top of the situation and rushing the correct boxes through production. We expect to have them shipped to the warehouse by the end of next week. We apologize for this very unexpected delay and will keep you posted as the situation unfolds. Other than that everything else is ready and waiting. To be continued... Hey everyone- The time has finally come that we've all been waiting for! That's right, we begin shipping your aquariums this week! Tomorrow morning we are meeting our warehouse to drop off all the pre-wrapped components that you will find inserted in your aquariums. These have already been separated by sku to make the pick and pack process as smooth as possible. We will have another update as soon as we know how many aquariums are expected to ship within the first couple of days and will keep you posted from there. Thanks again everyone! Great news! The sample reservoirs arrived today and they fit perfectly! As you can see from the pictures below, each large plastic sheet has been formed to comprise 16 reservoirs. The die acts like a super-sharp cookie cutter to "punch" out the reservoirs precisely and consistently. Now that we approved the sample we go into full die cutting production which takes about 10 working days. From there the reservoirs are shipped from the cutting facility in Massachusetts to our Chicagoland warehouse. The reservoirs and other wrapped components are then placed inside the glass for safe shipping in our custom made packaging. If all goes as expected, all aquariums will be shipped by the end of the month. We’re extremely happy to be this close to the finish line, and will keep you posted on our progress as we wrap up production! Hey Backers! We spoke with our die cutter today and have confirmation that our die will be completed on Friday. We’ll immediately get a sample of the die cut reservoir overnighted to us for inspection. This sample should arrive Monday. If needed, any revisions to the die are quick and easy. From the time we give our approval the cutting process should take about 10 business days. From there the finished pieces are shipped from the die cutting facility in MA to our Chicagoland warehouse. Once they arrive the reservoirs and other wrapped components are placed inside the glass for safe shipping in our custom made packaging. If all goes as planned we expect your aquarium to be shipped in about 4 weeks. We’ll post another update next week after we've inspected the reservoirs. Hey Backers! We have had an intense past three weeks. Here’s what's happening. We had our factory ship us another batch of reservoirs. To speed things up we shipped them Next Day Air only to have the package lost by the carrier. After they told us it could be up to 7 days until they found it we put in another rush order and had the parts a few days later. Incidentially, the original package has not yet been found. As we inspected the reservoirs we found many were cut with jagged edges. Supposedly the jagged edges occurred because we are using a thin and flexible piece of plastic for this part. Even though they functioned well we still feel they are unacceptable to ship as a finished product. Instead we are having them sent to a specialty die and CNC cutting shop that we met a couple weeks ago at the Chicago Design and Manufacturing show. We have a lot of confidence in this company. Obviously things like this slow us down and we're only as strong as our weakest link. We kept waiting for better news about the reservoir but felt it was time for an update. Nobody wants to get these aquariums shipped out more than us! Either way, it's great to learn from these experiences for when we produce our next self-cleaning aquarium. Here are some photos of our successes. The first picture shows some of the drilled and grommeted glass that we received from our assembly shop. These are the copper spouts we sourced and our custom injection molded inner spout tip. The spout tip regulates the flow of the cleaning so everything works fast, smooth and trouble-free. Here is a shot of the jig our factory designed to hand bend the tube. To accomplish this the acrylic tubing is heated, hand-pressed into shape and then cut. A metal spring is inserted inside the tube during bending so it keeps it's shape without collapsing. Here are a couple shots of the lid. The picture to the left is one of the original prototype lids we made ourselves by heating and forming a plastic sheet over Lego's. The center lid is the first production sample. You'll notice we shortened it bit and smoothed out the mold for our final production lid that you see to the right. We are waiting on the reservoir and once we see they are cut to our specifications we will be able to provide a solid ship date. After all, one lesson of this whole thing is to not provide a ship date until we are sure:) Thanks again everyone! Hello to all our Kickstarter Backers, the factory that’s producing the reservoirs had a huge job to run for another customer so progress and updates from the factory has been slow over the past two weeks. The wait has been agonizing but thankfully the job was completed yesterday and we had a very productive teleconference with the owner today. Within the next couple weeks the die will be ready and we'll have some freshly cut parts for us to test out. Everything else is lined up and waiting on these pieces. Assuming the die cut part fits we should have production parts in-house and expect to begin shipping before the end of July. We thought you’d like to know that we also made some great contacts at the Manufacturing and Design Expo here in Chicago last week. This means that going forward we have contacts that can make just about anything we could ever need and we will have backups in case of an emergency. Either way we know they will come in handy for our future aquarium building adventures which you all will be the first to know about! We’d also like to thank you again for the support you’ve shown us during this start-up process. It's certainly been nerve-racking at times and we really do appreciate your patience and understanding that you're participating in the birth of an idea, the start of a new project, the beginning of a new business. We will continue to pour our blood, sweat and tears into this project and have learned a tremendous amount about the new product development process of converting an idea into prototype and then a physical product reality. We have personally learned the definition of “Murphy’s Law”, which says that, “If anything can go wrong, it will!” We continue to invest the money we received through your sponsorship and far more than that from our own efforts and the efforts of those closely associated with our project. Again, let us just assure you that we are meeting every challenge head on. We have overcome each new obstacle as it has arisen and we will not stop until we deliver an awesome self-cleaning aquarium to your door. Yes, our time, effort and costs have exceeded our expectations, but you, and we, will be proud of the finished product. And you will be especially proud of your participation in getting this venture off the ground. For your continued trust and patience in us, we thank you. David and Craig Success! The last round of reservoirs came in this week and fit perfectly! We trimmed the height down a couple millimeters and used an even thinner, more flexible plastic that literally conforms to the aquarium walls and corners so it fits like a glove! We're thrilled with the new parts and know you’re gonna love your aquariums! It looks like we need a die made to cut the reservoirs exactly how we need them. This may take a couple of weeks but it's worth it get to get a top-quality product. We’ll have a better idea of the ETA after talking with the factory this week. We’re also happy to announce that a new and improved www.NoCleanAquariums.com is up and running and we finally have a logo! To check out your name go to our Kickstarter tab <url>“new” reservoirs back today. They’re very close but not a 100% fit. Thankfully, a slight mold modification should compensate for the difference and then we will be rolling. Please understand that we would not be going through all this trouble (and expense!) if we didn’t want to do our very best for you. And while we’re all eager to get these shipped ASAP, releasing a product that doesn’t meet our standards isn’t good for anybody in the long-run. We will be back with another update soon. Enjoy the holiday weekend! Craig &amp; David Hey Backers! The lid and another rendition of the reservoir arrived. Thankfully the lid fits perfectly and is in production. On the other hand the reservoir was slightly too big so we need the factory to slightly shave down the mold. The challenge is getting it to fit nice and snug without being too tight or loose on the walls and corners. We don’t anticipate the alteration taking long and because it’s a 16-cavity mold production time should be quick once everything is right. Because the change needed is very small and we feel the next sample production part will work we should be able to ship in May. While we’re all anxious to get these produced and delivered I think we can all agree that your aquarium deserves the time needed to make it right. As previously announced, the glass arrived to our fulfillment and assembly shop and the hole drilling for the copper spouts is underway. The grommets fit very tightly (which is very good!) and are installed by the assembly shop for your convenience. You’ll also be happy to know that we secured some beautiful, shiny copper spouts that give your production aquariums a nice upgraded look over the prototypes. Thanks again for hanging in there with us. The finished product will be worth it! Craig &amp; David Hey Backers! Wanted to let you know the glass is manufactured and on its way to our assembly shop. Packaging of the small aquarium components starts next week. These parts will be safely wrapped and ship inside of the aquarium. Because of a couple of setbacks we’re still waiting on the molds for two parts. The good news is that everything else will be ready to go so that when the final parts arrive the aquariums can ship right away. However, because of the delays we’re now looking at May shipping. Some things aren’t moving forward as quickly as planned and we admit we’re learning a lot along the way. We apologize for the delay and thank you for your patience and support as we manufacture our first product. Rest assured, we are doing everything we can to ship as quickly as possible and overall we’re in good shape. Craig &amp; David So here are the awesome new LED options you’ve been waiting for! Not only do we have a brand new colored LED option, but we’re also upgrading all Large Bright-White LED buyers to an improved version with optional remote control! Large Bright-RGB LED The RBG LED is just as large and bright as the White LED, but has 12 variations of RGB colors, plus two color-changing modes. You can cycle through the 6 of the colors and 1 color-changing mode using the button on the LED. To get all 12 color variations and 2 color-changing modes you’ll need the RGB remote. You’ll want the remote anyway because it’s fun, super-handy and will make the most of your setup. After all, who wants to get up and mess with the LED every time you want to change things up when you can just sit back, point &amp; click! It’s the NoClean Aquariums way! Plus, one RGB remote works with multiple RGB lights. So, if you have two aquariums sitting next to each other they are controlled with one remote. This makes it a snap to coordinate the color-changing modes so each aquarium changes to the same color at the same time, creating a nice, polished effect. These new LEDs are awesome for parties or just chilling out and can even be used as night lights. We highly recommend colored LED 4-pack backers message us to upgrade to the new Large Bright-RGB LED option! <url>’s just as bright but has a more attractive light pattern and can be operated with a remote control. The white remote can be added to any White LED for $7. Just like the RGB LED, the White LED runs on 3 AAAs and last about 8 hours. We recommend replacing with rechargeables. The remote uses a button cell and has a 7-10 foot range. One white remote works with multiple white lights, but the white LEDs do not work with the RGB remote, and the RGB LEDs don’t work with the white remotes. <url>’t recommend doing it because water can seep in and corrode them over time. Nevertheless, it’s nice to know that if a light does fall in just dry it well and you’ll be fine. <url>’re upgrading from another LED we’ll send a Paypal request for the difference in cost (if you don’t use Paypal we can make other arrangements). Here’s how it will work: Say you originally got the colored LED 4-pack ($13) and you want to upgrade to the new RGB LED ($22). Send us a message and we’ll update your order and send you a Paypal request for the difference in cost. In this case it would be $9. If you also wanted to add the RGB remote ($8) it would be $17 total. We’re planning on ordering the LEDs next week so if you want upgrades or additions please let us know by Monday so we can finalize the count and get the order in. From past experience we’re expecting lots of messages so please be patient because it may take a few days to respond. Thanks again for your support! -Craig &amp; David Hey Backers! This week we visited Rockport Logistics, our state-of-the-art warehouse in Aurora, IL. Check out our shipping packaging for a single aquarium. The inner box with supports ensures everything arrives safe and sound. Continental US orders ship UPS ground. New LED options arrived today and they are awesome! We’re putting together a short video and can’t wait to share it with you next week! Thanks again and enjoy the weekend! -Craig &amp; David Hey Kickstarters! Those were a couple pictures from our factory visit last week. We met the man who pulls the lever and watched a sample part get made! The part didn’t fit quite right but won’t delay things because it’s thermoformed so mold modifications are quick. We should have a new, hopefully perfectly fitting part next week. The great news is that we received samples of our injection molded part - which has tooling (molding) times of 6-8 weeks – and it fits great! Glass and other components are coming along nicely. We’re still on track for April shipping! We are visiting our warehouse/assembly/fulfillment center next week and will post another update then. If you haven’t done so already please complete your backer reward surveys ASAP because it will make a terrible mess of things if we start working on a partially completed reward spreadsheet – and you know how much we hate messes! We also expect to have a major announcement within the next couple of weeks about some amazing new LED options coming your way! This is exciting news! Stay tuned and thanks again for your support! -Craig and David A bunch of you added LEDs to your rewards since our last update so we figured we’d send out another reminder in case anybody missed it. This is your last chance to upgrade your aquarium with LEDs and add international shipping funds. Our project ends shortly after midnight tonight (CST) so the time to act is now! For those of you who missed it, we really recommend upgrading to the Large Bright-White LED to make the most of your aquarium. It’s so powerful that it has a stunning effect even in a lit room! The colored LED 4-pack is great for setting cool moods and parties and are for night-time use. We also had a bunch of questions about how to modify pledges. We will post instructions in the comment section below. Let us know if you have any questions by messaging us. This way we can see you pledge amount and are better able to assist you. Please help us in our push to $50,000! We’re almost there and your Facebook post or Tweet could be the one to push us over the top! Thanks again for all your support! We're excited to start production and will send updates along the way! Hey Kickstarters! We wanted to remind everybody that there are only 2 days left in our project so if you’re thinking about adding lights or aquariums to your order the time to act is now! The Large Bright-White LED is awesome and makes a dramatic impact at night (This is a must have accessory!) The colored LED 4-pack provides tantalizing accent lighting for setting cool moods and parties. The traditional Bright-White LED gets the most use in our home’s but you can’t go wrong with either (or both!) lighting options. This has been an extremely exciting and educational time for us and we can’t thank you enough for making it all possible! We’re excited to start production and get these aquariums in your homes, offices and classrooms around the world! We’ve had requests from Kickstarters who want the lid but aren’t ordering a light kit (lids are included in light kits). To add a lid to your aquarium reward please add $3 to your pledge per lid. The lid is made from clear plastic and fits inside the top of the aquarium. This recessed design makes it virtually invisible. There are holes in the lid for both aeration and easy feeding. The lid provides protection for your fish and can even be used as a shelf for holding food or other small supplies. Dimensions are approximately 2.75” x 1.5” deep. Check out pictures of the lid in action holding lights on our home page. Thanks again for your support! Here are the USPS Priority International rates to Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines and Japan.

This update is to address some concerns regarding international shipping. In addition to UPS International shipping we are now ALSO looking into USPS. USPS should be more cost effective however the delivery time is longer- but at least the shipping method will now be your decision. We will let you know at our soonest. These past couple weeks have been extremely educational for us and thanks again for all the helpful feedback. There is more to come and we will surely keep you posted! Hey Kickstarters, Below are the amounts to add to your pledge for international shipping to Canada, Europe, Scandinavia, Australia &amp; New Zealand. These are transportation costs only (tracking and insurance included). The importer (you) are responsible for payment of duties / taxes upon delivery. All international rewards ship UPS Expedited except for Canadian rewards which ship UPS Standard. UPS Expedited service includes all related transport fees. With UPS Standard service to Canada there’s an ”entry fee” of approximately $15 per package assessed for customs clearance. This fee will be collected at the time of delivery along with any other taxes / duties imposed by your government. Obviously, the more aquariums you order the lower your per aquarium cost will be, so reach out to your friends and split a 4-pack for the best pricing. We are still exploring shipping arrangements for other regions of the world and will be back with another update soon. There are no additional shipping charges for LED lights added your reward.

Contest ends Friday, January 27th @ 11:59pm CST Hey Kickstarters, Because of your overwhelming support one of our suppliers has begun work on the molds for the components of the aquarium. We hope to have everything in place to start production soon after the project ends. Thanks for getting us off to a fast start and making this possible! International shipping information is coming very soon. @Alnisa- just sent you an email to resolve the delivery issue. Thanks again for your support and enjoy! @EvgBel- Just sent you an email with shipping info. UPS needs your apartment # @Kester- Just sent you an email with shipping info. @Rich- Your glass replacement went out on Monday with tracking this time. Thanks! @Johnathan (Asked us about making larger aquariums) Yes, in 2013 we plan to launch at least 2 larger shapes and sizes and will continue to grow our line of aquariums. On top of the self-cleaning aspect we will be adding another very exciting element that we can't wait to share. A great way to keep in touch with us is by subscribing to our website here: <url>’t promote algae growth, water resistant and have the longest battery life of up to 8 hours on a single charge; not to mention they come with an optional remote. IMPORTANT: Per our instructions, push the button on the actual light unit OFF (not just the remote) when not in use to prolong battery life. We still encourage everyone to switch over to RECHARGABLE BATTERIES after the 3 AAA we provide burn out. We don’t expect you to keep buying new batteries every time- it just does not make sense. The greatest thing about not having any cords for a beautiful aquarium this size is the MOBILITY FACTOR. You can have three or more, different favorite places for your aquarium and none of them require an electrical socket. It makes a great center piece for your dinner table, illuminate your backyard patio on a warm summer night while hanging out with friends, travel with it in your RV around the world, relax in the tub and set the mood in your bedroom- the options are endless The great news for you DIY people is that these lights are extremely easy to convert into a plug in wall unit so you can have endless hours of illumination to enjoy. @Art T. As long as you provide regular water changes there is nothing to worry about regarding the “dead” space under the reservoir. We have not cleaned that area on some our aquariums for over a year and our water test results still continuously test positive and our Betta’s continue to be healthy and active. Remember, that space also provides growth for lots of beneficial bacteria that fish need in a healthy aquatic environment. By the way- keep and sterilize your next tooth brush instead of throwing it out- It will work great for removing the water line at the top of your aquarium (that probably have not yet formed). You can message us by clicking on our names under the project title. Wanted to let everyone know that we can’t look up contact or reward details through the comments section so please email us directly for questions and support. @Joe: Please contact us so we know where to send the missing components. We apologize for the inconvenience. @Kimberly: The remote would have been an additional cost. The LED lights also work independently from the remotes. If you look at the side with the bulbs you will also see a rubber button that looks similar to the bulbs- that's the on/off switch. Feel free to email/message us if you need anything else. @AdamDork- Yes, because this aquarium has no filtration and since Betta breath with their labyrinth organ and not under water with their gills, this is the only fish that will work for this aquarium. Stay tuned for our next kickstarter project! <url>"tub". We meant to type "tube" @ Leo K. yes the tub is designed to sit approx 1/2" above the reservoir floor and slightly below the grill. This setup provides the best suction power and cleaning performance. Thanks Carleton for your review- we are very happy you are happy! All other requests can be sent to <email> with your shipping address for extra parts if needed. Thanks! We will be posting another update tonight- Stay tuned. As far as heaters go we've found the Marina C10 works great. It has a built in thermostat and is preset. Remember to test your heater in the aquarium with a thermometer for a day or so before you add your Betta to make sure it's functioning pro Hey everyone, regardless of what other websites are saying no aquariums have left our warehouse and your aquariums will be the fist to ship. We are still on schedule to begin shipping on 10/12/12 and we will post an official update Friday night. We can't wait! Hey everyone- we will have a more exciting update in a little bit. Here's where we are now: The die for the reservoir is being manufactured. If need be they say adjustments are quick and easy however we don't anticipate any changes being required. Again, at this point everything is waiting on the die. The huge plastic sheets have been formed with each sheet containing 16 reservoirs. The die acts like a cookie cutter to "punch" out the reservoirs precisely and consistently. We will post our next update with ETA once we receive the sample cut part. Hey guys, just to let you know we did not get hit by a bus! We’ve been extremely busy handling everything that’s been going on here. We will have a thorough update by the end of the weekend. Thanks! Hey everyone, progress is being made and we'll have our next update posted next week. Thanks! Hey everyone, we are having another meeting with our factory next week and will post an update then. In the meantime have a great weekend! Hey backers, we are receiving the latest round of sample parts from the factory this week. We will know more and post another update by the end of the week. Thank again for your patience and support! Hello, you may get some build up on the walls over time but algae shouldn't be a problem if you keep these things in mind. Algae need 3 things to live: oxygen, food and sunlight. Oxygen is limited in the aquarium because there’s no moving water. Betta breathe air from the surface with their labyrinth organ so this is safe for the fish, too. Most other fish (including algae eaters) require oxygenated water, which is achieved by the use of filters and bubblers, thus elevating the incidence of algae growth. Algae don’t have the most appetizing diet. It feeds on the by-products of a dirty aquarium: fish waste and dirty water. By running the cleaning system regularly you greatly reduce the amount of nutrients essential for algae growth. Don’t put your aquarium in direct sunlight because this will almost guarantee algae growth. I have the prototypes in a room that gets good indirect sun light and algae growth is not a problem. If you do get a little algae simply wipe it off with a brush. Run the cleaning system afterward thoroughly to flush it out. In just a few minutes of maintenance your aquarium will look like new! Neither LEDs cause algae growth. They also will not promote plant growth. So if you plan on using live plants make sure your aquarium gets at least some indirect sunlight. We will publish an update with a list of low-light plants we’ve used that thrive in the aquarium and can easily be found at a big box pet store near you. If a houseplant will grow in the room so will these plants – and there’s a pretty good variety of them, too. @Rachel- Thanks so much! Yes, we will be using the same copper spout as seen in our photos and videos for our initial production run. In the future we plan on providing additional, unique spout options. We will be sure to keep you all posted. Thanks again! Amit, your set to go with the Large Bright White LED. Thanks! Hi Tiffany, thanks for your support! Yes, you will only be billed once for the new amount at the end of the project. International shipping info is posted in the updates tab (link below).

Hi soonweijie, we are still in the process of determining international shipping. We'll let everybody know in plenty of time. Thanks for your patience. Hi Christine, The light hood (lid) doesn’t need to be removed because it allows air in the aquarium and doesn't interfere with Bettas access to the surface. The hood is recessed inside the top of the aquarium. It fits securely and can be taken off easily with one hand but would be difficult to remove with a paw. It’s a sturdy part. We haven’t tested it but feel it will provide good protection from curious pets. Hey Brandon, Lot’s of aquarium manufacturer’s make half-gallon Betta tanks. We agree that most provide a lousy home. That’s why we built a better one! You see, the #1 problem with half-gallon tanks is that the small water volume pollutes quickly and becomes unsafe for fish. This happens because most people don’t clean their aquariums enough. Our system makes the cleaning quick and painless. A clean half-gallon is a much better home than an aquarium 10 times its size that’s not properly maintained. Like most things in life, it’s the water quality, not quantity that’s most important. It's true that Betta don’t swim around a lot and don’t need much space to be happy. They like to float and hover in the water. Unfortunately, some manufacturers take advantage of this fact by producing cheap, tacky little boxes with no regard for the movements of the fish. As you see in our video and pics, this aquarium provides plenty of room for your Betta fish to swim and play We’ve had our fish for well over a year in a variety of half-gallon prototypes. They are awesome, beautiful, happy and healthy fish! Bottom line: Run the self-cleaning system regularly, provide good food and some love and your fish will thrive in this aquarium just like ours are thriving! Hi Anthony and Jerry, We've made self-cleaning systems for all different sizes of aquariums - up to 55 gallons. We hope to offer all kinds of setups in the near future (maybe even custom). The larger this project grows and the more attention we attract, the more we can do. So please share this project with everyone you know. We really appreciate your support! Hi soonweije, Blue gourami's need far more space. We only recommend Betta be housed in this aquarium. However, we are working on modifications for frogs & toads and will let you know when it comes to be! Hi Rick, One of the cool things about this product is that you can choose how much water to remove/replace during a cleaning. For a quick flush pour in a 16 oz glass. For a more thorough water change you can pour in a pitcher. Of course, you'll want to match the size of the collection container with the amount of water being poured in (or put it in the sink for very large water changes), and you don’t want to pour the water in so fast that you overflow the tank. We designed the aquarium so you don’t have to add any water after the cleaning cycle stops. But there is room to add a half-inch or so of water before you activate the system. And don’t worry about your Betta jumping out when the water level in your aquarium is high during cleaning. The water flowing in keeps your fish safe toward the bottom of the aquarium. The water volume in the patent-pending reservoir is very small. The reservoir is the trap for the waste. International Kickstarters: We are still working out shipping and will let you know before we fund about the cost. Thank you for your patience. @Alasdair: We are considering offering a clear spout as an option; but this would considerably raise molding costs. However, if this project does really well, we may be able to offer it as an option. In the meantime we hope you enjoy the classic look and feel of the copper spout. "Will the rocks hinder the dirty stuff from getting to the bottom reservoir?" Nancy C. The natural rocks are smooth and rounded so debris simply slides between the large gaps between rocks and falls into plumbing system. The glass gems work great too but they are a bit smaller so an occasional bit of waste may get caught between the rocks. No worries though. When you run the self-cleaning system the water flow usually sucks it out of the glass gems to be flushed out of the tank. If it doesn't get sucked down simply poke the gems with a stick next time the system is running to free the debris. It’s important that the self-cleaning system is running before you agitate the gems to make sure the debris is sucked down and isn’t stirred up, if you get what I mean. Don’t know why we didn’t post this earlier but the dimensions of the aquarium are 4.25" x 4.25 x 11.5" high. The aquarium body is made from sturdy 3/16” glass. The aquarium holds just over a half gallon and weighs about 4.5 pounds empty and 9.5 pounds full. Happy New Year Kickstarters! Thank you for all your support! We’ve received questions about different types of fish in the aquarium. For now we recommend that only Betta fish be housed in the aquarium. They don’t require much space and don’t need aeration, filtration or heaters. We are working on a really cool modification for Frogs and Toads and will let you know as soon as it’s ready. We don't recommend goldfish in this aquarium. We are currently testing it out with tadpoles and mini frogs and will be back with our results. Hello Kickstarters! Thanks for all your support! This is the most exciting thing we've ever done and we appreciate you being a part of it! You are awesome! Craig Hi soxcited - The lights are for your viewing pleasure. There is no need to leave on for the benefit of the fish. Hi Yong-Soo Chung- Regarding your question about the light. It actually fits perfectly inside, at the top of the tank. We designed it so you can't see it sticking out at the top. Thanks for your support! -David Turover I've just got notice that you guys are doing retail sales, but I've never received the NoClean Aquariums that were part of my sponsorship level. Have you guys shipped yet? Hi! I have not yet received the aquarium. Please, check shipping status. I have not yet received the aquarium and am wondering whether it was sent to my old home address. Is it possible for you to check on the status? @Rich- From the looks of the comments they may have a lot of issues to sort out with different people's orders- Mine was busted as well, and I'm waiting on a new set. I think we just have to be patient with them. So November first I got my broken aquarium, was told a new one was being shipped.. 2 weeks later, still nothing. Was told they would check with the wharehouse for s shipping number.. guess what still no reply... NOT HAPPY ! ! ! You know, I feel I've been remarkably patient with you guys throughout this entire process because I really supported how thorough you were being, but there's a giant thing you all missed - the light. Are you kidding me with this? This is not an acceptable method of lighting the tank. I can not afford to keep buying AAA batteries! Did you not test them AT ALL in ALL THAT TIME you spent working out the kinks of this project? They are USELESS. I got my tank a couple days ago, and due to Hurricane Sandy, had no power to post. Just got power back today and I must say I love my tank! The tank had a tiny crack at the top, but I don't mind it, as well as one of the LED lights(green) was on on arrival, seems it was on during whole trip. I don't mind that either. I just want to say great work guys! Got my tank couple of days back...set it up as per the instructions, put in a very nice red betta, a fern and so far everything is going well...I only wish the white LED lights last longer...mine started dimming after about one and half days. How long are the batteries suppose to last anyway? two tanks arrived safe and sound this morning, Melbourne Australia got my tanks and all is well, just a question. There is a "dead" area that holds water in the corners below the reservoir. based on other fish keeping experience this usually gives rise to anaerobic bacteria which can be a problem. I do not see that these areas are flushed as water is added. I am not saying it is a problem for Beta, as I have not kept many of them. I would like to ask what your experience has been and if this leads to brown areas in the corners or other contamination and negative effects to the fish. Got my tank yesterday. Everything works great. Now I need to get the fish. Great product. When will you be selling to the public? i cant get the hang of actually flushing the waste out of the bottom. any tricks for this? So I just received my tank! Been having a tinker with it and was just wondering -- when are you guys likely to start working on a larger version of the tank? :) Thanks for responding to my post, Craig & David. I received my tanks today and I opened one of them up to try and put together. However, when I did an inventory of the parts, it seems I'm missing the reservoir piece part D in the instructions...I opened up all my other aquariums and it seems that none of them have the part D...is this a mis-print or was I 'lucky' enough to have the same part missing from all of my aquariums? I received my tanks, but I was disappointed to see that I was not sent a remote for my led light. It won't turn on any other way. I got one of the tanks set up without too much trouble. Although, I did dent the lip of the reservoir bottom a bit while installing it. I hope that doesn't affect it's function. Got my tank up and going...but are Bettas the only type of fish for this? Well I got my tank today. Everything was well packaged and included instructions. I have my dragon scale Betta living it up in his new home. Thanks guys for a great product! Received my aquariums. No instructions provided. Wasn't able to find instructions on their site either. I was just curious as to how far off the reservoir floor everyone's acrylic tubing is. Mine is about half an inch (approximately 12 mm) away from the bottom, just a tad below the grill (approximately 2 mm). Just curious... I'm in Southern California, and I received my NoClean Aquarium today. If you haven't received yours yet, I hope you will be fortunate enough to receive it soon enough... I just received mine. Im not sure about getting new packaging before shipping it out.. Looks like all that was done was 2 extra pieces of cardboard folded in half to keep the package from moving around but I still felt it moving around when I picked up the box. Also I did not get any directions. Seems rushed out to me. The package came a few days before the tracking number did for me. But as I opened the box, the packaging itself impressed me. Very effective for how simple it was. Great job guys! I hoping to get fish for the tanks very soon. I would only caution folks that trying to get the reservoir in correctly can be tricky for some. It's tough to get it positioned correctly when you can't risk putting your hand into the tank (because you're sure you won't be able to get it back out!) and have to use tools. I like how my package came in before the tracking number did. :) Has anyone in Canada received their aquariums yet? Mine just arrived today. Well packaged with no shipment damage. Easy set up. Great product. Terrific job guys, it was worth the extra time you took to get everything right. Congrats! CHECK YOUR TANKS!!! So excited to get mine but after all this waiting and the new packaging boxes, my tank is cracked?! I just recieved my NoClean in the mail today. I live in San Diego, CA, in case anyone wants to compare shiping times. I put the whole thing together in about 5 minutes and it's working exactly like it should. Even better, the white LED top looks great and is very bright. Definitely a well constructed product and the instructions were simple and easy to follow. One note I can make about packing is that the acrylic tube used to bring the water up from the bottom had been cracked in transit. The crack doesn't seem to affect the functionality of the device in any way ( I've replenished the water many times in testing so far) but if mine was partially broken, it seems possible that others' may be completely broken. How will we get replacement parts in that event? Thanks for a great product! Can we, whom haven't received their tanks yet, get a shipping update please? Some people already got theirs a week ago...what about the others? Any shipping news? Someone asked about heaters, And I believe there will be a lot of additional questions. here is a resource <url>"bob" died while waiting for his new home. I am headed out to buy a plant and a new fish. Great job guys! Thanks Craig & David!! I got my tanks and they arrived in perfect condition. The instructions were really well detailed and made it easy to construct. I can't wait to get some movement going in my tanks! Just got my NoClean Aquarium today and I love it! You guys came through and it was well worth the wait! I will be buying a second tank very soon and I'm recommending this to all my friends! Thanks to your hard work guys! Would be awesome to have a list of fish that could live well in this aquarium. I like betta, but I've had several of them in the past... There are a few species that would do well... Of course Beta, but there are other Labyrinth Fish. Gouramis can be colorful and can live with more than one to a tank, I would suggest the dwarfs as some of the others get very big. also paradise fish if you can find them. If you have small bioload, and a good planting of real plants, you might be able to do 2-3 small tetras like cardinals. nothing too big. Thank you. Now it is clear. that is why these are betta tanks, Betta have a labrynth instead of gills, they get their oxygen from the air, not the water. Hi guys, I have 1 question. Which tools I can use to generate oxygen in Aquarium. Otherwise fish live 2-3 weeks. Hope they ship soon here. They are in 'stock' elsewhere : <url>"least documented" I have over 200 of these suckers under my belt and this is not the worst one at all. Craig or David.... Please this is strange -- a project like yours -- there should be some simple answers. @Craig & David When do you expect to get the sample cut part? This is without a doubt the worst documented project on kickstarter. I seriously doubt this project will ever come to fruition. Craig & David, What is the word? How is it going? What are the current hold ups ? Are things being placed in boxes or did something else need to be adjusted --- remolded ? Let us know please. Wondering and wondering ---- just fill us in -- it's not like we are going to go away -- so take us on your ride please. @Steve yeah. I posted that and then saw the update and you can't go back and delete it. But thank you for pointing it out. Any updates? It's been several weeks since the last update where you were waiting for the reservoir cutting to be done to specifications? As you may know, nobody is accountable for ETA delays on kickstarter projects. Basically they could deliver a "perfect" product in 2015 and you will have to suck it up. How about a new status update ? Is it too soon -- seems with all the delays you would be tracking and would be able to give us a closer idea for ship date at this point. @Marc You do know that they did in fact provide an update that weekend right? Check the updates section of the Kickstarter. i backed this project since my fish died. true story. My fish has died since I backed this project. True story now 4 months late Craig and David, Have you noticed that today is August 8, 2012. The weekend has long passed and you have yet to give an update. I really want your product. Please let us know what is going on! OK Calling you out Craig & David --- waited a week for the "Promised Update" so where is it? I'm starting to wonder if you guys got hit by a bus or something..... Just stopped by to check after I cleaned my fish tank...again. I'm with you, Brian. What's up, Craig & Dave? No updates in almost a month - what's going on fellows? How's the project chugging along? @ Elisabeth -- its wonderful you are happy -- however given the forum I think many of us expected more updates and information --- sure it's not a order system -- but updates that just say we had a problem and we are working it out does not cut it really --- we placed a bet but really we were paying for the behind the scenes view -- we have not gotten it. I have seen very little real updates except for delays because X part was not correct or what not...how about posting pictures/videos explain the problems show your solutions -- give us something except delays and it's comming -- I might not be speaking for everyone but I wanted the behind the scene view -- and I have not received that. I'm glad to hear you're making progress and I look forward to your update next week! I'm sure you guys are working super hard to align all the pieces to the production puzzle. I think people should be a little more patient given the forum, but hey, you can’t please everyone, right? Time for an update guys.... Any updates? Is it still on target for shipping before the end of July? I agree with Steve. This is Kickstarter, not Amazon.com. Craig and David have been very conscientious about updating us at all stages in the process, and I'm happy they want to ensure we get a quality product. As much as I want my tank now, I've lived my whole life without a self cleaning aquarium and feel confident that I can wait a little bit longer :) Can't wait to see what they come up with next! Do you guys really think if these guys were *scam artists* they would use their real names and hurt their reputations? lol This was their first forray into production and it's only two guys. I'm pretty sure this isn't their sole means of income and they are just really busy working on getting the tank made and living their life. I guess you'll be proved wrong when you receive your tank on your doorstep. Have a little faith. Something is fishy about lack of updates and no shipping...starting to feel scammy. This user's account has been deleted. @Matthew Cutler I'm not saying there aren't scammers but this one doesn't seem like it. Just seems like they had an idea but might've not fully researched the process of creating the product in a grander scale. But I am tired of hearing "we have one more part to get sized" on EVERY SINGLE update. The last update was some time ago and delivery was expected in April? Is it safe to assume we've all been ripped off? Any updates? I have been involved in several Kickstarters, if it is a simple design, you get quick results, if it has complex parts, it takes longer. Basically Kickstarter, in the product end, is a place where relative newbies cut their teeth on the outsourced production issue. It takes massive companies just as long, but they do not have the same communications channel or visibility. think of this as your own window into the contract manufacture world. Can you even get refunds? Just saying, I have yet to have a single Kickstarter deliver their goods within 3+ months of completion time. Heck, I've yet to receive a single Kickstarter! I agree, I'd rather them take the time to get this working correctly, though, I wonder if this could've been accomplished prior? Four months now, with another "couple weeks," so I assume maybe these can be Christmas presents before all is said and done? I'd rather have the product work right and be great than not, I mean, if you don't want to wait, just request a refund. Well there's an update...but now there is another thing we have to wait on? How about an update with where things are at now? Was the simple mold modification truly simple? How about some pictures or videos to backup your updates -- We paid the money for the ride and the adventure of your startup. Not complaining we don't have the product but rather we aren't really getting an inside view either -- just excuses and postponing. Instead how about give us some pictures -- give us some true updates. Hey guys, I know that your doing your best... with all the set backs and the problems that arises, just keep on plugging along. Your going about it the right way and I really appreciate your best effort. Keep up the good work and keep all of us updated. GREAT JOB @Pallen Chiu: Remember you did not buy a product. You gave money to an up and coming business, with the promise they would send you some product for free once they get up and running. If you expecting these guys to drop everything to rush and get you your product you should go buy things on Amazon. KickStarter is about helping the new guy out, funding innovative idea's and letting the "little guy" have his day in the sun to show off that inventors and idaliests at home can also make a difference. Craig and David, keep doing what your doing. You're doing it right, and I expect nothing but the best from someone who is willing to put this much passion and commitment into making a product right. Many people these days try and get something kicked out quick and easy to make a buck, and we can all see you guys are doing more than the average joe. Good Job! tl;dr stop your whining, go to amazon if you want a product to ship to you next day. Pallen, you'll find yourself in the minority of pretty much every Kickstarter project but the ones that dragged on for more than a year and/or turned out to be scammy. People are here for quality goods, not arbitrary deadlines that get 'stuck to'. Reasonableness is always a factor, but I'd much rather them set an internal date, miss it by a month, and get me a better product than come out and promise a date and have to rush something at the last minute. I hope everyone gets lights for the tank as a upgraded free thing for waiting! LoL! Nah, but keep up the good work. Keep us updated, I want my fish to enjoy the tank! I'm satisfied with waiting as long as I get a quality product in the end. At the end of the day, it's the fish who have to live in the tank. I know if I was the fish i'd like it to be as safe and long lasting as possible free of leaks and other issues. This website is designed to "Kick Start" ideas and experiencing production issues is all part of initial growth. It sounds like you guys have ironed out the kinks and all of us customers will thank you for it in the end. Correction in my earlier comment - I meant, "I have lost a lot of faith as a potential user". Craig and David, I appreciate that you are sharing updates with us consistently but I have a lot of faith as a potential user and supporter of this project. I appreciate your openness of communication but that does not matter to me as much as making a firm commitment and sticking to it. Instead of providing an open-ended update with a "hang in there" message, please be professional and honor your customer by thinking through what a realistic postponement is given your quality standards, explicitly put it in writing, and hold yourself accountable. Though I agree with Melissa, it's important to keep backers updated. Without some plan, backers will be left to chargeback their transactions with the credit card companies. I'm as excited as everyone else to receive the finished product, but PLEASE DON'T RUSH. I would rather wait another couple months and receive a quality product than receive it today and discover something doesn't work properly. Keep doing what you're doing to make sure the aquarium is up to our standards! :) When should we expect something to be completed and shipped? Any updates? Jesus I completely forgot I backed this. It was suppose to ship 3 months ago, what gives? Update please!!!!! Update please!!!!! Is it just me or does it seem like this project is way behind -- it seemed as if they were ready to ship a while ago -- now, here you are just getting samples. Are we getting mixed signals ? What's the ETA for shipping a final product? If your only receiving "sample" parts from the factory then does that mean delivery of the Fish Tanks will be further delayed? Thanks for the update. Hope it all goes well. Good luck, guys. What's going on guys? Um, please update with current status please? My little fish are starting to hate me -- and I'm worried the animal fish protection services are going to be knocking at my door soon..... Please update us on where the new home for our gilled companions is located and when we might be able to have them. Update please!!!!! any new updates on the shipping dates? I'm very excited to get mine. Do you have a shipping schedule yet? Thanks. Is it shipping soon, my sisters b-day is mid April Shipping schedule? I have found, in other fishkeeping experience, that plants use the same nutrients as algae, and can assist in keeping the tank algae free. in a tank of this size, with even a small (5) school of cardinals, a few plants would provide enough oxygen without a bubbler or filter. I would also suggest doing more frequent water changes, with declorinated water, to insure your buffer stays active. the buffer is a collection of bacteria and micro-organisms that provide breakdown of fish waste and prevent algae blooms. Quick question - do we have to clean the sides of the aquarium? Seems like the water filters out the water, but does the gunk get on the sides? I'm so excited. April can't get here soon enough! @Craig and David, Hey guys, I might have missed it, but I wasn't able to find where to purchase the $15 LED light when I bought the tank... Is there something I'm missing or should I just be patient? Thanks a bunch, super excited as i've always wanted a beta fish and now my lazyness doesn't get in the way How do you join the shipping notification list? I'm a buyer from the UK and want to know how much I need to send to cover shipping. Thanks. Not only am I be a backer and soon to be a frequent buyer but I would like to be a mermaid for the future life size tank :-) congrats friends. I'll promote and support you. Congrats on a fabulous looking product and a successful Kickstarter! Will the cleaning spouts be that beautiful copper on the larger production run? Congratz! This is the start to your new business... Well done and have a great new endeavour. You guys have done a fantastic job and are ending it with a BANG - 2 of your best days ever!! Looking forward to receiving and using my aquariums. Hey everyone, keep a lookout - I think these guys may have more neat new products up their sleeves sometime in the future. $50,000+! congrats, craig and david! I just added $15 to my pledge. Is that good for adding the white LED lights? OMG! soo close to finishing!!! I can't wait!!! WAITING FOR IT TOO END ...................So I can get my fishtank of course BooYAh Guys, no need to answer, I just saw the "manage your pledge" button. Guys, I pledged a total of $80 for one aquarium and bright-white LED. Now that I know that shipping to Singapore is $60, how do I pay this amount? If I want to order another aquarium and white LED, how do I change my original pledge to the new one? Thanks David and Craig, I was so excited to find this! I submitted a pledge and adjusted it later to add the LED lights. When I did this, I had to process another Amazon transaction, I received a receipt for the original amount and the new amount. I will only be billed the new adjusted pledge amount, correct? So if let's say I want buy 4 aquariums 3 colored LEDs and 1 Bright white LEDs and I living in Singapore..what will be the total cost amoubt i have to pledge including shipping fees ? David and Craig, I've gotten nothing but VERY POSITIVE feedback from contacts who were able to pledge or not! Everyone loves the concept of NO CLEAN AQUARIUMS! With 10 days to go, I'm really hoping BACKERS ARE SHARING YOUR PROJECT WITH MORE AND MORE PEOPLE who'd appreciate the response you've gotten so far, and would like to contribute to your future success! BE A BETTA BACKER! I need to know the shipping fee to Japan pretty soon. guys, with 11 days to go can you let me know what's shipping like to singapore? Hi Craig & David, Can you tell me the shipping cost to Singapore. Hi Dave and Craig, I'm looking forward to getting the two new NoClean Aquariums I ordered (or pledged?) for my office reception area. Before shipping, I will want to add lights, though I'm not sure which way to go between bright or colored. Rocks or glass? Good luck with this project! Will you send us a message asking which LED package we would like or do you add it yourself when you "pledge" ? :] Looking forward to seeing the USPS shipping option, because I'm sorry, but there's no way I'm paying twice the price of the product just for shipping. transportation cost damn expensive :( Great idea, but the name almost sounds like a campaign for dirty aquariums! Great idea, I have a suspicion your project will surge when you have sorted out the int'l shipping! Now to decide which type of Betta fish I want.... By the way, does anybody else see Purple, not Pink for the last LED light? Am I color-blind? Would it help to have an algae eating critter to do some extra duty or not at all - as they won't find anything to eat? I've been meaning to get a new bowl for my beta, but this is even better! Can't wait! ic..hope international shipping can be determined and processed within 49 days..plan to pledge 210 for four aquariums :) any updates on international shipping :) Fantastic idea! I sent y'all a message about my thoughts, but thought I'd post it here too in case others want to weight in on this. I breed bettas, most of mine are large halfmoons imported from Thailand. I know there are many halfmoons available in the US as well. I really hope a more horizontal version of this tank could be made....I know it would probably mess with the physics of it all, BUT....I know my males (and females especially) like to swim back and forth rather than up and down. Some folks even think that more vertical tanks can lead to males becoming tail biters, but I really don't know for sure about this! Can't wait to see your future projects, and hope y'all can make a gallon tank that would allow a possible small heater to be put in for those who are in colder areas too! Very exciting indeed, this entire idea! YAY! Great work!!!! Love the "much BETTA and more eFFICient" part of the video and how Craig laughs after David says that. I was wondering how tightly the light lid fit onto the tank, because a) since bettas are surface breathers woud it be ok to leave that on all the time? and b) I have two cats and I'm sure they will attempt to go fishing while I'm away at work, so depending on how the lid fits I might place it in a more inaccessible area of the house. :) Frogs would be really interesting! I have done some research and have found out that the minimum amount of water should be a 1 gallon at the least. Are these tanks safe for the fish to thrive in not just survive in? is blue gourami fishes suitable for this aquarium?..it is one of the labyrinth species Hi, how much water is contained in each of the two reseviors (sp?) How much water is removed during the cleaning cycle? How much water do you have to put in once the cleaning cycle is complete? Thanks Yes! I too am interested in a larger setup. I am not sure about the physics, but if everything was scaled proportionately larger in terms of dimensions, wouldn't the larger setup work just like the smaller setup? In terms of efficient cleaning, fish waste management and the eco-system, I suppose there must be a limit as to how much larger a setup can be.... I would be very interested in this setup on a larger scale - say 2-3 feet tall! Betta fish don't get their oxygen from the water like gill-breathers. They get their air by swimming to the top and gulping the air from the surface. So happy to see how many people recognize what a great idea this is! Love the idea of your perpetually clean aquarium on one's desk where that happy Betta fish will brighten the work day for everyone that see it! Cynthia Steven and Andrew, fair comments, just depends what you like, maybe the clear pipe could be an option? Hey I hope this can be make available to other countries as well..don mine paying for delivery charges..living in Singapore and very interested to get this aquarium :) i agree with steven. the brass is a nice touch. I think it gives it more of that "Proudly Made in the USA" look. This tank looks like it'd last for generations! @Alasdair Dunlop- I think it's a matter of preference for the exit pipe on the outside. To me that gives the tank a more inventive steampunk feel and I actually like it a lot. Love the product and have just become a backer but I am in the UK, can you let us Brit's know about international shipping please? Also, the one thing I have to say is the brass pipe on the rear isn't the most pleasing thing to look at...is there a way you can make it clear like the internal pipe? Best of luck with the project. I didn't see the dimensions of the aquarium, can you please list it? will the rocks hinder the dirty stuff from getting to the bottom reservoir? do you think small platys will be ok inside? thanks! Would it be acceptable to just have a little goldfish in the Aquarium, or is it too small? I am a buyer from HK, I am wondering is it OK to ship product to HK?? Does anyone use a heater for their bettas? I imagine this would go well in Petco or someplace similar. Part of me wonders how big this will be after Kickstarter. Yeah it definitely will. I was one of the first backers and I knew it would take off, right when I saw the video. Wow! Met and exceeded that goal pretty quickly. This one looks like it is going to take off! I can't wait to get my NoClean Aquariums! Yeah I was thinking goldfish... Bettas do well in a small amount of water that sits still for the day. The tank doesn't look that big, so something like ornamental goldfish would be limiting. I imagine a small feeder type goldfish would do ok if the tank is a gallon or so. Bettas are easy to keep in a simple tank. Is there a reason why this tank is only for Bettas? Just curious... Do bettas like lights? Do you leave the light on all the time or turn it on only when viewing/feeding? Sad that the colored lights use button cells rather than AAA batteries. I went for one of each so I can try both and see what works better. I just saw that they use AAA batteries, thanks. How do the large bright LED lights work? Are they battery operated or plugged in? Also, how does it attach on top of the aquarium? Thanks! Since I've never enjoyed the task of cleaning an aquarium, I've been waiting for a self cleaning operation for some time. Can't wait to receive and use these in my home and in my office.
