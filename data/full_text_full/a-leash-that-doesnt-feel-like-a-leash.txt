Now go out and enjoy your walks, together! – Jennifer + Shannon The We Leash Don’t you love the idea of going for a walk with your dog? You and your best friend strolling down the sidewalk, sharing the morning sun. It’s a wonderful concept – but it doesn’t often work that way, does it? What should be fun can easily dissolve into a drag…literally! Ugh! Not to mention those times your dog goes full Cujo at passers-by. You know, the kind of display that makes you want to insist to the world that he belongs to the neighbors. As a strong believer in the value of the human – dog bond, I felt certain we could do better. After all, walks are meant to strengthen your body – and your relationship – rather than putting a strain on them. Walks should be interactive. And they should be joyful. One day, I realized that the happiest I’d ever seen dogs on leash was when they were proudly holding a part of their leash or a favorite toy in their mouths. Their people looked happy, too. Best of all, they seemed engaged with one another. So with that in mind, I designed the We Leash – a handle for people and a handle for dogs. No more pulling or dragging. And because the design helps prevent dogs from feeling restrained, they feel more secure and are less likely to react inappropriately on leash. Easy for those dogs that like to carry stuff, right? But, what if your dog isn’t one to enjoy carrying things in his mouth? No problem! He can quickly learn the pleasure of being able to take his human for a nice stroll. Just by learning to hold his attached leash handle or toy, he can feel safe, secure, and connected to his favorite person. It's easy to teach and easy to learn! The We Leash allows your dog a feeling of secure attachment and a sense of control that will reap benefits far beyond your actual walks. Easy, well-behaved dogs are those who feel both secure in the love of their people and capable of exerting some measure of control in their own lives. You and your dog will love this leash…and the connection it brings to your time together. Enjoy your walk! Jennifer Our Most Asked Questions What do I do with the toy if my dog does not want to carry his handle or toy on our walk? You'll love this part. If at times your dog chooses not to hold the toy, the two lines simply snap together creating a “regular” leash. You can unclip the toy and we have provided a carabiner for convenience near the human handle where the toy or handle can hang. I noticed the dogs you feature were retriever breeds, how difficult will it be to use with non-retriever breeds? You are right about the retrievers on video but I've had great success with other breeds-as have friends and our test team. Basically if your dog will hold anything in his or her mouth at all (including a rawhide) it should be easy to encourage him/her to hold the leash. Any necessary effort is well worth the advantages-for both of you.

Praise for the We Leash "The We Leash is the best new idea I've seen in my 25 years as a dog training professional" Judy L., Professional Dog Trainer "There's never been a leash like the We Leash – providing two-way interaction, dogs feel less restrained, and less restraint means less problem behaviors." Kent B., DVM "My dog loves the We Leash. Walking with the We Leash is fun for us both. When can I buy a second one?" Mike E., We Leash Test Team Can we help?

Include your address, choice of toy (Giraffe, Aardvark, Chicken, Navy/Orange, Orange/Red, or Red/Yellow Binkie). Also include if you increased your pledge, and if so what you would like for the additional funds (Leashes were $32 and Toys were $13). We all have our favorite toys here, and we were surprised to see how evenly the survey choices were divided between the six toys. I thought for sure you would all choose the Aardvark, Jennifer loves (is obsessed) with the Binkies, Gee the Giraffe, and Kent thought you'd choose the Chicken.

A generous portion of our proceeds directly benefits Canine Assistants in their mission to provide service dogs to people in need, free of charge. For your contribution, we thank you. This offer applies to all backers, current and new, so please forward this on! Jennifer + Shannon From This . . . To This . . . Today you turned a great idea into an amazing product, we are funded! Jennifer had been using this primitive version of the We Leash with so much success for what seemed like forever at Canine Assistants. Now, thanks to you, all dogs and the people that love them will be able to use a much a better version of the We Leash – an uber-comfortable neoprene handle and slight stretch for you and fun,organic plush toys for your dog. This is a great day for dogs (and their people too)! Leashes are on their way (well, nearly)! This morning, we had the pleasure of calling our factory to say that we actually can pay them and please, step on it! Leashes are on schedule, to be delivered mid-October this year, in plenty of time for the holidays! So, if you know anyone looking for a great holiday gift for themself, their dog, or a loved one and their dog, please share the We Leash with them. To share on Facebook, click here <url>– that's what we mostly have around Canine Assistants! But, I've had great success with other breeds-as have friends and our test team. Basically if your dog will hold anything in his or her mouth at all (including a rawhide) it should be easy to encourage him/her to hold the leash. Making your dog’s end of the leash ‘come alive’ by wiggling it or waving it is usually all it takes. When your dog grabs the leash, praise him! It won’t take long for your dog to realize the benefits of walking you on leash. Any necessary effort is well worth the advantages-for both of you. Thanks for the question! – Jennifer Without Further Ado – Cute Puppy Pictures Thank you to Kevin Lowery Photography, he shot all of our We Leash photos, and many of the puppy photos, what a talent!

We will send a survey at the end of the Kickstarter asking for your pick(s) for your pledge. Funny enough a fox is on our short list for our next round, we already have him sketched! Thanks for the question! Hi Sheila! At the end of the Kickstarter campaign you will receive a backer survey, where we will ask which toy (s) you would like, your address etc. Look for that the first week in October. Thank you so much for you support! Thanks Adair! Banks will love his new leash! I never recieved my order Wondering how these are being shipped and if a tracking numbers are available? I see some have arrived. I haven't got a tracking number yet, should I be worried? Backer #152. Got mine in the mail today (Canada). Love the purple colour btw. My puppy is trying to figure it out - should be a fun lewrning experience. The two of them instantly loved the giraffe toy. Can't wait to show off this cool KS project. Do you have a place we should post pics - like a hash tag or account? My leash came today. My dog loves it, but during our first walk, she bit the clip portion holding the toy on and it cracked apart already. It was a great leash for about 10 minutes. :-/ So excited!! I actually showed the Kickstarter page to Harley's trainer and the trainer and her team are excited and want to see the leash when we get it! Is everything on track for shipping this month? Really excited to use this with my dog! I never received the survey to choose which toy Hi there, when I backed the project I thought I'd be sending it to the US, but want to ship this internationally instead - how can I change this? Thanks! So excited for your project! Cooper will be modeling his leash! Tashi, my english lab black pup, is bouncing with excitement.� Would love to see a dragon or unicorn in the toy selection options. � I have 2 goldens and I can't wait to use this to keep working on their manners. At 14 mths and 3 mths they r a cute handful. What kinds of toy animals and colors are available so far, and would you be open to suggestions/requests from backers in the future? I'd love to have my Ringo carry a cute little fox with him on walks, for example! I just pledged and it didn't ask me for my address for shipping. Where do I provide my shipping address? Woohoo! So excited to see this come to life! Beautiful video. Can't wait to get one for Banks :)
