The topic was ”Creative Ways to ’Play’ with Smart Toys”. Moff was covered by USA today at the SXSW2014 in Austin, Texas! In addition to that, Moff and our demos were covered by many medias, TVs or radios. Thank you for their coverage! Moff team Hi everyone! I'm Aki.We exhibited our Moff at SXSW 2014. Moff has been selected as "The Coolest Tech Products We Discovered at SXSW 2014" !!!! It's a great honor for us! <url>"patter recognition". We registered the particular movement / position patterns when developed. Moff Band and the app will recognize your movements and positions, and will calculate whether they match the registered patterns. Concerning the toy guns, I think, the range of our registered patterns is too small... We will deal with it. Thank you for your comment! It is greatly helpful. @Abdul Halim Mat Ali thank you for your comment! And sorry for the inconvenience.Concerning our Android version, please kindly wait. We will do our best! @arckal thank you for your comment! Have you already got our Moff Band? We hope you will enjoy with Moff Band. By the way, thank you for your questions! 1) does app allows you to customize sound? i.e. can we add out our own voice on some action? As of now, unfortunately, not yet. However, in future, we want to do that. We think it will be helpful for kids' creativity. 2) how loud is action sound? It depends on the situation. For the ordinary living room, it will be appropriate sound. 3) can more then one band connected to single iOS device/app? As of now, maximum is 2 Moff Bands can connect to single iOS device. 2 people can enjoy with each band or 1 person can enjoy with 2 Moff Bands, such as drum play. Please see the below play! <url>）.iPhone4 is not equipped with BLE. And the version is only over i0S7.1. Can you get these iOS devies? Best reagards, Moff team @Mikael Nordgren @Abdul Halim Mat Ali Thank you for your comment! Your feedback will be very helpful for us. We are always thinking of Android and its importance.As of now, it's difficult to say the firm date. However, we recognize android support's importance. we wish we could do everything at the same time. We will do and introduce step by step. Sorry for your patience. Your kind understanding and feedback is highly appreciated. We will keep on updating info. Best regards, Moff team @Abdul Halim Mat Aki Thank you for your comment! Now, we are making molds. When molds made, we can show you more pictures! @Lilli and @Maxi Thank you for your comment! And sorry for our late update. Now, we are doing our final check for the preparation of mold and the other mass production. In a few days, we will get the sample for this. When we get this sample, we will updates. Best regards, Moff team @Nell Thank you for your funding and comment. Yes. I also have my kid.I believe the safety is the most important issue. We put high priorities on safety. We plan to do some safety tests. We will take care of safety more. Thank you. @Danny Thank you for your message!!! We hope your nephew will enjoy our Moff. @Masaru Thank you for your message!!! @Otoshi No Kami (Erudito No. 40723) Thank you for your comment and back! We will do our best for all our backers. Thank you! @kokobin Thank you for your comment! It was greatly helpful. As of now, we will concentrate on the delivery for our backers. @kokobin Sorry for your inconvenience...As our 1st step, we will do our best for producing good device and service. Your kind understanding will be highly appreciated. @Otoshi No Kami Thank you for your comment and kind understanding. @kokobin Thank you for your comment! Our slap band is ok for both adults and children. They can enjoy the same Moff band. Concerning the choice of colors, we discussed it with our partner factory many times. However, unfortunately, we need more quantity, Therefore, as of now, only the orange will be available... @Otoshi No Kami Thank you for your comment and support!!! @kokobin Thank you for your comment! We would like to create our Moff with users. Your ideas are highly appreciated. Thank you! @kokobin Thank you for your comment and idea!!! Boxing/fighting sounds nice!!! Users' ideas are very helpful for our development. Concerning customizations of gestures and sounds, we plan to offer the means inside our app without programming. @Rae Thank you for your comment! Various plays and sounds will be included for free in our app, when Moff band is delivered! @Patrick Thanks for your comment! Some answers in FAQ were updated belatedly so some people couldn't check it. We're sorry about it. We really appreciate your comment! @Patti @Joe Thank you for your asking! The upcoming android Moff app can work with the current Moff band. So you don't need to purchase different type of Moff band. Thanks! @Nick Thank you for your asking! It's under consideration if we stretch our goal or not! @Jonathan Thank you for your feedback! We would like to use your opinion as reference to improve Moff band and Moff app. It's highly apppreciated! @Sylvain Thank you for your asking. Moff band and Moff app connect in one-to-one relationship at the moment. However, we're developing app which can connect in one-to-many connection. @Abdul, thank you for your asking the questions. We appreciate that. Why do sounds appear from smartphones or tablets? First of all, we put high priorities on extendability of our service (Sounds are just our 1st step) by apps.That's why we fully utilize the capabilities of smartphones or tablets including their speakers. We have done the user tests many times and there's no problem. Please imagine the live music.Musicians play guitars and sounds appear from independent speakers different from guitar itself.It's the same.When you enjoy Moff, you will find this point doesn't matter. And the timing of support for android is under consideration.Please kindly look forward to it. @Ron, thank you for your question! Moff band uses the smartphone or tablets's speaker. We did the user tests many many times. And it was concluded its volume and quality of sound were sufficient indoors. @Osman, thank you for your message! It is a great honor for us! And thank you for your advice. We would like to add high value pledges...now, we are asking Kickstarter. @Dixon, thank you for your comment! We are excited too!!! Please look forward to arriving Moff! @Osman, thank you for your idea! It's highly appreciated! Anyone have success getting the Moff to work with an Android device? I'm still sitting on a useless item that won't connect to any android phone I've tried to connect to. To back what J Dubrow and Keith Laflam said.... Would love to have an SDK to develop against. Android App would be great, SDK would super great! Any chance you would considering releasing the protocol to the public domain so that we may create our own applications? Great job with the band's. Quick question? I have switched from apple to android any idea if you'll come out with a android app in near future? Recipient has not received. Can you provide tracking number? Still have not received anything can you provide any tracking info please. I HAVE NOT RECEIVED MINE TILL NOW DO YOU HAVE ANY TRACKING INFO I gave up on the install of this. It's sitting in a heap of unused junk. I've done the install according to the video three times on two different devices with different IOS installed. One an iPad 2 another an iPhone 5. The concept is cool, but I have to say the user design is atrocious. Still looking for an android version but I managed to get it working on a gen 2 Ipad. Here is a link to a vid of my kids loving these things. We have been playing for almost an hour straight now...great stuff <url>#1, #3 and #5 are not there can we have it via iOS app update in future? Got mine today, Bangkok, Thailand. Can't test it yet, since it requires 7.1 and I'm still on 7.0.4 (I hate to update). Any special reason why 7.1 is required and not 7.0? Anyway, I'll probably update to 8 soon. Just got mine today. My kids are going to love it. Big note: battery cover is opened CLOCKWISE. The three pins align with holes and then you may need to use something to (gently) pry off cover. When putting the battery in, slide it down into the side contact and make sure it is fully seated before closing the cover. Got it today in Sydney, Australia. Are we able to activate and deactivate some sounds in the next update? I personally don't like an idea of having gun sound. @Magaret Takaki @Johanna Stein: Turn the battery cover clockwise till the 3 metal legs of the battery cover are aligned with the 3 holes. Then flip the device over and tap the battery cover slightly, the cover should drop if it's properly aligned. Also, it's easier to insert strap after straightening it. Got mine today in Quebec, Canada! I will test them as soon as I can Got mine....guess what I'm doing tonight.... I already tried a coin(s). It appears that the cover is stuck. Help! Eagerly anticipating a response. I can't get the battery case open! How do you unscrew it? how do you install the battery????? My Moff just arrived. Wow that's fast for the shipping. Too bad, Android support is only available Dec 2014 or my daughter will be very excited to play with this. Only thing to do now is to check whether the hardware is ok. It's mid Sept now. Any revised shipping date? Congratulations on solving the design and manufacture issues. Really pleased about your meticulous attention to detail and the high standards you have for Moff. I was wondering whether you have started work on an Android version of the App yet, and if not when you think you might get started on building it? Any shipping updates? Any revised ship dates yet? Hi there, you did say in the campaign that Moff would work with Android - how far away is that? Cheers, Mat. @Creator. Oh no. IPhone 4 is not supported. Can you support the well known Android phone instead? @Creator. Can I know which iOS is compatible with? I have an iPhone 4 which I have yet to upgrade to iOS7 due to the battery issue reported. @Mikael Nordgren . LOL iMoff. Android support is a must, otherwise you can rename it to "iMoff". Please provide a firm date when you are supporting Android as you are delaying the delivery by 2 months. @Creator. What do you mean you are not supporting Android when you ship to us? The statement is this comment stated you are going to support Android. <url>
