As featured in Stretch Goal 1: $30k - COMPLETED! Everyone who receives an award that includes a Hydra will be able to choose between a black, red, or blue anodized enclosure. Additional anodization colors for Stretch Goal 1 Stretch Goal 2: $60k - COMPLETED Each Hydra will ship with a free installation kit including a phillips-head screwdriver for the screw terminals, specialized mounting brackets and hardware, a mini-USB cable, and three sets of alligator clips for the outputs. Hydra with AC/DC adapter and cables Stretch Goal 3 - $100k Anyone who pledged enough to receive the Bluetooth Expansion Board will be able to choose to receive the forthcoming WiFi Expansion Board instead. The WiFi expansion will allow the Hydra to be controlled from a computer through a WiFi wireless network. If enough time remains after we reach our third stretch goal, we'll add a new reward to include both expansion boards (old pledges can be upgraded). Overview The Hydra is a triple-output power converter designed to make it easy to get the power you need for your next project: simply grab the closest battery or AC/DC adapter, plug it in to the Hydra, and you'll immediately have access to three independent, software-configurable DC output voltages to power your system. With its palm-sized aluminum case, the Hydra provides all the flexibility of a bench-top supply without using up your desk space. And unlike a bench-top supply, you can use it anywhere: its small size and flexibility make it a perfect power solution, whether for a mobile robot or an industrial system. The Hydra fits in the palm of your hand You can control the Hydra using your computer, an Arduino or other microcontroller, or even your smart phone (if it supports Bluetooth 4.0). Using any input voltage between 5V and 14V, each of the three outputs can be set to anything between 3.0V and 12.0V via USB, Bluetooth 4.0, or serial. The Hydra is packed with features, including reverse polarity protection, ESD and surge protection on all inputs and outputs, over-current protection, automatic thermal shutdown, and user-adjustable output current limits. When combined with the included PC software, the Hydra can function as a battery charger for lithium, NiMH, NiCD, and lead-acid batteries. And with 2.5A continuous current capability per output, the Hydra is equipped to meet virtually all project needs, including powering servos, cameras, wireless transmitters, and control electronics. This is the last power supply or battery charger you will ever need to own. The Hydra Compared to a Bench-Top Power Supply Features of the Hydra One input, three independent outputs Control via USB, serial, or Bluetooth (iPhone or Android devices) Adjustable output current limit Current control mode allows the Hydra to act as a current source (drives high power LEDs, etc.) Charges batteries using the included PC software and a USB connection CNC-machined, anodized aluminum enclosure Output short circuit protection Thermal shutdown ESD and surge protection on all inputs and outputs Reverse polarity protection on voltage input Controlling the Hydra from Your Computer Specifications Accepts input voltages from 5.0V to 14.0V Output voltages individually configurable from 3.0V to 12.0V Output voltage resolution: 0.01 volts Max continuous current per output: 2.5A at 5V (~12 watts available per output at any voltage level) Output voltage ripple: < 10mV peak-peak at 100mA, < 50mV peak-peak at 2.5A Buck-boost topology allows the input to be above, below, or equal to the outputs Bluetooth expansion board supports Blueooth 4.0 ONLY A peek inside the Hydra's enclosure Status of Design What you see in the pictures and the video is a completely functioning Hydra prototype. With a functioning design, we are now gearing up for manufacturing. We've already lined up manufacturing partners, but to make the Hydra affordable, we have to bring the costs down by manufacturing a lot of them at once. And that's where you can help make this project a reality! Our funding goal represents the minimum amount we need to produce the first batch of Hydras. If we are able to meet our funding goals, we will begin manufacturing and shipping Hydra supplies starting in April. We are still putting the finishing touches on the phone software, and the Bluetooth expansion board is being finalized, but the Hydra itself is ready to go! iPhone App I'm pleased to announce that the Hydra iPhone App is now available for download from the app store. The app is, of course, free to download and use. You can download it at the following link, or you can find it by searching for "Hydra Power Supply" from the app store on your phone. <url>"Resources" that describes how to use the expansion board. Rewards By now, everyone should have received their rewards. If you haven't, please contact me right away and I'll help you out. With only a handful of exceptions, all Kickstarter pre-orders have now shipped. The mobile apps are coming soon. The Hydra can now be purchased on our website, and we are offering a 32% discount on the regular price between now and January 1st, 2014. For those interested in buying more, this would be a great time to buy! Visit our website at <url>"Videos" tab for videos and the "Resources" tab for resources, including PC software downloads, driver downloads, and another link to the datasheet. Unsupported Baud Rates This represents a rather large oversight on my part, but it appears that the baud rate that the Hydras have been using by default is not supported by most serial port hardware. This hasn't been a problem on our Windows machines, probably because Windows emulates baud rates that aren't supported by hardware (I'm actually not sure why it works, but this is my best guess). Because it works on Windows, this problem only affects users who want to connect using a serial terminal on OS-X or Linux. The Fix We are changing the default baud rate to 9600, which is a very common standard, for all Hydras that are shipping from now on. The PC software will automatically select the correct baud rate, so this will only affect backers who want to control the Hydra from a serial terminal. If you already have your Hydra, the baud rate is 14400. If you haven't received it yet, the baud rate will be 9600. What if I Want a Hydra with the New Baud Rate? If you already have your Hydra and you want one with the more standard 9600 baud rate, then please contact me and let me know. I'll arrange to have a shipping label sent to you so that we can reprogram your Hydra with the correct baud rate. Shipping This week we shipped a little under 100 Hydras from the $169 and $189 reward tiers. As mentioned earlier, we don't have the blue enclosures back from the anodization house yet, so we've only shipped red and black enclosures so far. I included a bunch of pictures below. Enjoy! Testing and Calibration Forgive me for posting so many updates in quick succession, but I thought some of you might be interested to see what we do to test and calibrate the Hydras to get them ready to ship. Each Hydra is a little different - part tolerances cause the outputs to vary a little from what they are expected to be, so to get the best accuracy we run each Hydra through an automated test cycle that measures the outputs and computes calibration terms. I made a brief video showing how it works: <url>"guts" of the tapping tool are ruined (they looked good to me), we'll be tapping holes again by the end of Thursday. In the mean-time, the holes in the enclosures need to be enlarged by quite a bit, and we have a lot more machining to do. So not too much time has been lost. A Quick Change of Plans Hey everyone. In my last update, I indicated that because we were having trouble tapping the holes on the already-anodized parts, we were probably going to glue them. Enough people have responded negatively to that idea that we've changed our minds. We'll make sure the holes get tapped even if we have to do it by hand. That is all for today. Thanks everyone. Hey everyone, A lot has happened and it is time for another update. To summarize, we are in the home stretch and things are moving quickly. There have been a few problems that we are working through, but they aren't deal-breakers and they haven't added too much time to the delivery dates. The Good Our first batch of 100 enclosures is anodized, engraved and mostly ready to go. We produce a lot of aluminum shavings! The Bad We are close, but the one caveat is that we've had trouble threading the holes for putting the enclosures together. We have a tapping tool and a little jig for holding the enclosures in place during tapping, but we keep breaking taps - so far, about one tap per enclosure breaks. And at $15 a pop, that really adds up! I'm guessing that the taps are breaking for two reasons. First, I think that the jig isn't holding them in place perfectly. When the part shifts, the tap breaks. Second, I think that the drill press can't go slowly enough for the size of tap we are using. The solution is a two-part process. First, I'm tooling up to cut the threads on the mill instead of the drill press. This will allow us to get the correct spindle speed, the parts will be clamped down tightly, and the CNC mill will allow the tap to be positioned right where it needs to be. I honestly don't know if this will fix the problem, but odds are in its favor. Unfortunately, the enclosures that are already anodized and engraved can't be tapped on the mill because the jaws will scratch the dye. I think that the only viable solution for these first enclosures will be to glue them together using some kind of flexible urethane adhesive. It will be more difficult to take the enclosures apart if needed, but it won't be impossible. It will also leave the screw holes in the bottom empty. This naturally won't affect functionality, but it won't look as polished. The Ugly Last week the CNC machine was running full tilt, churning through aluminum at 60 inches per minute and 4000 RPM. Suddenly, without warning, the tool holder dropped right out of the spindle. In the mayhem that followed, the end mill (operating under its own angular momentum) drilled through the aluminum and into the vice. Meanwhile, the toolholder started wobbling back and forth like a top. It rubbed on the spindle and got so hot that it blued the steel! Amazingly, nothing was significantly damaged - not even the end mill broke, and some emery cloth and a polishing wheel put the tool holder back into service. Here was the culprit that caused the problem: The drawbar, shown above, is a long metal rod that extends from the top of the spindle, down through its center, and all the way to the taper that mates with the tool holder. The threads shown above screw into the tool holder to keep it attached to the spindle taper. Upon investigation, it was discovered that only two and a half threads were screwing into the tool holder. And, as you can see, those threads were completely worn out. They basically weren't even there anymore. We fixed it by cutting off all the threads using our lathe. We then welded the threads from a bolt onto the base of the drawbar. We extended the drawbar so that between five and six threads are used now instead of less than three. The mill is running again and it is working well. It set us behind about a week on the enclosure manufacturing, but a side benefit is that while investigating the problem, I figured out why our spindle break wasn't working and fixed it. That should speed things up a little during tool changes. Thanks, everyone. We are plugging away. I tire of posting updates about delays and problems, probably even more than you tire of reading them. We really are in the home stretch, though, and nothing is going to keep us from shipping these out! I'll keep you apprised. Assembled Hydras We now have 533 Hydras PCBs assembled and ready to go. They haven't all been functionally tested yet, but they've each passed a careful visual inspection under our stereo microscope. We have a little under 300 more coming from the assembly house soon. Their pick-and-place machine died and they are working on getting it repaired. Fortunately, we have enough boards on-hand to meet all Kickstarter rewards. Enclosures The aluminum enclosure is now the long-pole in getting the shipments out. I expect to be able to complete and ship 100 a week starting at the end of next week. Thanks so much for your patience. We are more behind than I ever wanted to be, but the light is shining at the end of the tunnel. This project really couldn't have succeeded without all of your help. Mounting Tabs A while ago I slightly modified the Hydra enclosure design so that it has small mounting tabs on the sides. I realized that I haven't really told anyone, so here is what the new design looks like: The enclosure above is unfinished and it isn't anodized yet, but this should give you the idea. The new mounting tabs will make it a lot easier to use the Hydra on mobile platforms. Also, the tabs remove the need for the special mounting brackets that were promised in one of our stretch goals. Circuit Boards We are having 800 Hydras made (there were a little over 400 promised via Kickstarter pledges, so this will give us a healthy inventory to work from). Some of them are shown below. This is just a small fraction of what we've received, but we discovered that a number of "do not populate" components in our Bill of Materials were populated anyway. So we have to remove them - the above boards are ready to go following our post-assembly component removal. PCB Assembly Update Assembled PCBs are finally starting to trickle in from the assembly house. They shipped 16 on Wednesday, 33 yesterday, and they say that the remainder will be shipped before the end of next week. So far the quality looks reasonable. A couple had minor cold solder joints on some parts, and another had unconnected pads on one of the ICs. As they arrive, we'll be inspecting each one carefully to make sure that we catch any obvious problems before programming and testing them. We are in the process of finalizing the packaging for shipping the Hydra and its accessories. Taking into account the cost of cutting dies, printing, and minimum order quantities, it gets pretty expensive, but I think it is worth it. We really want a nice, professional solution. I've included a couple of pictures of what we have so far. The Hydra sits inside an insert inside the box as shown below (the Hydra shown is unfinished - the packaging looks a lot better with a black enclosure to contrast with the white box). Underneath the insert, there is enough space to hold the power supply, the USB cable and alligator clips, and the screwdriver for the screw terminals. The Bluetooth expansion board (not shown) will also fit in the compartment underneath. The box is a made out of B-flute cardboard, so with the addition of a thin sheet of packing material above the top insert, it should protect the contents well enough to allow us to ship without an extra shipping box. For international orders, we might put the whole box inside a big padded envelope to offer a little more protection. And that's that! Lead-time for these is about two weeks, and we are about to place the order. If the packaging holds up orders, we can ship using something less professional, but I'm pretty sure that packaging won't be the long pole when it comes to actual shipment dates. We've had a lot of requests for updates, so here is the latest. PCB Assembly We dropped off the PCBs and parts at our PCB assembly house a little under 5 weeks ago. The lead-time was 3 weeks, but if I've learned anything, it is that PCB assembly houses often underestimate lead-times. That has been my experience, at least, which is why we try to do as much in-house assembly as possible - lead-times are much more predictable. I just got off the phone with them and they are promising that the boards will be delivered by Friday of next week (June 7th). Assuming that they deliver when they promised, assuming that there are no big problems with the assembled boards, and allowing a week for testing, we could conceivably start shipping by June 14th. More conservatively, it is likely that shipments will start going out in earnest sometime between the 14th and the 28th of June. I wish I could promise that they would ship sooner. In the mean-time, let me know if your address changes, so that I can make sure your Hydra ships to the right address. Increasing the Output Voltage Range When we started assembling Hydras in bulk, we noticed some problems that I probably should have anticipated but didn't. When stacking the tolerances for all the parts that affect the output voltage together, sometimes they combine to limit the output voltage range too much. For example, the lowest possible output voltage is often above 3.0V and below 12.0V. To correct this problem, I've had to redesign the supplies so that their theoretical output voltage range is well beyond the 3V to 12V specification. Then, during programming, testing, and calibration, the firmware is adjusted so that the supply knows how to reach the proper output voltages given the non-ideal components on the board. I've also taken the opportunity to expand the maximum output voltage of the supply to close to 14 V (14V is the theoretical maximum, but component tolerances will probably lower it a bit). Without the higher output voltage range, the Hydra would be unable to charge 12V lead-acid batteries. So this should be helpful. Assembly Timeline From the beginning, we intended to do the PCB assembly for the Hydra in-house. We manufacture all of our existing products in-house, and that allows us to control quality and to be intimately familiar with the process and lead-times. We've found, however, that assembling the Hydra takes a LOT longer than any of our existing products, and we don't have a pick and place machine to speed things up (not yet). Even after optimizing our line, we've only been able to assemble 8 Hydras a day on average. I thought that building the enclosures might be our biggest bottleneck, but we can do about 8 of those per HOUR - so assembling the circuit boards is taking a lot longer than expected. The result: we are going to outsource the rest of the PCB assembly to a local shop that has a pick and place machine and other nice equipment. The best lead-time so far is 3 weeks. What this means is that all the Hydra shipments are going to be at least a month late. This represents lack of foresight on my part. I apologize. But don't worry - we are hard at work and you will definitely receive your fully-functional Hydra in the near future. I'll keep you apprised of our progress. Please contact me if you have any questions. ESD Tests Today, with the help of a friend with some nice equipment, we did ESD tests on the exposed pins of the Hydra and on the enclosure itself. We blasted each pin multiple times with both positive and negative 8kV, and at one point we even generated a half inch arc from the ESD gun to an exposed pin. I'm pleased to report that the Hydra still functions as happily as ever! We'll probably give it another go and crank it up to +/- 16kV to really put the ESD protection circuitry to the test, but surviving multiple hits at +/- 8kV is actually pretty good. ESD Test Bench Manufacturing We've made some progress on the manufacturing front as well. We did a test manufacturing run of 10 Hydras and identified some issues with our reflow profile that prevented the power inductors from being soldered correctly. They are so big they tend to soak up the heat and prevent reflow. It wasn't immediately obvious that there was a problem, but underneath the inductors the solder paste would flow around and sometimes short the two inductor pads together. The result? When the buck-boost converter turned on it would drive high currents through a short and destroy itself. We've figured out a better way to handle the inductors, so this won't be a problem in the future. Using a serial terminal to control the Hydra I just recorded a new video demonstrating how to control the Hydra from a serial terminal. Have a look! Panelized PCBs Have Arrived I miscalculated and this took longer than anticipated, but we've finally received the final revision of the Hydra PCB, panelized and ready to go. The stencil should arrive on Thursday, and then we'll have everything we need to start manufacturing in earnest. Thanks everyone for your patience. Here they are in all their gold-plated glory! Bluetooth Expansion Board The finalized Bluetooth expansion board design is ready and is shown below: We are using an OEM Bluetooth module from China to keep the costs reasonable. The downside is that the factory lead-time is fairly long. We don't expect to have all the parts for the Bluetooth expansion for another two weeks. The implication is that we probably won't be able to get most of the expansion boards delivered until next month. I'm sorry that we are behind - this is principally a result of poor planning on my part. I didn't anticipate the long lead-times. I'll keep you updated as we go. Please contact me if you have any questions. The parts have started to arrive! The aluminum stock for milling the Hydra enclosures arrived yesterday, and today we received most of the parts we need to start assembling the PCBs. I did a rush order on a new PCB revision and it should be here tomorrow. I'll test it over the weekend and make the production PCB order on Monday. Because we can expect at least a week lead-time for the production PCBs, we are a going to be a little behind on assembling the actual circuit boards. We'll definitely start shipping finished supplies before the end of April, but there is a chance that some won't go out until May. I'm going to do everything I can to get us back on schedule. While we wait for the PCBs, though, we'll be setting up our test fixture for programming, testing, and calibrating each Hydra. I'll send more updates as we make progress. Half a ton of aluminum stock Electronic Components Thank You! 479 backers 921% funded at $92,154 Thanks to everyone for your support. We are excited by the amount of interest the Hydra has generated, and we are working hard to manufacture the Hydras and get them ready to go. Aside from building the boards and the enclosures, we'll be manufacturing test fixtures to automate the program/test process, to "shake test" the Hydras to make sure they work after being exposed to vibration, and so on. I've also made some changes to the Hydra design to improve its reliability (more ESD protection, more accurate oscillator for the controller to reduce COM bit errors, etc.) I've made a rush order for the new PCBs so that I can get them tested right away. Thanks again! I'll post updates as we go to keep you in the loop. Hey everyone. I was interviewed on DJ Grandpa's Crib recently to discuss the Hydra Kickstarter campaign. I talk about some of the history behind CH Robotics and the motive for building the Hydra. If you are interested, have a listen! <url>"productized" form. Again, thanks to all those who have participated so far. We are excited to see how things progress from here. @Stevie The iOS zip file actually contains the Hydra's firmware source as well (for Atmel Studio). James, you will be happy to know that your Hydra is shipping tomorrow. :-D Thanks, Chris! The feedback is very much appreciated. Hi Larry, They haven't all shipped. We had some problems with enclosures and are waiting for the last batch of new enclosures to come from the anodizer. It'll definitely happen next week. Our first priority is to get the rest of the preorders shipped, which means working out the kinks in the bluetooth expansion boards and finalizing the iPhone and Android software. We'll look into the OS X version of the control software after that. In the mean-time, you can access the basic functionality of the Hydra from a serial terminal. Glenn - I'm not familiar with KCL experiments, but note that you cannot connect the Hydra outputs in series - their grounds are tied together. Hi Nick, There will be once all the bluetooth stuff is ready (we aren't quite there yet). The bluetooth expansion board will be available for purchase from www.chrobotics.com Ah, sorry. I still need to get the rest of the documentation finished. The baud rate is 14400. Brett, we don't have any adapters for the AC-DC converters that come with the Hydra, nor do we have an alternative version that is compatible with different types of outlets and voltages. Backers with different types of outlets will need to use a converter. Fabian, send me a message to change your shipping address if you haven't already. Yes, definitely. I'm not completely sure on the timeline since right now we are focused on getting everything else out the door, but once we are caught up we'll be looking more seriously into it. Thanks for pointing that out, Keith. I'll change the wording so that it is more clear. I'll also change the expected ship date to be more realistic. Hi Hashish, The price on our website was a pre-order price like what was on Kickstarter. In case you might feel slighted, note that the price on our website did not include shipping, so the Kickstarter preorder and the preorder from our website would have worked out to be the same. The Bluetooth board does NOT include bluetooth communication at the $179.00 price point. Hi Keith, Yes, very much so. We are getting very close to shipping the first pre-orders. Stay tuned! HI Glenn, Yes, the assembled PCBs are starting to trickle in. We received the first 16 yesterday and are in the process of testing them. They should all arrive before the end of next week if all goes well. And they should arrive this week, if they are true to their word. :-) We are still waiting to receive the completed PCBs from the fabrication house. The Hydra won't be able to top off a 12V lead-acid battery, though it will be able to charge it most of the way. Not since last week, but stay tuned - there are more updates on the way. Hey Paul, Unfortunately, we've been held back by some long-lead parts. We are crossing our fingers that they will get here next week. After that, we'll start cranking them out. Regardless, we should be able to start shipping well before the end of the month. Haha, thanks Charlie. I did learn recently that designers basically hate Comic Sans. What font would you recommend? Maybe in the future. We've actually already ordered the power supplies we'll be sending with the rewards, so its a little late to make the switch now. Ah, I see. Yes, the iPhone/Android device could definitely log the data. We weren't planning on adding that functionality, but it probably wouldn't be at all hard to do. Hey James, sorry about that. I missed the question. The Hydra doesn't have enough memory resources to log any appreciable amount of data. Any kind of serial datalogger could record data reported by the Hydra, though. I think Sparkfun has some decent data loggers for cheap. Hi Ken, The power supply outputs are not isolated, so the outputs can not be connected either in series or in parallel. Thanks, James. The Hydra can't discharge batteries, but it does apply the correct charging cycles for lithium cells (CC followed by CV while tracking power delivered). Yes, it will. When you change the voltage (or current limit), the background color of the display box will change while it updates the supply. After it is updated, the actual supply voltage and current will be displayed. This isn't happening in the video, but the software does it properly now. @Tim, Yes, the expansion port consists of four pins, Vin, GND, and USART tx and rx. Any expansion board must actually communicate serially. The protocol will be documented. The USB connection is not FTDI, but it does show up as a serial port on your computer. @Timothy Giles, The connectors are screw terminals, with the exception of the USB and expansion ports. If enough EU customers sign up, we might include a plug adapter, but the same wall adapter will be provided. @Colin, Yes, the Bluetooth expansion and other accessories will be available for purchase later as well. Yes, it does. It should even handle the transient spikes from the alternator. That's a great idea Keith! It's probably a little late to make that happen on the Hydra, but maybe that's something that could be done in the future. If not by CH Robotics, then maybe someone else. I'd love to see it. Maybe when we hit $30k (which should happen soon at this rate), we can make it a priority to make a cheap external knob interface for the expansion port. If it doesn't need an enclosure, we could knock it out quickly and for cheap, and send it out with all the Kickstarter Hydras we ship in April. I'll look into it... Yeah, we could release a schematic of a knob-based expansion fairly quickly. The design would be simple: 1) Three digital POTs forming three resistive voltage dividers. 2) An MCU (even an Arduino) to read the voltages 3) A UART connection from the MCU to the Hydra to control and read the output voltages and, optionally 4) Some kind of display to show the output voltages. Could be a 7-segment or a small LCD display. I'm guessing that someone with an Ardiuno background could throw something functional together in a day. Literally. @Nathan, The Hydra can't do negative voltages right now, but future versions might. We'd need to remove one of the positive supplies and design an adjustable negative output for it. You aren't the first person to ask this, so we are looking seriously at making a version with a negative output. Hi Brad, Yes, the aluminum case is grounded to provide shielding. Also, we could definitely throw together a quick knob-based expansion board that would work, but I'm not sure that we could have it ready by April, and if we could, it may not be as sleek and professional as the Hydra itself. BUT, we definitely plan to release that kind of expansion eventually, probably a few months after its official release in April. Thomas, that's a possibility we've considered. We shied away from offering an enclosure-less option because we really wanted to go for a nice, professional feel. But we may make an OEM version available when we start selling them through our website. The aluminum enclosure actually adds quite a bit of weight, and for some people, that really matters. Here's a thought, though - if flelxibility is desired, there are other things we can do that might make the supply more convenient. Right now, a downside to the Hydra is that you have to be connected to a computer or phone to visualize the output voltages and currents. This was a tradeoff we made to keep the costs and size down. But since the Hydra can communicate with any serial device over its expansion port, it would be possible (and even fairly easy) to design an expansion board with control knobs and even a small display to show the output and input voltage/current levels. Would this interest you? Kenneth and Brad - Adding an option to allow the supplies to be serially connected would be great, I agree. Unfortunately, this would require a fairly significant change to the switching topology, necessitating a substantial redesign (unless there is some way to do it that I'm not aware of!) Perhaps a future design will accommodate that requirement. Josh, Your point about security is a very good one! We hadn't considered that, but now that we're aware of the problem, we can add a feature for requiring a customizable password to connect to the device. Great feedback1 Hey Josh, Good questions. See below: 1) The efficiency is in the mid 90% range for output currents around 1 amp. Naturally, as the output current decreases, so does the efficiency. There is a special low-current, high efficiency mode that improves the low current efficiency, but the max output drops by quite a bit. 2) The limitation here is going to be the serial connection. Even via USB, the connection to the Hydra is converted to 38400 baud TTL UART. Given the required packet size of about 8 bytes, it will take 2 milliseconds to send each switching message to the Hydra. This means that the absolute maximum rate you could achieve would be 500 Hz. And this doesn't include turn-on and turn-off time. 3) There are a couple fault conditions. If the supply overheats, it will drop its output voltage. An overcurrent condition will also cause the voltage to drop. In either case, the controller will detect the change and (if connected to a compute) send a message indicating a voltage fault. We could have the supply be disabled if a fault is detected as well - that would be a software addition. 4) That's right - as long as the voltage fed back into the device is less than 14V, it should be fine. 5) Hmm, that's a good point. With a 12V max output limit, charging 12V batteries would take quite some time. I'll have a look at this. 6) Input, output, and other status monitoring happens via the computer interface. To be informed of the power status, it must be connected to a computer or some other device capable of reading the serial packets. 7) We don't have any specs on the humidity operating range yet (though there shouldn't be any major limitations). The temperature operating range goes from m-40 to +85 C. Hi Thomas, The board is actually not frail - the tinned lines just lack the soldermask (this is to allow an electrical connection to the enclosure and for better heat transfer). At 2.5A, you can expect to see transient switching spikes on the order of 100mV. Their duration is very short, but they are there. We'll be recording some actual data soon to include in the datasheet (also in the works). My Hydra still works. I used the Redshift Serial Interface V3.1.5 for controlling it via Usb. <url>"damnit, where's my Hydra". Hard not to be a little frustrated as it was due in April, and I just blew something up (my own stupidity) by trying to improvise a Hydra. Caleb I'm holding you accountable for letting the smoke out of my UCC37321P, may it weigh heavily on your conscience ;) I just hooked up my Hydra tonight and have to say it is pretty friggin amazing. This is one slick product you have here. I really hope this sells well for you. /thumbsup Hi Caleb, Still awaiting word on my Hydra with bluetooth expansion board(^-^) The Oct 31 update indicated all would be shipped by the following week -was that the case? Thanks in advance for your reply. Congrats on the Project. Larry Any update on the bluetooth expansion boards? I've received my Blue Hydra and so far it looks nice. I am using a mac and attempting to use the driver and Hydra program on a VMware installation of win Vista has resulted in two BSODs. Is there a timeline as to when we will be able to use the Smart Power Supply Control Software natively on OSX ? Any update on the Bluetooth modules? I'd love to have my Hydra to use... Hi Caleb. My black Hydra landed in my hands yesterday. I'm in Italy. I had to pay about $35 in vat and taxes. I'm VERY happy for the product. thanks. Mario Hi Caleb.. I just started Electrical Engineering and I'm wondering if it was possible to use the Hydra for KCL experiments. I've been given the impression in my lectures that having 2 or more different voltage sources connected in series is a bad thing, perhaps I've misinterpreted the forewarning but in anycase, is there anything I need to know before I put 2 or 3 voltage sources in my circuit using the Hydra? Hi Caleb, mine just arrived in the Netherlands. Congratulations on finishing this project, it must at times have seemed an endless journey for you. It's even smaller than I imagined it. Only one word applies: AWESOME! Look forward to using it in my next project. Caleb. Hi from Sweden, wanted to let you know mine arrived, perfect condition. 70 dollars (440SEK) of import tax (darn government). Used it for the first time today. Fantastic case, love the material, finish looks and feels bomb proof. The software works well, great to see the videos online. Downloaded the instructions, well written and complete. Good luck for the future, thanks for you and your colleagues hard work. I have now used it, and it's... BADASS! I used it for a custom photo box, I have it controlling 3 different lights, LOVE IT! PWM would of been even better though. I received mine, but haven't had time to even unpack the box, but I appreciate it and it looks great! Sweet...my Hydra showed up yesterday and works great. I have already put it to work powering my project: "The Phone Cop" Thanks. Any one know of some low profile banana plugs that would work well with this? Caleb, I've already received my Hydra and it looks so cool... Unfortunately I don't have a windows box. Is there a way to just purchase the Bluetooth/Wifi module so I can use an iOS/Android device? Thanks! Thanks for such a nice product, Caleb. Just got mine, and it's working flawlessly. A few months ago you mentioned it'd be possible to monitor status via the serial connection. What is the speed of the connection? I tried 38400 (and everything from 9600 to 115200), 8N1, no control flow, and I only get garbage. Seems it is outputting something, but I'm not being able to read it properly. Being an aussie, the power adaptor will not be compatible for me, without an adaptor for Australia. Are these kind of things standard? I'd prefer to slot out the US based one, and replace with the AU version, rather than a bulky international travel adapter is that is possible. Will have a chance to change my shipping address if I recently moved? Caleb - I was wondering if you were still planning on producing a WiFi control module? I know it was tied to a $100k stretch goal, but wasn't sure if that product was still on the table as a future add-on even if you didn't reach the funding goal. The wording on the website would lead me to think that it does include Bluetooth. It says so twice in the description, and I don't see anything that would imply there exists a non-Bluetooth Hydra (or an add-on Bluetooth module). It also says (twice) that they will ship in July. The pricing appears to have been updated recently though - it shows $198 to me. I am confused about the website description. I though the Hydra retail price was to be $200, but the website shows its $179? Also the description shows that the Hydra includes bluetooth communication under the $179 price point. With the shop hardware repaired and operational again, is there a light at the end of the tunnel now? (and not the oncoming train variety) how about an update? I'm excited for the new Case! any updates? its been 2 weeks. almost forgot i backed this project. So it is May 30th guys, what is the status of things? :) Just a question, don't you need above 14V oftentimes to charge a SLA (14.7V)? <url>#) and maybe able to re-use the data communication code. Well, if you are going to really put more than a few seconds of thought into your application's UI, then you might as well do it right... Segoe UI is the standard font for Windows 7 and Windows 8, as well as Office 2013. Segoe UI should be used for primary UI elements such as buttons, dropdowns, etc. For short sections of editable text, you should be using Calibri. If you have large sections of text (more than a paragraph or so), then Cambria is what should be used. Windows 8 UI Guidelines (typography): <url>"Modern" layout): <url>"official" guidance for Desktop apps, but most seem to be adopting something that very closely resembles the guidelines for Modern Windows Store Apps in my second link. Caleb, I'd recommend a monospace sans-serif (equal width per letter/character, and no extra decorations). Consolas looks like a decent compromise of computery/LCD feel while being modern and readable: <url>"instructions" I use to be into Arduino then I moved into CNC stuff and it all just sits in a container awaiting my return. Great job on fast responses BTW, it pays off, trust me. :) I understand the "official stuff", how about a schematic, and free software, or? hi! i was planning to use this as a roaming pwr supply for my old arcade and PC's machines while i'm repairing them. The supplies are generally in a horrid spot and a pain in the neck to get to, so this would solve a lot of fiddling. Any chance you could set the voltages to minus ranges? (i.e. the boards require a -5v and -12v range too) thanks! "expansion board with control knobs and even a small display to show the output and input voltage/current levels. Would this interest you?" DEFINITELY! Since your limiting this to Bluetooth 4.0, that stops about 75% of us from using it away from the PC, which is a HUGE drawback, and controlling from Bluetooth was actually the ONLY reason I pledged, then I found out about the 4.0 deal and downgraded my pledge in hopes that you find a solution for it, The idea is AWESOME, but if I can't use it the way I want/understood then.... Does it act like a Faraday cage in someway aswell? Can an open frame be made available at a lower cost. Lowering the cost would make them practical to leave behind with each project, and then buy a new one for your next project. Put your logo on the silk screen. What level of security will there be on the bluetooth expansion? How much trouble would a third party have to go through in order to modify someone else's voltage settings via bluetooth? Regarding my list of other questions (below), if you've got a forthcoming spec sheet that will cover it, then rough answers are fine. Very cool item. I really like the feature set. Perhaps my only wish was that the price was a little more accessible to hobbyists. Anyhow, my own questions: 1. How is the conversion efficiency? Are there particular weak or strong spots in the efficiency curve? 2. How fast can I alter or duty cycle an output? (What is the maximum rate you can send changes, and what is the typical/maximum delay for the new voltage to be realized in the output?) 3. What happens when I draw too much current? Voltage sag? Timed breaker? Software controlled breaker? Breaker flipped until the unit resets? 4. Since it has a battery charging mode, I'm guessing that feeding outside voltages into the outputs won't hurt it? Even if they mismatch? 5. I wish the voltage output cap of 12v was just a little bit higher. Will it be able to effectively charge 12v batteries? 6. Is there a provision for input, output, or other status monitoring? 7. Environmental operating range? Temperature, humidity? Thanks. I agree with Kenneth, Functionality is why we are all here. Instead of colors, how about adding the ability to series and parallel the outputs? That would be more useful. I see. From the pictures the tinned lines looked like cut-outs! ~Thanks Great product! Can you explain the PCB mounting concept. It's hard to gather from the pictures. The board shape seems deliberately frail. Did a consolidated board shape suffer noise problems? What is ripple at 2.5A? (The listed max current at 5V)
