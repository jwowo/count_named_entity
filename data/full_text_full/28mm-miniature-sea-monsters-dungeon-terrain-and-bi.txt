We believe that we are offering something very unique in the marketplace and we are offering it through this Campaign at cost-to-produce, with a money-back guarantee if you are not satisfied or if we are late in delivering. Please take a look at some of our mini work on our successful Ice Age Mammal KS. Below, is reference art for the fungus and furniture, and reference art and Works-in-Progress for the Sea Monsters. All final sculpts will be in cast in resin. If you have any questions, please email Lars at <email> Clarification between the New $15 Pledge and the Old $30 Mushroom Pledge: Old 75$ Pledge adds the Lair Terrain and Walls to the $30 Pledge level. "What if I hate the sculpts?" We are running a 100% money-back satisfaction guaranteed program with this one because the sculpts will be completed by October 1, 2014, i.e., after the end of the KS. If you get minis you do not like. Send them back and we will refund you money, no questions asked. That being said, Lars is running the production moving forward and will be on top of the new sculptors to provide frequent updates. And, as per request, Lars will be available on comments everyday and via email everyday until miniatures are in your hands. Hello and welcome to ADW GAMES Sea Monsters, Terrain and Big east Kickstarter. This kickstarter has a very simple goal. We are previewing our 2015 catalog with 10 historic sea monsters, 3 sets of dungeon or cavern furnishings and 5 giant versions of historic animals. Our Sea Monster Collection is based on historic sea monsters reported and cataloged between the years 1558 and 1758. Our approach to sculpting the Sea Monsters is to follow the original illustrations as closely as possible, and to provide a scale useful for a tabletop 28mm game. Only the Sea Bishop from 1562 has been updated. For that model we exchanged the cloth cloak for a the ever-popular cloak of tentacles. As these are big creatures, we will be casting each Monster individually in Urethane resin. The exact method of casting is discussed in the FAQ section, and links are provided for anyone interested in the details of the casting methods being used. In this Campaign, the Sea Monsters are being offered at cost to manufacture. You will also find dungeon and cavern furnishings that have been requested by a large number of gamers and large versions of historic animals that would be appropriate for large-scale warfare, conversions, dioramas or boss fights. And, as requested everything is offered ala carte- so you can pick-and choose and customize your rewards so they fit your needs. Thank you for your interest in Sea Monsters, Terrain and Big Beasts. The Ten Sea Monsters These can be ordered as Epic Size or Giant Size. A size chart will be up later this afternoon, but Epic is usually over 6" in length and Giant Size is under. Epic is meant for Sea Battles where the Monster is attacking a ship. Giant is for smaller battles or for use as water steeds. 1-3. Three Clergy Sea Monsters 4. Porcine Whale 5. Giant Cuttlefish 6.

Hello Our current sculptors, Eric and Soto, have cast hard wax version soft the casteline models and from them have created masters which have been sent to Asia for production. It has been decided that we should use a company that does this all of the time, rather than have a part-time person committed to the company- esp. since the company will only be producing enough resin figures to satisfy KS. Once we have the samples in-hand and approved, we will have a date for delivery provided to us by the manufacturer. After all minis are delivered, and reviewed by this community, if anyone wishes a refund, refunds will be provided as company revenue allows. In no instance do we want people to be stuck with paying for something that is not to their taste. And, we acknowledge and respect that our taste is not the taste of everyone. In no instance will the company cease business until all KS pledgers are satisfied one way or the other. If anyone chooses to upgrade from resin minis (which we assume are being used for gaming on tabletops) to metal and/or fine metal minis, credit can be applied and the change in reward will be made. Exactly which minis will be available in metals will be posted on the adwgames.com site later this month, again under the auspices and direction of our two primary sculptors, who will be handling fulfillment and satisfaction moving forward. Soto T. has joined the team to finish off the remaining sculpts. The above are 99% finished, only requiring some small wax adjustments before masters are cast. The Watchdog is a statute-sized monster that may or may not animate depending on how you play your games, or decorate your hobby areas. The remaining sculpts will be up next week, then we go to production. And, yes, as some of you have already posted elsewhere, our new sculptor did come from 20 years at Disney, this may be reflected in the approach and aesthetics. Hello. This is Susan Taylor. I am handling fulfillment of this KS Campaign moving froward. This Update is to inform you that as of last week, there has been a change in management for ADWGAMES, and subsequently, this Campaign. We will have a significant Update of miniature photos posted on Oct. 10, 2014, comprising, close to 100% of the miniatures and stretch goals for the Campaign. Shortly thereafter, we will begin production and delivery. Thank you for your patience. <email> I think I can finish all of the furniture tomorrow and have it all finished and detailed by Wednesday. The Grid is 1" square Battery died on camera. Two shots. Will Update, again, tomorrow. Now things go fast. All armatures are complete. We are all detailing, all the time, until completion. Turtles: For turtles you can choose a single Epic Snapper Turtle or two Large Snapping Turtles. We are making one regular large and one Alligator Snapping Turtle. The photo is for size reference. Were-Sharks: We are giving away three were-sharks to everyone on this KS. In three different poses. They are approx 28mm high. Wax: All skin texture, shell textures, claws and final detailing for the above figures will be accomplished at the wax level later this week. I will do once a week updates through KS. The rest of the updates can be tracked here: <url>" square. Keeping in mind that these are giant versions of actual mushrooms, and I think most will be used for cover or ornament. I assume this basic size ratio to the 1x1" is appropriate to your needs? Let me know. This is a sculpy blocking. Details will be finished in wax. Lars will sculpt the turtles and the Kelpie either tomorrow morning or Friday, so everyone can comment and we can make adjustments if there is a consensus. Thank you All for your interest in Sea Monsters. All sculpts will be compete before October, so keep looking for Updates! At the request of ~50 Pledgers, the cost-to-produce prices will be kept in place throughout September, for those seeking multiples- so you can decide what you want as the sculpts are revealed. This will apply to add-ons and multiples only. So, if you love the mushrooms or furniture and want another set at cost-to-produce, or if you purchased four sea monsters and want another four, this would apply to you. Thanks! Free Kelpie for everyone at $4,000 Two free Snapping Turtles for everyone at $4,500 Lars will sculpt the Kelpie tomorrow, if we make the goal, and the Turtles on Wednesday, if we make that goal So, no waiting. We are hitting all goals, so we need new freebies. How about free snapping turtles for $4.5K? Open to all ideas for 20 minutes. New Add-Ons have been added any of the Ice Age Mammals and a Polypus. We are waiting to hear from everyone on the SeaBear or the LobsterMan. Or just a set of Trilobites and a mean Nautilus? Let me know what you want to add to the stretch goals. O.K. We hit the funding goal. We all have crabs coming our way. Now, the fun part. I am around all night to build stretch goals with you. Let me hear from you re: what you want, and if I think we can sell enough after the KS is over to not lose money, I will had it sculpted and cast for you. Let me know! If we reach our goal of $2,500, we will give everyone who has Pledged three free giant Crab minis. You know everyone wants free crabs, tell your friends where they can get them. :) Clarification between the New $15 Pledge and the Old $30 Mushroom Pledge: New $15 Pledge= 10 pieces of normal furniture (one of each); 10 pieces of broken furniture (one of each); 10 mushrooms/fungus (one of each) and one sea monster, big or small. The ref art for the furniture? www.adwgames.com/furniture.jpg Old $30 Mushroom Pledge= 10 pieces of normal furniture (ability to mix and match); 10 pieces of broken furniture (ability to mix and match); 20 mushrooms/fungus (ability to mix and match), 10 stalagmites (see WIP photo, which is pre-wax detailing) and one big sea monster or two small sea monsters. What is we actually hit the $2500? Tell me what you want as a stretch goal freebie this weekend and we will open it up to a vote. I can take on 2 minis for every 200$ above the $2500. So, let's start with two suggestions and I will add those to the stretch goals this afternoon. We believe that once you get your minis the word-of-mouth will more than pay for our freebies here. Read the updates, or email me at <email> if you have any questions. "What if I hate the sculpts?" We are running a 100% money-back satisfaction guaranteed program with this one because the sculpts will be completed by October 1, 2014, i.e., after the end of the KS. If you get minis you do not like. Send them back and we will refund you money, no questions asked. That being said, Lars is running the production moving forward and will be on top of the new sculptors to provide frequent updates. And, as per request, Lars will be available on comments everyday and via email everyday until miniatures are in your hands. Good Morning: It is Saturday the 6th. I am around all day to answer questions and take sculpt requests. If we actually make the goal, I can certainly add a few stretch goal freebies. Let's open the table and hear what you want if we hit the $2500 mark. The link to the " before" reference art <url>"whole" version. We will have "smashed" version as well. So; 10 whole pieces and 10 smashed pieces for everyone. Hello All: I realize during this time of transition in our Company - wherein we are changing sculptors and production methods- we have not been very attentive to this Campaign. We apologize. We will be giving everyone who has Pledged, more than a single $, a single set of mushroom terrain and a single sea monster of your choice- in either Epic size (20-40') or Monster size (6-9') free of charge in October. We will keep the KS running so we can run the survey upon completion and know where to send your freebies. We are on schedule to deliver all of the minis in mid-October, btw. So, if you have Pledged. Never fear. We are on track, just swamped with internal changes at the end of the summer. All the Best, Lars Hello All, Lars, here: I am writing to inform you that all terrain will be designed in Houdini and 3D Studio Max to ensure fidelity, quality and offer options for whole furniture and furniture that "breaks" apart. Models will be 3D printed on an EnvisionTEC wax printer and cast by our team. Fungus, mushrooms, stalagmites and 4 new fungus people will also follow the same pipeline. Those designs will be up next week so we have a good assortment of WYSIWYG add-ons with two weeks to go. Best Lars I looked at some amazing people minis today and was massively inspired. <url>#q=john%20cleese%20screwtape%20letters so- tomorrow is looking like: 1. finish furniture 2. three slugs 3. monster lair stuff while listening to the entire Robert Fripp oeuvre, and maybe John Cleese reading the Screwtape Letters: <url>… I was looking into the survey and hit submit by mistake, not realizing that the system allows only one survey per Pledge level. Sorry about that. We will get it sorted once all the sculpts are complete. A good source for casteline: <url>"broken" barbarian leader's chair and add a new fantasy shrrom- the "walking spore spitter". we have: IAM- the last two terror birds. WIP for the giant rhino. two extra prehistoric birds. Sea- mushrooms, fungus men, fungus, monster lair sleep area, alligator snapping turtle and I am working on a throne now. AR: From what our casting guy tells me, Casteline requires a silicon mold to create a master for casting. So, there is an extra step/expense. I have one more Fungus man that I want to sculpt and we are finishing the shroom details now. I spent the morning on terror birds and plan on working on the furniture after lunch. working on myconoids and fungus and got carried away. I will post fungus and fungus guys tomorrow with some furniture and the Alligator snapping turtle. Then I work in IAM stuff, and then back to the stretch goals here, which I will post with the majoutiry of the furniture on Sunday (he says hopefully) terrain- sculpey or fimo would be the least expensive I would think LOL! I have been using casteline for a while now. So, maybe it is easier for me. I will upload a new fungus man in a a few hours, along with some furniture. I am also finishing an IAM model today, as well. So, lots of stuff to show. working with the casteline now. Ungodly good stuff. Detailing the shrooms and I am amazed. I only used this stuff for big pieces, but it is amazing for 28mm. I am doing some IAM stuff tomorrow and will finish the shrooms (for this KS) so everyone can be happy with the next update. I am also going to sculpt the limbs and animal joints for the Monster Lair tomorrow. Going fast now. :) I like that, Will! I will photograph it tomorrow and put it up on the adwgames.com site. I think it is cool. It looks like wax is arriving today, so I think I would like to detail a few items and post 6-10 pieces all at once. Friday? I am happy with how it is going. I want to show some finished pieces on both KS over the next few days to bring up the enthusiasm level. errata: assembled= can be left UNassembled so_ we have a prototype of the Monster lair sleeping area. It is ripped up bark and a giant rug that fits into a 2" wide/3" long base. We will photograph that later this afternoon. We also have a monster lair chest made of rough hewn log. We stamped a set of broken furniture pieces from a Chelsea Historic District location. And, we have three of the six historic cannons almost complete. the important part of that is: they are being built in pieces that can be left assembled, if you are looking for a ruined cannon that your adventurers may be able to put back together if they have the correct skill set and/or determination. errata: These can be added to, or exchanged for, any monster lair, or furniture set purchased. should have read: These can be added to, or exchanged for, any piece of the monster lair set, or furniture set purchased. While we are waiting for the wax to arrive, we have sculpted a few burlap bags (tied up), a giant magic tome on a rock outcropping and a set of historic medieval bombards and cannons. These can be added to, or exchanged for, any monster lair, or furniture set purchased. The historic medieval bombards and cannons set will be a $10 add-on for anyone interested. I will post those photos on the next big Update, here. I posted Sea Monster WIP yesterday (see Updates) I posted the schedule for sculpting on the comment page (see two comments below your comment) As pieces are being completed, i will post them on the adwgames.com site and, since we are looking at a once a week "update" on both KS, and the Casteline is now arriving on Thursday, I would expect a nice big update on this KS Sunday (and every Sunday thereafter until completion) and early next week for IAM + a Friday IAM Update. So: moving forward, photos will be on the grid with a coin next to the mini. Got it. Working on cuttlefish and angel shark today possibly the kelpie everything else is a wax job for later in the week and the weekend. he furniture and the mushrooms are all blocked out and just waiting for the final wax, as well. So, if I really pump the caffeine with the team, I hope to get all giant sized monster completed, the furniture completed, the mushrooms completed (for IAM) all terror birds and 4 IAM not previously seen completed within a week. It looks like we are on track to have all Sea Monster sculpts done by month's end, and cast immediately after the IAM minis are cast. The idea is to finish a month ahead of schedule on this one, so we can have the rest of October for our Dark Carnival sculpts, and some museum client pieces that have been requested in silver. I can just take several photos...not a worry Hey Zach I think we can make that work. The were-shark fits on a 1x1", for instance. I will cut/paste this into a staff email and use that as a guide. i.e., the photos will have both moving forward I will use a ruler and print a one inch square Gotcha, AR Thanks Zach We have two new guys that I need to keep motivated. RobH Got it :) That is a wax deal. I am hoping to knock out all of the dungeon pieces this weekend, with the team. I will take step-by-step photos. Re: the coin: there is a post saying a 1" grid would be better? Thoughts? Also: a request to keep all of the large sea monsters below a 5" square? Please review (everyone), please review the comment on the Update and let me know if that is what the gaming community would require, and I will make it so. [Lars] 1. I clearly stated that we would not be tending to the "Comment" section of the IAM KS. If it is unclear: we will be posting updates weekly on IAM KS, and updating more frequently on the adwgames.com site. A link has been provided for that update page several times. 2. I will update every Friday until the miniatures have been delivered on both KS Campaigns; 3. The core duty before us, and we know this very well, is the move past the poor hiring choices that have put us behind schedule and move forward with new sculpts and more information. We chose the adwgames.com update page as the vehicle to achieve this, because It appears to the 5 people currently working on various aspects of this project, as if there is a small group of posting Pledgers on the IAM KS that sincerely hope we do not deliver, and are intent on driving hysteria towards that goal. That is counterproductive for our team and for the Pledgers that have placed their trust in us to fulfill. This is why we have chosen the new way of reporting progress outside of the comment section. I just finished the sculpey part of Porcine Whale (so that it could be cast ). I replaced the neck blades with a coral-like sculpt and added a man of seaweed, which I will detail in wax later this week. I think I will upload those photos tomorrow to the adwagmes site. ADW miniatures are produced for several markets, including the toy, collectible, museum, educational and the miniature wargaming markets. ADW produces miniatures based on historic animals and myth that have been heretofore ignored by other miniature manufacturers. Often miniature design will reflect, in the case of mythological beings, a contemporary interpretation of the original artwork. Robh? Did you want step-by-step on a turtle or the Kelpie from the sculpey armature stage, up on the adegames.com site, as well? From Lars: I will certainly ask him on Wednesday and post the response/transcript, Robh. As mentioned several times, wax arrives this week. The team works throughout next weekend. I am certain you will appreciate the results. The silent majourity is the majuourity that has sent emails, stating their displeasure with the state of the IAM comment board. From S. Lantry: Comments on the Updates will be monitored. The comments on the Comments page for IAM, will not be monitored. As mentioned, they have become unproductive, ill-considered, reactionary and repetitive in a way that is counterproductive to the success of any civil communication pipeline, counterproductive to the project and not representative of the disposition majourity of the Pledgers. I reiterate for the final time: 1.Updates will happen once a week through KS. Updates will occur as a posted "Update" not a daily entry in the "Comments" section. Perhaps that is the misunderstanding? 2. More frequent updates will occur on the Adwgames.com site 3. We are not answering the comment board on IAM, as the overwhelming majourity of the Pledgers feel that it is not representative of said majourity, and it appears as if a handful of people are asking questions that have been answered several times. As such, neither the project, nor the majourity of the Pledgers, are being served by that mode of communication. From S. Lantry: To Clarify: 1. We have stated several times that the Updates will happen once a week through KS. Updates will occur as a posted "Update" not a daily entry in the "comments" section. Perhaps that is the misunderstanding? 2. More frequent updates will occur on the Adwgames.com site 3.

As such, neither the project, nor the majourity of the Pledgers, are being served by that mode of communication. From S. Lantry, ADW Chairman: As a reminder, ADW is extremely happy to cooperate and communicate with our Pledgers on both projects in every single aspect thereof. We also recognize that the majourity of our Pledgers expect civil discourse and a certain standard of communication from their fellows, as well as the project Directors. If you remember: È il tono che fa la musica. I expect that everyone who has the wisdon, or capacity, to keep this in mind will be extremely happy with the results of our efforts over the next few weeks. Nergal The Update section allows for public comment on both KS Campaigns and will be maintained in good faith. We are happy to comply with that guideline. Following up on the furniture/mushrooms: I will start finishing those on Thursday, once the Casteline arrives in Office re: steps well, the first step is ugly. I built all of the furniture and mushroom armatures out of sculpey. Mainly to see what the sets looked like in scale. Trying to get a feeling for what would be unpacked by a Pledger, and judging their reaction to value-for$15. It is impressive. But, the sculpey armatures are just that, ugly armatures. Would you like me to do the turtles and photograph each step of sculpting for the adwgames update page? Happy to do that tomorrow, if you like. That being said: I remember that the guys said that Casteline would work in the Conley system without melting. If have to check on that one. Again, casting if not my bailiwick. That is a question that is beyond me, Robh. I have a con call with the guys on Wednesday. We could put together a list of questions, if you like, and I will post the transcript. Let me know. Happy to do that. Robh: It seems like the wax construction (by hand) for the furniture is faster. I do not cast, but the casting guys say silicon all around. Evidently, they have spoken to the Casteline guys re: tech specs. One of the forums on this: <url>"As SeanB said it can be done with a heated mold providing it's a silicone RTV mold since that can withstand lower temp oven baking. Results vary though since shrinkage can still occur in spots on larger pieces. If the piece you're working on is pretty much finish and you don't foresee any more revisions or any re-baking you can always do the other pieces in wax. Personally I would just finish that one in the same medium and switch to wax on the next project." NergeL: Your email has been forwarded to the Chairman for ADWGames. the update page is up...there is nothing to show at the moment we have wax and new tools next week, so everyone should be very surprised and happy soon we may have missed a crossover IAM/SeaMonster: <url>… we missed one: <url>"rally"?..I do not know if it a Safari thing or a KS thing. I am beginning to despise the Mac. why did it change Proxxon to "proton"? arghhh…. After a bit of a sleepless night, or, rather, a night or dreaming about sculpting, I "broke" the mold on the broken furniture. To wit: I own every Proxxon tool ever made and planned on building the furniture in hard wax the exact same way I would build miniature wooden furniture. I spoke with a Castaline pro yesterday, and it seems like my plans are right on the money. The process: I will take the hard wax, create boards, in, yes, a pasta roller. Cut said planks on the proton table saw. I would then detail it with a hot wax needle over patterned areas I have stencilled. Some of those pieces I will assemble and some of the those pieces I will "break" and add wood grain and splinters to said breaks. I will heat up the surface of each piece and press a texture mold made from white sculpey, which has been made by pressing the sculpey against a variety of actual weathered wood samples and baking it. I know it sounds simple. It is! But, with this process and that tool set, I can create world-class dungeon furniture, which is rally impossible with another medium, other than wax, as far as I can tell. So: happy morning on this side. I did order wax from a new source, as the NYC source has not returned phone calls and has not traced my order. I expect that to be here by Tuesday/Wednesday, after which I will work 6-7 days straight to finish the furniture, the mushrooms and (with help) the majority of the outstanding IAM minis). I know this may sound trivial, but I was worried about the broken furniture. What a load off. Upshot:? We will have world-class furniture and world-class broken furniture in short order! thanks Robh I will check it in the morning before I head to work. done. It will be up tomorrow. www.adwgames.com/sea_update.html Thanks David I think I am going to ask for a page on AdwGames devoted to Sea Monsters so people can bookmark and look at it whenever they want. Let me make that call now... I have the furniture shapes blocked out for size reference. Now the tricky question: Do you want a photo of this incredibly raw blocking, or do you want to wait for detail photos. I have requests on IAM for both, in fact I have people that demand armature photos and others that demand no photos before the piece is done. Let's set the stage for this KS. Tell me what you prefer LOL! nice work got it no bases we can put them on a sprue Wiliam How many mushrooms is that in total? Love you lillypads, btw I put the beefsteak on an upright log. you can decide if you want two logs or one. the mushroom caps take up the one inch, the base is ~1/3 inch- so- two facing in opposite directions would fill up a hallway? so- I will post the mushroom and furniture armature tomorrow morning then I will think about the broken furniture and do the kelpie and turtle armature while we wait for the wax to arrive I agree RMK I am laying out the mushroom armature on a 1X1 now, just to see what the total set looks like good- less work so: I will work on this after lunch for scale purposes. should not take more than 90 minutes, or so. Maybe I will look for a dungeon map to print out, so I can put the pieces on something for reference. If you know of one, please send it my way. I was building the furniture to the 28mm scale without bases did you want them to be on 1" bases? I could do that, too actually I am going to block out the furniture now, so I can see it all lined up. I will post that tomorrow, at some point. I will get all armatures done and photographed in short order, RobH Let's say: one week. Once the wax gets here, I will have the team finish everything up rather quickly. Quick, fast, clean, detailed with solid communication is what we will have with this one. October is Carnival month- November is that launch (post IAM and SM delivery) This month is IAM and Sea Monster production/fixing. Lots of new photos. Waiting on wax, but will post armatures for everything so people do not get concerned along the way. To make Sea Monster simple and clean and super-friendly, we will be updating 2x a week and finishing all sculpts before the end of the month. We then just put the casting in schedule behind IAM, and we start building excitement for the next big event. Thanks Everyone. Please stay in touch as we post updates. I will prob. need feedback on the broken furniture and the lair as we go along. Talk this weekend with furniture, kelpie and turtle armature photos. Renaissance Carnival filled with mythic creatures, black powder options, super-dark, weird forest thingies and a sourcebook compatible with Pathfinder, Doggerland and current D&D- think tents, carts, cages, illusionists, freaks, monsters, bounty hunters, thieves and golems on the outskirts of town. Ok the plan is deliver these asap. I love feedback as we go along, as long as it is not super hostile, we can make some amazing pieces together. Then I return in November (post delivery) for an amazing carnival themed KS...it will be incredible. once it is on the website, we will get normal-priced sales, I am certain. I will post all of the furniture armature tomorrow, so you can see the scale. Details will be finished in wax. I am faster by hand than the 3D guy is on furniture. turtles.. yup soo cool Dennis I think we need someone professional to run the next KS (after we deliver this and IAM). It is its own monster, really. And...soooo close to turtles. Fingers crossed. shipping should not really increase, Dennis. As long as we mail the pieces out together. Thank you RMK we are just waiting on the delivery of our Casteline wax at the moment. Once that is here we will be cranking out the minis for your inspection. We would like feedback on the "lair" and the "broken" furniture, as we go along. The Monsters are pretty straightforward. We appreciate your kind words. It goes a long way to inspiring the team to work harder, faster and with more imagination. RMK yes. the clarification was for non-IAM readers,s o they are not expected IAM benefits Dennis: 1. 9 small sea monsters 2. the large Sea Bishop (WIP in the photo) 3. the stalagmite add-on set 4. any free stretch goals If I read your comment correctly you were talking about the IAM reqard? that still stands. OK Dennis let me parse through the comments and get your answers. Two minutes. RMK Please keep in mind that the walls were designed to be different looking @ 2 and 3" If you want a specific wall design, please let me know. The worst of them is the thorn wall, as you can imagine. But, we are happy to work with you to get what you want. trevor with our schedule, we can craft the monster lair early next week, if you like. I think the issue is reference art, not time. It should not take more than 3-4 hours? Hi Trevor The monster lair is different. That was a request from RobH, maybe? The idea was to make it look put together by monsters, as opposed to wrecked by monsters. Plus, the limbs and cauldron, and such. RMK we will be offering 3" and 2" walls next month you can have whichever you prefer Thanks RMK That was the inspiration for this KS! I can get that done first thing in the morning. I get in around 7am EST. The majourity of the furniture requires wax. I can get a wall completed after the Kelpie, I guess. RMK yes Hi Nergel I think I am at a loss. There was no PM and I can not find the comment. 1. You can increase your pledge throughout September, 2. yes. verified IAM Pledge gives that to you RMK! I will sculpt the kelpie tomorrow morning. Hi Stuart I believe that is furniture and mushrooms have to check the AR's chart 1. break even 2. switch em out RobH! LOL! First laugh of the day. I made my whole life on the water. And, I am still thinking about investing in a snake water tube technology: <url>#.VA9JRPldWDk I have been looking at this for years. Our firm ran the numbers and it works the permitting is the big issue unless you are in international waters. And, I was thinking of setting up a Red Claw farm when I retire. So, it strikes me as (excuse me and my poor internet etiquette) freakish when someone does not go to water as the source of all joy. That being said, this is, as you know, a break-even KS. You can switch out whatever you like. I think I even owe you a few minis for your support and decency throughout this process. Shoot me an email and I will hook you up. I think you might like the line coming out around the Holidays. As an early advocate, I will give you a "review" set. If you are not interested, personally, it is so cool, please give them to some young relative. I remember every toy I was ever given. They make important gifts to youngsters. I have a few hours, Dennis Let me set into it. Will Also, as stated, I am an engineer, not really used to internet communications. So, there is the chance that what you read is not at all how I mean to sound. So: I am open to the more traditional phone call, if you wish to discuss anything about this project. Hi Dennis I will set to work on that now. Give me an hour or so. I assume the 15 and 30$ format works for you? And, if I do the rest of the levels in that format, that would make sense? Let me know before I start going off on the wrong course. Will I have invited you to call me. I am happy to discuss any subject. Best Lars William. The product will be delivered. I really do not have the time to play around on something this easy and this small except for love of the project. There are a lot easier ways to earn money. This is a project that is producing miniature that did not exist in the marketplace. I joined the team because I want to see these products in the marketplace. And, while this is not the forum to delve to into my background, I have twenty years experience in leading production of a much more complex type, spec marine engineering. This is a simple project. It is a project the current team happens to love very much, and, as professional adults, who are leading the project on a break-even basis, and receiving no payment ourselves, we are very happy to see that over 300 people are as enthusiastic about our efforts as we are about the minis we are producing. If you had misread me, I apologize. If you would like to talk to me during business hours re: this project or IAM, I am readily available. William No attitude here. You misread me. We did have PT employees answering some comments on the last KS. That was a disaster and we have apologized for this. That does not effect our intentions or our ability re: fulfillment. Olog is not a backer. (Olog is in fact a troll in Tolkien fiction). That person signed up for an account today, pledged a dollar, posted a comment, then withdrew said dollar. What you may not know is that we have been getting a lot of hate emails. We got them when running IAM, as well. As an adult, in the real world, who is set on providing everyone here with a high-quality product, this is annoying, but not enough to rise my temper. I understand that is part of doing business on the internet. As mentioned, I am personally responsible for this and IAM. You can freely email me, or we can talk on the phone at any business hour. I have been very forthright and clear about the progress and process related to the two KS Campaigns and I will make certain that only high-quality minis are delivered. I hear you, Zach That is precisely why I was brought on board. As mentioned, I do have a full-time job in another industry, but I do manage very complex engineering projects as part of that job. The early freelancers working with ADW were not good employees, and some were not good people. That is a risk that every new company faces when hiring. Hiring basically is your company. Once the wax arrives and the new team gets to work, things will progress very rapidly. Also, of note: some of your concerns I address directly on this KS. 1. There is a 100% money back guarantee if we are late in delivering 2. There is a 100% money back guarantee if you do not like the sculpts 3. My team will have all of the Sea Monster sculpts completed before the end of the month. Thanks for the post, Mydienon After IAM and Sea Monsters have been delivered we have an amazingly cool line coming out around the Holidays. It, again, explores an historic area which has not been part of the mini world, yet. Keep us in mind. Best Lars Ah! I see, John. You disliked the WIP that I rejected? Good. Happy to hear it. Glad we are thinking along the same lines. You never know what you are going to get when you hire a freelancer. You would be surprised. People actually submit portfolios of work that is not theirs and hand in just awful stuff. Thankfully, I have seen the new team in-action, first-hand. Our new hiring process is to see a basic sculpt in-person in 30 minutes. It works. A good CAD person will take an hour for a solid base mesh of an animal, a good sculptor will take 30 minutes. We had one person attempt to hand in a horrible piece - around 3 inches long- saying it took two working days to complete. War stories of hiring poorly, really. No worries, we have it sorted now. And, again, if you or anyone, wishes to talk directly, I am happy to pick up the phone and talk in good faith, good humour and all due respect. I have not read a single post on any board. As mentioned, I am focused on solutions and deadlines, John. I have posted on IAM that the sculpts handed in from 3rd parties were not up to my standards. Choosing between handing out poor minis to Pledgers or resculpting with new a team, I chose to resculpt. We stay within our delivery goals and we hand out something we can be proud of. Delivering poor quality minis is not an option for me. I appreciate that Zach As outlined on IAM, when we started this project (before I joined the team) there were several "artists" that signed on board and delivered nothing, not a single sculpt. There was one that stole materials from the company. Recently, there were two that handed in poor sculpts. When I took over as project manager, I hired two new part-time sculptors and I am personally devoting time outside of my day job to make this a professional effort and not a free-for-all for (con) artists. Re: finished pieces. this has been addressed on the IAM comment and update section. I am waiting for wax to arrive in the offices and we will fix what we can from the poor base sculpts and sculpt anything new that is required. From Lars: Olag: seems like you are brand new to KS and never backed anything? If you have a serious question, please email me directly and I will be happy to get on the phone to discuss any issues or valid, adult concerns you may have. It is the same offer to speak openly, honestly and directly to anyone, on any business day. In case you need my email again: <email> Hi Olag Lars, here, we are a company in fine good standing with 9 years of no debt, no complaints, no problems. While our competition does have a history of bashing us, and has refused to answer our calls regarding this foul practice, this, in no way, effects our ability to continue to do business, and certainly does not effect our commitment to producing innovative products in the miniature world. We do realize that some people do not want a new company to enter "their" space. We offer the obvious reply that miniatures are everyone's space. And, we specialize in historic miniatures that, for better or worse, the competition has not had the insight or where with all to research and produce themselves. While your comments and the comments on the various boards certainly fit into the current zeitgeist of harassing "outsiders", it will not effect our ability and commitment to produce intelligent and interesting miniatures. How those interested in the tactics and positions which you seem to be embracing, I refer you to the wonderful set of recent "gamer" related acts and articles here: <url>"free items" be purchased as add-ons if we want multiples? yes $10 each 9. Update #2 lists additional free items -- a set of mushroom terrain and a big or small scale monster. Are these in addition to everything else listed as a free stretch item? that was intended for IAM Pledgers 10. Could you post a clear list of everything that comes with each pledge level and add-on, and the pledge price? I'd love to increase my pledge now (before the end of the Kickstarter) but I'm really not entirely sure how much to increase it by... I will try to get around to this. I have promised more sculpts today, as well. New backer here...and confused about the pledge rewards. I can see the $15 pledge is a good deal though, so I backed it immediately. The pledge spreadsheet posted by Aard_Rinn (thank you!) is helpful, but I'm comparing that to the Kickstarter page here and trying to figure out a bit more... Questions: 1. Everything from the Ice Age kickstarter is available at $10 each, including the sculpts that were a $15 add-on (Gompotherium, Andrewsarchus, Unitatherium, etc.)? We are following AR's chart on this one. 2. Big sea monsters are $15 each, or $200 for all ten? Isn't the $200 for 10 a worse deal? $200 gets ten Epic size and 10 giant/smaller size. 3. Small-scale sea monsters are $10 each, or $30 for all 10? Isn't $30 for 10 an incredibly good deal? yes. It is. 4. The mushroom sculpts are $30 for the set, or $10 for the set? $30 5. The 12 stalagmites are $10 for the set, or does $10 get both the stalagmites and the entire mushroom set? the mushrooms in the stalagmite set are simple, small mushrooms was it an email or comment? Negel I just got in and I signed off last night around 7pm, so I did not see an email I will look now _Lars_ OK guys tapping the mat I will be back first thing in the morning. @Robh I called our attorney and it seems 3D pieces that are similar to 2D art is a gray area. I was doing DarkSun sculpts and calling them DarkSun sculpts, which is a clear violation of IP. Not trying to sell them . mind you, just wanted to put them on my CV. So, in a nutshell, I will do a SeaLion as a $5K stretch goal. I will just call it something else, and change something small so it is "inspired by" AR? what is the add-on price for walls? I should add that. detailing the mini L now. Looks like I am sculpting the Kelpie tomorrow morning. one of our freelancers sent in a sea wolf sculpt, as well. Batteries died on the Fuji (why did they use AA batteries?), so I need to run to the store and get another pack. The world turtle is a massive sculpt that will be produced in January/February for the 15mm Doggerland game. Limited to 50 casts. There is an offer for Ice Age Mammal Pledgers that is in effect, yes. New Pledges get the same deal for $15+shipping. Customer Loyalty Offering, really. We will do the same thing after we deliver and start our pre-Holiday KS. Brian At this point, it may be an Arrdrin question. I am going to take an hour an catch up on my day job phone calls. Be back soon. A flying fish/narwhale. interesting. Would have to cast the wings separately...and provide a clear resin stand? RobH! Amazing! Wonder how copyright works on that one. I got a letter re: my Dark Sun sculpts. I could change it a bit. I love that guy. base sculpt for Leviathan posted I will clean him up after he cools down adding the scales, the stomach pattern and the eyes. OK two snapping turtles when we hit $4.5K stretch goal time (while miniL is cooking) how about free giant snapping turtles? you can have a mini leviathan the base sculpt is cooking now give it 30 minutes the big Levi is a lot of resin back from lunch working on items mentioned and the mini -L sculpt for mini leviathan being posted after I eat lunch _Lars_ Thanks Dennis 1/2 done Eli removed! Hi Colin Please read through the updates and comments on Ice Age Mammals I had to fire and rehire freelancers and we are correcting bad sculpts and finishing new sculpts this month (as per the deadline posted on that KS), which will finish that one up. We are actually not only on track, but we will be delivering sculpts of a much higher quality thanks to the housekeeping (and extra investment secured by Dina). You can always buy whatever you missed here on the website next month(once we break free from production to update it the last week of September) _LArs_ Sculpy base sculpts are cooling down. I will add some detail (as much as possible without wax) and post those photos within the hour. _Lars_ I am on my first cup of coffee and baking off the additional sculpts so I can finish the detail level. After that I am cleaning up the KS page with new photos, pledge levels and size charts. all in all, about 4 hours away. _Lars_ checking in I will do both brain coral and mushrooms corals after the details due tomorrow I like the stories and I like the challenge (new guys are reporting tomorrow, so a completely different challenge), gatorade and back to sleep until early EST... OK sleeping until 6-6:30 am EST, tomorrow updates aplenty tomorrow thank you, Everyone for your input this is a fun challenge for me and I appreciate your attention and support to be "playable" you would need coral minions and then the giant brain coral, so I need to sleep on that one. Coral spiders? actually, giant brain coral is amazing psionics abound small the smaller sea monsters are 30-45 mm not huge if you want spouts, that is some-assembly-required but I will include them I have the mini-leviathan as a single piece cast, as well, so, saves time on the consumer side and casting on ours. I like the idea of brain coral being the central, evil computer/mastermind of a campaign that would be cool corral is amazing casting coral is not brain coral is an easy cast <url>", Robh I have a 6am alarm on for tomorrow. I am a morning person after years on the ocean. by that 48hour bell we will ring true. totally of subject but reading "Lord Jim" at the moment. I highly recommend that any DM or storyteller take a look at the language in that book. Good stuff. _lars_ waterlining the sculpts Rob That being said, I am creating masters that can be rounded, later, with wax for the collector. $7 before KS ends $10 Pledge Manager prob $12 MSRP Lars2AR I am on it. shark fins! magnificent in the simplicity! walls, here, are $7 add-ons (412 afterwards) Sable: heard. I think I can get 1-5 done in 20 hours. Up to the level of the IAM sculpts on that page. I will not post anything that is rough. I think I can do: 1. small leviathan 2. slugs 3. maggots 4. small porcine whale 5. a chest from the furniture collection before the 48 hour bell rings. I will need to finish them all with wax for fine detail, though. All I have here is sculpy and some green stuff (which I do not use). (We had a very classical fine art dept in uni. - clay and wax, only. Plus, back then I was building structures that offset my engineering degree.) O.k., so those sculpts, and the size chart. The water bug and crab are definitely wax jobs. As is the water horse. I could draw the mushrooms, or put photos next to the silly silhouette guy, if you think that would be of use. Thoughts? _Lars_ The foil Leviathan was solely for size reference. Showing that 10 inches of fish on a mini board is HUGE, and asking if that was too big to be of use. Is it? I can do the size charts, work on the Pledge charts and give a small version of the leviathan before the 48 hour bell. That would be a fun challenge. All that being said, I do have a consulting job that is looming and as fun as sculpting and KS Campaigns are, I will be preparing for a prototype test of a water power generator for a client this coming Thursday. Just something to pay for my time here :) size ref charts. O.K. That seems simple enough and something I can handle alone. Let me set into that one. since we switched teams/talent (under circumstances explained in IAM), and have gone from sculpy to casteline for detailing reasons, and sculpy/milliput to CAD/Blender for accuracy/detail/3dWax Printer reasons, we are a bit short on the actual sculpts at the moment. Let me see what I can do. I could block out a lot of pieces, but would that be the best use of time? _Lars_ I will need a few hours to work on the reorganization _Lars_ So in the next 20 hours we should lead with the Pledge level breakdown? And include pics of what people get with each? _Lars_ been addressed already, estrus no relation. Hi Dennis I will get on that after a lunch break I have added maggots, but it is very slow today. Wonder if we will make that stretch? the guy shipping had a medical emergency so we called on friday to confirm that it has been shipped. It was not. so, we guess mid-week. I will work through the weekend to bring us up to date. IAM minis are coming after the casteline has been delivered. Most are quick fixes, really. Some need new heads/faces. All need new feet. And, about three need to be crushed into powder and forgotten. This is MORE interesting: <url>"scavenged/stolen stuff instead of the Giant furniture" bit. Will implement that take on the Lair furnishings. _Lars_ I was thinking a building some quick furniture armature today, so you can see size references to go along with the photo references. If that is of interest, let me know. I will finish furniture details in Casteline this week, whenever I need a break from IAM fangs, fur, faces and feet. Good Morning Everyone I, Lars, am up and around and will be manning the stretch goal station for the next few hours. Let me hear from you and we should be able to get a few more cool freebies up on this one. HI Dennis ADW has a shipping import/export consultant attached. That was one of their early strategic relationships, due to the museum wholesale relationships in place. please shoot me an email @ <email> I think I am going to sleep now. I will be around all day tomorrow for stretch goals, concept art, clarification, whatever is needed. Thank you Everyone! I have to check with Dina and AR. I do not have the spreadsheet in front of me. Give me until tomorrow and I will have the answer. instead of Sea Monsters? Never thought of that. Yes. Sure. Polypus added! Epic size will be 7 inches. Giant size 4 inches. Jared, Sir, I think you are on to something there wall concept art ported to this KS Our wall images are the same concept images from the (cancelled) Band of Gnomes. Slightly less than 2" wide in order to fit in Dungeon Tiles, etc.. Let me go cut and past them to this KS. A walrus man would be slow and ponderous, but given to massive rage. Like a D&D Hill Giant but smart and tricky. How about a walrus man, similar to this? <url>"sing" when swung and it could be effective at blocking or disarming like a complex shield/giant main gauche mash-up. If you want to comment, please do. If you want this guy sculpted, I will put him as the $3K (free) stretch goal, with an option to add-on another in a different pose. _Lars_ I am thinking of SeaBear being something like this: <url>"smaller" versions you requested earlier. So, steed-like in scale. Maybe the Leviathan would be in that 5" category. You could call them dwarf versions of the Epic size, if that makes more sense? Hey Kanga (obviously Lars, here_ Here is a photo of a tin foil armature for the Leviathan: <url>" LOL! I will roll up some tin foil now for an armature. I can block it out this afternoon. I need to run to the store in about 10 minutes Thanks Galit email Dina through KS and tell her I am certain she will reward your efforts. _Lars_ so- the giant leviathan I have at about 10 inches long. Would you like me to block out a 6 inch long leviathan? 6 inches=152 mm equals, or about 32 feet long in 28mm scale, right? Or would 5 inches be better? Let me know and I will pull out some clay right now. Thanks Galit Tell a bunch of friends and it will happen. I would do a straight eel in metal. Expensive? yup. Worth it. I could cast it with a hollow bottom to save money. But, would anyone use it? Or would that be a collectible type of piece? I think AR, you mentioned that the big pieces are sort of "one adventure and out"? _Lars_ I personally like the boat idea. Bill: Tentacles are always a casting problem. There will be assembly required for that. AR: the tattoo idea is cool _Lars_ Hey Tim I could do an eel, sure. How long do we want that thing to be? One foot? _Lars_ 1. hitting the goal would pay for the resin and shipping :) 2. I love a sea gnome, though I am not the guy to sculpt small figures. I think we will shoot that over to the Blender guy and the 3D wax printer. Good idea, though. How about a boat? That would be cool...something smallish, but useful to play with? 3. I am waiting on the wax to get here before I post any more WIP. I want to see everyone's jaw collectively drop when the before/after photos are released. Let me know what exact size you are looking for re: the leviathan mount. That is an easy sculpt and I can get one of those done fairly quickly. I could do a quick armature/blocking in sculpy this afternoon and finish detailing in wax next week. Let me know. _Lars_ Thanks Robh I posted an Update. I am around all day to listen to stretch goal ideas. $540 more and I will be happy to sculpt a few freebies. It is all about good will at this point. Thank You Gait You are free to email me or call the office and I will return your call anytime. Look: I am just that close to 40 and I make a decent wage. I happen to share a profound love of folklore and history and myth with the adw people that started this and funded this. And, I can crack a whip when "freelancers" ask for money and deliver nothing. Wow. why does that happen? Whole other story. My main joy at the moment is getting that wax and fixing that cr*p. As a guy that works with oceanographers every week the sea monster thing is dear to me, honestly, as the IAM is. I think we all forget that history unless there is a small reminder there in the home, right? I remember when I was young and we had minis from Disney around. I went to school thinking about the movies we all saw (if you were around ) in the 70s. They were empowering. I remember an Ice Age Elephant book my mom bought me when I was 5, from a used book store well before the internet. Those are important memories. I do not think it is easy to share D&D stories with the young gen, but it is easy to show them am IAM or a Sea Monster and share something that is bigger than a single person or family. I would carry that around as an important memory. I would carry a sea monster mini around as something important. Toss away a selfie, toss away this gen's iphone. Would I toss away a sea monster that I shared with my family? For me: I would have loved to share that as a joke, as a story, as a shared part of history, as something different that they took a moment to pass along. That's why we do this, and choose our topics. There are times when I clearly do not understand the internet, but I understand my craft and I understand why I spend my free time trying to share stories through minis. I appreciate the comment. I will be around for a long time and I hope I can re-enchant by helping all of us remember our shared heritage. Big Beat Obviously influenced from my Aphex Twin post on the IAM KS Choose Big Beast or Sea Monster Just promise to tell a friend Sable Fox Big Beat or Bis Sea Monster not an issue just let me know. WW, Everyone here is kinds "older", so we do not care so much about much except for that trust. The early team was bad. I will admit that. Hiring is always tough. When you get to a certain point you choose to trust people and I guess that is a fault that might be enhanced by the lack of face2face internet. So: we made an err (or two) in judgement, which we are fixing. Being "older", we believe in correct action and fixing something when it goes wonky. I think next year is our year in the mini world. We spent a lot of money on errs and a lot of money on tools. Ideas are not an issue. Stupid,stupid,stupid as it is we all have grad degrees that are growing on 20 years old at this point. I have a lot of experience in casting silver (outside of my engineering life where I basically do math for oceanography/energy innovators), and though this KS is new to me (and D, a dear friend) we believe in the myths, right? Myths are shared things. Shared ideas to talk about. Something other than "news", right? That is what appealed to us when the core team said "what about a KS for deep, deep myth minis and things that actually lived which no kid knows about..." you got it WW Aard you have the "Freebie Queen" award. Stop Pledging. If you pay for shipping moving forward, every production piece we do is yours. Build a new shelf. start? typos IAM will be done this month and Sea Monsters will be done before Halloween I am on this ...and I will be taking requests in November before my team starts the Doggerland and Mythological creature sculpts _Lars_ the problem is with the holiday and bad hires and I need more Castilene shipped I can give you the corporate phone #, and you have my contact info I give you complete authority to internet crucify if I do not see both Ks start before Halloween We are producing everything, so I can stay employed throughout October. I am just giving away freebies. We have the funding and I am driven to build goodwill. _Lars_ understood. our sculptors are just getting back into the groove after we were burned by our first two "sculptors". So we are behind the eight ball on this one, but catching up fast. A horror story of hiring people on the web. No worries. If we do not fund, we still send out the freebies to our backers. _Lars_ not this time, Sable the real issue has been scale. we have had freelancers handing in product that was not to scale and/or sculpy product that was not ready to cast. As mentioned, I came onboard to change over to a Castilene and 3d wax print production process. The real key here is, we are still small. And, I can be reached by phone anytime. And, whatever I cannot sculpt quickly in Castline I will send over to the 3D guys to sculpt in Blender. Which means: we have room and time to work on pieces with our customers. done We can certainly put a heraldic symbol on the furniture. Choose one from the Doggerland symbol on adwgames and we will make it so. Also: there will be a revamping of this KS in a few days that reflects our new production pipeline. I am in the office tomorrow. Had to jump and get the investment clearances for the wax printer. :) @Gailt That is a great question. One of our team asked Shane over at Pinnacle if he was thinking of a new mini line and he said "only if it was pre-painted". I have been able to source a pre-painted solution that allows us to pay salaries. That being said, pre-painted is appealing. We were approached by several museums for provide some Ice Age Mammal sculpts at wholesale- 90% of them want pre-painted. I guess that goes over to Dina to look up while we are deep in the production. pre-detail, yes. I will go in with grey/firm in a bit, bake that off and go in with two-part epoxy to finish it off. It might be wise to finish the mushrooms tonight and tomorrow morning, as well, now that we are a staff pick. btw. I photograph in B&W when the base sculpt is original sculpy, to bring out contrast. As you may know, pink sculpy (original) is flesh-coloured and does not "read" very well. And, As I will be adding layers of differing colours, B&W helps communicate the form better than colour. The crude furniture is part of "Set 3: Monster Lair", though I could add a chest of drawers or cupboard, if you like. In fact, doing it now. 410=$10 @RMK: just calling our casting guy now for the price to produce a 22 piece set, but I think we are locked on 22 stalagmite pieces for 410 on this KS. Furniture that can break apart? Hmmm.maybe rules that allow trolls to break furniture and use it as a weapon? I will look into this and get an answer pronto. wow staff pick! cool! better stay late tonight. :) Preview of stalagmite set. Set will include 12 stalagmites and 10 little mushrooms. Add-on price will be $10. <url>" to fit in a corridor. Could be a spell wall. Wall of Solid Mineral Droplets? baking off the first batch of stalagmites now. Looks like it will be a set of 12 + ten small mushrooms. furniture image updated giant throne will be stretch goal @AR: of course, a throne. obvious one wasn't it @Robh: pre ransack @Colin: walls, mushrooms and fungus men, working on it. will have that update with the first of the stalagmites done OK Let's check this reference art out: <url>#3 and firm to finish. For sculpts that can be finished without extreme detail, we follow the basic steps: <url>"free shame"! Obviously, shame is an option. "Some" will be free and some will be add-ons. Terrain: All terrain other than what has been mentioned will be stretch goals. As they unlock, shame will be free and some will be add-ons. Here is my list. Please advise, as it will be official this afternoon: 1. Kegs (free and add-on) 2. Tree Stumps (free and add-on) 3. Medieval torture Chamber (add-on) 4. Stalagmites (free and add-on) 5. Ransacked tomb (add-on) 6. Evil Artefacts (add-on) 7. Giant book on pedestal (add-on) 8. Bookshelf (add-on) 9. Boar on a roasting spit (add-on) 10. The Big skulls and bones Pak (free and add-on) 11. Water spout and Whirlwind (add-on) 12. Runes (free and add-on) 13. Crystals (free and add-on) Let me know what strikes your fancy and we will make it happen. Thanks Eden! AR: How about a few free myconids to all Pladgers, kind of like the Terror Birds. I could whip up a few today for you to review. _Lars_ Thanks Robh. We will give you Recognisable Debris, for certain. Check back tomorrow morning. _from Lars_ a comprehensive list of dungeon terrain has been worked out. I will upload the list tomorrow morning and instead of drawing, we will actually sculpt as we go, so you WYSIWYG. Some with be stretch goals and all will be avilable as add-ons once they are unlocked. I will be working on the medieval torture room set tomorrow, as well as the Dungeon Lair, which is more of a troll's kitchen with bedroll and a lot of cool details. _lars_ And maybe a burial room with coffins and giant beetles. Pieces of mummies left from a tomb raid? _Lars_ Ohh..that is cool smaller sea creatures we were looking at giant crabs and a set of evil frogs as the first stretch goal Oldest Old mentioned frogs and we have been doing quick sketches and clay studies ever since. The achiyalabopa is also very cool. One thing we need to wrap is more terrain sets, I think. Some of my ideas were: 1. Evil artifact set 2. Sewer set 3. Sacrificial Altar set 4. Brewer's storage room Any interest in those as stretch goal Dungeon furniture ideas? _From Lars_ We will have concept art for dungeon furnishings up tomorrow. And, I think there are two new Sea Monster sculpts that will be ready, as well. And we are open to stretch goal ideas. Hi AR Lars, here. I am running this one, so do not hesitate reach out to me if you need anything, or have any suggestions as we go forward. We have the three sculptors working every day, so we can always find time for cool stretch goal suggestions. They still suck Complete Fraudulent KS. We will never get our stuff, just wish the Law would do something as this came as a pure fraud and they never have even communicated with us. Boooooooooo! Just a reminder in case the originators ever check back - you suck... Intersting artical below regarding a failing kickstarter and later court action. Any backers living in Washington State? <url>"lost"? Maybe $200, including this project. Let's say $400, which could have been closer to $1k if I hadn't been lucky enough to miss the Robotech ks. This is actually an exceptionally good batting average, considering the nature of the projects and issues involved. Do start paying more attention that at least someone is keeping project creators honest before funding concludes (this thing had red flags all over, let's be honest), but don't discount ks as a whole - it's still doing wonderful things and providing amazing value (both in obtaining things and in having them exist in the first place) for our dollars, even considering the bad projects *and* the fraudulent ones. Of course, there's still room for improvement. I just filled out a Kickstarter research survey. And they chose *this* kickstarter to ask about. I hope my answers don't skew the results....since this kickstarter was atypical of most KS experiences... *Shoulda said, "I don't back any projects *anymore* unless I know the project creator..." 3DGeek: Thanks so much for your perspective. I think you've identified the problem: There is no consequence for failing to fulfill for project creators. Backers just get told, "Buyer beware," and Monday-morning quarterbacks come in and say how we all shoulda known better than to back this sort of thing. And project creators? They are considered "successful" based on funding dollars, not delivering. Kickstarter overall is broken because of this imbalance in consequences and therefore power. And this is why I don't back any projects, at all, unless I personally know the project creator. Did the same thing, expect the same result... Hope they fall into clay and get molded...

On the other Diana Walker Kickstarter, there is an effort to report her business to the Business Consumer Alliance. Her business still has a "BB" rating (which is actually pretty good!)...clearly it should be a solid 'F': <url>"Trusted" pile...but it's not so good for the community at large - or for people who are just trying to get started. How do we fix that? Well, I guess we need to be sure that there are consequences for the project owners who lie and cheat their way out of our money. We must make sure that they never manage to sell another thing - not to us, not to our friends, and certainly not in any place where we have a voice. We need to pursue them - if possible, bring the force of the law to bear when what they did is fraud. Not all failed kickstarters are like that. I backed one recently where the guy doing the artwork was severely injured in a car wreck...the project owner had spent 45% of the reward money - but couldn't continue. He's given a careful accounting of where that 45% was spent - and is refunding the remaining 65%. So far, not one backer has expressed upset or complained. Communication is everything. Distrusting new businesses is a bad thing...we need to give them a shot at reaching goal...but how do we avoid the frauds and shysters? My new KS philosophy is to back un-proven businesses - but only with small amounts that I can afford to lose - and only enough so that they can reach their stated goal, not 500% over - once they reach goal, I rarely back them. If they make good on that first project, then by all means, I'll shower them with gold on their second, third and so forth. So let's make the first project a trial - and let the second one earn them the money to truly get started. Just my $0.02 So are we basically shafted? It seems easy for anyone to start a kickstarter project, throw some photos around, and con people out of money. I suppose that's the risk of pledging money at this site. Would be nice if kickstarter were to meet us halfway and offer a partial discount off the fees they collect from one of our next backed projects. There is no evidence that they'll ever do either thing...we're getting no more updates...no refunds...no responses to direct messaging. We're now essentially in the realms of theft/fraud. Refund or produce.... Hmmm - their own website says that their new website will be coming February 10th. I guess they can't even get that straight. Nope... @3DGeek Did that work? Given the allegations made against ADWGames (with the supporting evidence provided) and the lack of response from representatives of the company. I hereby request a full refund of monies paid to ADWGames resulting from my participation in this campaign. Request sent to creator and Kickstarter also.

Given the allegations made against ADWGames (with the supporting evidence provided) and the lack of response from representatives of the company. I hereby request a full refund of monies paid to ADWGames resulting from my participation in this campaign. Request sent to creator and Kickstarter also. since miniatures have not been sent & terms of this KS said delivery by thanksgiving or refunded I am requesting a full refund please They will probably start the refunds the second Tuesday of next week. Hypothetically....if nothing shows up in my mailbox on Weds, does ADW start processing the refunds on Thursday? Or are the banks closed for the holiday, and they'll start on Friday? ------ "ADW Games guarantees that all minis will be delivered by (u.s.) Thanksgiving or we refund. No questions." You have to find them first. Hello all, haven't checked in for a while. Anyone in prison yet for this KS? Was the initial kickstarter made by Lars? Didn't realize that they are basically disavowing their own home page Risks and challenges notice as well. Kinda like stating their obligations for this kickstarter are null and void. LMAO!!! Also, with one of the latest *changes in project management* (Susan) it was said that all promises made by the *former management* (Lars) were "Made without authorization" and null and void. @ 3DGeek- on the home page of this kickstarter at the bottom... ADW guaranteed refunds if they didn't ship by US thanks giving. 'ADW Games guarantees that all minis will be delivered by (u.s.) Thanksgiving or we refund. No questions.' Not like it will happen though.The guarantee of a liar is less than worthless. There is no requirement that Kickstarters refund money just because they missed a deadline. The shipping dates are clearly marked as "ESTIMATED". However, there are sufficient red-flags here that many people have gotten refunds. now been 3 weeks since last update - news on progress to delivery really cant see you shipping product by deadline which means everyone gets refund :) Curiously my experience is just the opposite of William. Although the CC told me the IAM was to old they would look at it anyway. I received confirmation of that refund but the this more recent KS is being investigated and I am in bigger on this one. I recieved notice today from CC that this one was refunded. No confirmation on the dogfood one yet (IAMs), it's still in limbo while the CC investigates more or it could just be too late. I wish it was the other, because that one was a bigger hit. . Good luck everyone on refunds. One down, one to go. ;-| This is my second request for a refund. I will contact my credit card company next to report this as a fraudulent transaction. In looking at the two DAW kick-starters, there are some mini's that are OK and not too far off the mark from the original quality. I'm only down for a small pledge so will see where this one goes. @Rhys As much as the images on the project page have to do with what they planned to deliver - nothing. What do the images in the update have to do with the described project of fungi/ dungeon furniture and classical sea monsters? Regarding the update: Interesting to see you intend continuing this sham. Have to say those sculpts are a bare step up from junk, I have seen 10 year old school kids do better work with Play Doh. Oh, and incase it slipped your mind, I am still waiting for you to provide a full refund of my money. @William: The amount of time it takes for the project to get it's money is AT MOST two weeks. In the kickstarters' I've run, the money was mostly available within hours to a day after the project ended. The two weeks covers the time taken for money from backers who's credit cards bounce the first time around. Amazon has to try again, then email them to ask them to fix it. If they don't get money within 2 weeks, they give up trying. In our case, the number of delinquent backers was maybe 0.2% of the backers and 0.05% of the money we earned. The rest was in our bank in two days or so. Given the allegations made against ADWGames (with the supporting evidence provided) and the lack of response from representatives of the company. I hereby request a full refund of monies paid to ADWGames resulting from my participation in this campaign. Request sent to creator and Kickstarter also. <url>… Hey, weren't we supposed to get an update, too? Oh, look - "We will have a significant Update of miniature photos posted on Oct. 10, 2014, comprising, close to 100% of the miniatures and stretch goals for the Campaign." It's almost like they don't realize that if they write it on the internet, *we can just go back and look at it!*... They are probably doing just enough to try to continue to look legit to KS and any other mark they have on the line. No, it's 14 days, I think... That big explosion happened the day money was due to change hands on this project, as I understand it... Doesn't it also take about a month for them to recieve funds from KS. I thought the funds were held for a certain amout of time while KS takes thier percentage prior to sending the remaining dollars on to the project owners. Some low-security cards may cap chargebacks at thirty days, IDK... *taps fingers* Impatiently waiting for update before deciding to pursue refund. I went in big on both KS's. Anyone else find it curious that the proposed announcement on the 10th (today) is exactly 30 days from the KS closing? Is there mechanical significance to the KS process? I think the 'majourity' of backers are looking forward to an update... Do you know, I'm actually getting quite excited about tomorrow's proposed update... Weird isn't it? Being scammed & entertained at the same time. I'm sure the Marguis de Sade would have something to say about that! @3DGeek Dina/Lars/(insert name here) were also talking about museums displays and gift shop and jewelry, so the thought is that these kickstarters and the web site are just bait for a bigger whale than the measly $26k. The pictures of "ready for sanding" artwork were posted in the first couple of week after the project ended, until they actually got their money from KS/Amazon. After that they went on the rant mentioned in the updates, and have not been heard form since. @Aard: Yeah - I guess so. @William: I'd heard about that - but it's hard to see exactly what they said and under what circumstances. It's certainly another huge red-flag. The thing that kinda says "incompetence" rather than "scam" to me is that they have so many photos of early artwork that they posted AFTER they'd collected all of the cash. Most scammers wouldn't put that much effort into it once they'd gotten their money. There is an argument that they are also scamming the artists...but it's hard to know. Also, adwgames.com has a ton of other stuff on it - which looks very convincingly real. Did that business suddenly decide to switch tracks from reputable to scammer? It's just really, really strange. To me, it stinks of extreme incompetence - but at this point, I just don't know. Fortunately, I'm only out $15 - so I can afford to ride it out and see where it goes. As someone on the Ice age list said - it's worth that much just for the entertainment value! @3DGeek - Mostly folks are doing it as part of a requirement by the bank that an attempt to communicate with the progect owner be made before chargebacks are attempted. The way these people (or person) treated thier backers on the IAM KS, I ONLY hope for thier demise (possibly some jail time, too). They were extreemly rude to many backers. I like many others feel this whole fiasco has been a giant scam. I understand the obvious need to demand refunds as a means to say "I'm spectacularly unhappy"...but don't expect it to happen. Realistically, either this project is a scam - in which case getting our money back will take legal intervention - or they are trying to act in good faith. If it's the latter (and I don't think it is) then Kickstarter's rules say that we're not entitled to our money back until the project is pretty darned seriously late - there are plenty of projects that deliver more than a year late. If you've never run a Kickstarter (I've run three successful ones and two more that didn't make goal), you have to understand that returning someone's money ain't cheap. If you pledge $100, the project owner only gets around $90 (because of Kickstarter/Amazon fees). To return your $100 via PayPal costs $103. So the project paid out $103 on $90 earnings, so it cost $13 to do the refund....ouch! Worse still: 1) In many cases there is a certain minimum cash income (reflected in the "goal" amount) required to fulfill the rewards for even one backer...the cost of procuring art and making molds is the same for one backer or a thousand. If refunds take you back under the "goal" amount, you can't function. 2) When projects surpass their goal, they often pile in stretch goals and bonus freebies...now, a refund may reduce the total earned below that needed to support a stretch goal...but everyone who pledged for that stretch still wants it...so now you need to procure more art and make more molds - yet you no longer have the income to pay for it. 3) On the day the project is funded, the project owners start spending their income on things needed to complete the project - art, supplies, molds, etc. Once spent, that money can't be recouped when pledges are refunded. Returning even a small fraction of the pledges can rapidly become a 'death spiral' for a project - where each refund made makes it harder to fulfill the remaining rewards. This can easily spell doom for the project owners and those people who still believe that the project can get the work done. Again, I'm not saying that's the case here - just that, in general, it's unwise to assume that your pledge money will be returned just because you're upset with the project...even if they are acting ethically and responsibly. But it doesn't hurt to send the project owner a message...

But this isn't that. This group of people have run two nearly-parallel kickstarters (which is always a red flag) - and the other one appears to be in very deep trouble. It's missed delivery estimates - but seems to have all manner of other 'red flag' events happening. We hear oblique references to people coming and going within this business that seems to have a bunch of people working for it...yet the actual presentation looks a lot like one person doing everything. I'd be happy to assume good faith here - but for all of the issues raised over on the other project. We really need a clear, concise statement about what's going on here. @Carl You might want to look over the comments for the other scam by these people - Ice Age Mammals.

Wow...it's not looking good. $4,600 here and another $21,700 on the other KS. At over $25,000 these people need to explain very clearly and very soon every single aspect of what's going on here - or they're going to find the cops knocking at their door fairly soon. Kickstarters that are delayed or screwed up is not uncommon - but this is looking nastier than that. I can only suggest to the project owner that she writes a CLEAR, SIMPLE update that says PRECISELY what's going on here. Being evasive, confusing and making oblique comments about changes of management ain't gonna cut it. This was a bad situation before, now it is just surreal........do these scumbags seriously think anyone is fooled anymore. I have already requested a full refund from you.

I look forward to the 10th October update. ...or not Oh that's right. Thank goodness, they looked dumb. On a good note, Kickstarter's experiment with circular avatars has ended.

I and many other backers have already reported this project to you. I am specifically asking what are you going to do about it? I believe that your integrity team did not fulfil basic due diligence in validating this project. As such I and other backers, were led to believe you supported and vouched for the worthiness of the ADWGames people (even if not the financial viability of this particular project). Especially as you allowed them to launch 4 different projects within a short space of time. I am fully aware of your Terms and Conditions of use. I require confirmation from you that Kickstarter have attempted direct contact with ADWGames to advise them of their obligations to fulfil the pledges or return backers funds (not that they will care). This is a requirement of my bank in order to open a chargeback claim for the money lost due to the deception........" Dear ADWGames, Kick-starter is an opportunity for persons with great ideas to develop them with the assistance of financial supporters. There is a lot of trust provided from the financial backers be it via a small or large amounts of money. Chasing down good willed backers and providing aggressive comments against backers as per the “Ice Age Mammals” kick-starter was disturbing to read and will make me think twice about supporting additional kick-starters. The allegations made could indicate that there was never an intent to deliver the project as outlined. As such, I request that an ADWGames representative and/or a kick-starter representative verify the validity of this kick-stater within 5 business days or a request will be made to amazon payments and my credit card provider to cancel the transaction made in support of this project. Regards Hey, man, I feel you. :D I am out $50 so enough to be worth trying to recover. I am more disappointed that the range of Dungeon Accessory pieces is now not going to appear, I put a lot of work into taking those from ideas to designs and hunting out illustrations for them. The matching furniture sets (intact and broken) and the monster lair set would have been great. There were also due to be Torture chamber, Mummys tomb and Workshop/Laboratory sets. luckily I didn't have much funds at the time of this one and only made a very small pledge. I got into this Kickstarter knowing the risks. I took a gamble trying to get some minis I could use. That doesn't mean I won't be trying to get my money back when this goes further south. For now, I'm sitting back and catching what unfolds. Well, kiss that $2 goodbye. Not worth the effort to reclaim it. Honestly I was surprised this even funded, back when it was dead in the water a few weeks ago. I hope the bigger pledges have more luck recouping their bets. Hmm, with Lars' insistense on communicating by phone, I tried looking up the phone number. Despite insistence on giving him a call, I couldn't find a number in the comments: <url>"paragraph" here actually added the (supporting evidence) in your request to KS? Any way I can beg for that evidence, so I don't have to spend hours filtering through these friggen comments? Thanks for any help or info...;-?

Request copied by email/message also. I don't know about regulations outside the UK but assume they are broadly similar. In the UK the regulation is covered by section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. You must claim a chargeback not more than 120 days (90 for AmEx) after making the payment direct from the card issuing bank or financial institution. You must be able to prove you have made "all reasonable efforts" to resolve the matter yourself (hence the formal refund request), this may include having to make police reports but that is down to individual CC companies. You should allow a minimum 15 days for the supplier to respond/resolve the problem unless there is obvious cause why not (death, shop closure etc) For non-delivery of goods cases there is no £minimum level covered. I would also suggest that anyone considering requesting a chargeback raise a "this is not a project" support ticket with Kickstarter (links at bottom of page) outlining the basis of the complaint against ADWGames and asking KS to attempt to contact Dina/Lars about the campaign. Ask KS to confirm to you that they have done so as this will provide further evidence of "reasonable efforts" Given the allegations made against ADWGames (with the supporting evidence provided) and the lack of response from representatives of the company, I hereby request a full refund of monies paid to ADWGames resulting from my participation in this campaign.

The transfer of money from this KS is probably what caused the rant on IAM. Yep - esp. given that KS transfers the money two weeks after funding - i.e. heutzutag. I think we have seen and heard the last of Dina, Lars, et al. This and Ice Age Mammals are obviously a scam. Blech. fair enough... @Aard Rinn - While I am in the same boat with you in losing money between these two projects, I just want to say you may want to watch you language or your posts may be reported and deleted by KS, thereby removing both your thoughts in the last post and the link. Just trying to look out for you, buddy. :) Hey, PROTIP for all you KSers out there: If someone can spread the word about you, they can also spread the word against you! So, in grand ADW Games Kickstarter spirit, I bring you: AN AARD RINN SPECIALTY SPREADSHEET! <url>… This standby of all ADW Games KS thus far (except the first one, but who cares?) is now in commentable form! Have some info that's not on here? Post a note! I'll take a look and punch it in! (not editable because vandalism) But have fun! Let's centralize this gak! (Includes handy links to earlier comments, so you can hop right to the very start of this clusterfuck!) Just thought I'd show y'all this: a real email I just got from a dude: "Hi my name is XXXXXXXXXXXX, I too was taken by these two scum bags in a different scam XX years ago. I have been after them since then. They owe me $60,000 which I will probably never see. They are in Canada illegally and the only way to get them is to physically hold on to them and call the cops! Please spread the word so no one else gets scammed by these two!" Names and dates withheld to protect those involved; less than three years, though. Well, there we go, I guess. Yeah. I woke up this morning, requested a chargeback on my card *without looking at the KS page* (I had meant to yesterday, but I was too busy), studied for my test, went to class, bombed the test, got home. Went on Reaper. Saw the threads were locked. Came here. *EVERYTHING IS ON FIRE.* I was like, god damn it. I LEAVE YOU ALONE FOR ONE DAY. It's been pretty funny watching the implosion, tho. Hope everyone pulls out okay. ...and not a peep from them on either project in 6 hours. Yeah saw that earlier....got real ugly real quick. Though I hate to stir the pot any more than it is; if you haven't looked at the Ice Age Miniatures comments page yet today, you should. <url>".........Thinking about the Monster Lair, there are very few pictures around. This one shows some of the elements necessary (although it is surprisingly clean considering Trolls live here) <url>" I am as intrigued as you to see what the end results will be. "I will be working on the monster lair and all furniture tomorrow. Your email on the former will be my guide." Lars - how about sharing this info with the rest of the backers since we don't have Rob's email and therefore have no idea of the lair design direction. Also - You've just sent a survey out which did not allow us to specify what we wanted for our pledge nor have we seen anything finished to decide - why send so early? Lars, have you decided the final list for the monster lair terrain set? Looking forward to seeing these Pics. It is 3:30 pm EST. When are they going up? There will be an update on both Kickstarters and on your website? Looking forward to seeing today's promised pictures (and those on the IAM campaign) some positive progress is the best way of answering the critics. That comes back to the questions I was asking before; about the casting/mastering process you will be using......and the request for the step by step pictures. Casteline wax is (as far as I am aware) not used by any other manufacturer in the gaming industry so am really curious to see how it works and the process used. Cool, can't wait to see pics tomorrow. Don't bother with casteline. It's a wax, not a clay - only useful for molding, not a finished product, and STEEP learning curve - it's very much a product you need to be taught to use. FIMO is easy - I'd give that a shot. Or balsa wood! @Dina - do you have to bake the castilene clay, or can you directly make a silicone mold of it? Trying to decide between trying out castilene, monster clay, or sculpey for some custom terrain stuff myself. (Granted, it'll probably look like a 5-year-old globbed together something with Play-doh, but hey...) Thanks, can't wait to see yours. ;-) Oops, here it is by it's self. <url>"x4.1/2". <url>" or slightly larger (Griffin Tamer and DF) so I think it's a good scale for a large monster. 2" x 3" ?......... Big base. That is pretty much diorama size for D&D. Sounds cool; were you still planning on posting the WIP shots to the ADW Sea Update page so we can see them, or will that happen at a later date? When can we expect some WIP photos on KS or your HP? I agree with Zach - I'll be using the minis for the same purpose (Pathfinder rather than D&D, but the same scale is used). The easier it is to place things on 1" grid-based dungeon terrain, the easier to use for gaming. :) Side note - if a tail or head sticks up in the air on a 3" long figure, and doesn't block a mini from being used on 1" of that length, that works for me for a 2" large-size creature. I am after these for rpg games too, for me the critical thing is that the furniture can be based on 1x1, 1x2 , 1x3 or 2x2. The monsters are not so much of a concern as I re-base all mine onto washers/coins anyway. As for grid or coin, I prefer a coin because it is always in the same focal plane as the figure being compared. But if other people want to go with a grid that is fine. Though I know I'm not your entire target market, I would be using them for D&D where a medium sized creature (wolves, lions, people) are on a 1" square, large creatures (horses, etc.) are on a 2x2" square, huge creatures (elephants, etc.) would be on a 3x3" square, and gargantuan creatures (orcas, etc.) would be on a 4x4" footprint. Then the scale jumps to colossal (large whales) with an 8x8" footprint. I would like my minis to fit within those scales if possible; but that's just me. Re the coin for scale: coins can be of different sizes around the world so while it would still be useful as they don't vary *that* much, something a little more objective like a ruler might be more consistent and remove risk of misunderstanding the size. 5" square on the Large sea monsters sounds reasonable - but for longer ones, stretch it out a little, and feel free to go out to 6" or 7" if it's only going to be like 2.5" wide or so. Try to keep them consistant mass-wise, IMO - a 5x5 inch mini is a LOT bigger than a 5x2 inch one. Lars: re step by step pictures: My main interest here is the dungeon pieces....incase you had not noticed ;) so I would really like to see how those are done from beginning to end. I guess the Sea Monster fans would be as eager for a full sculpt so, yes please, a step by step on a figure too. Also just commented on the last update, please stand a coin in the pictures so we can gauge the size of the pieces. @Lars - We all want the project to succeed. I feel you are taking criticism of the project on a rather personal level when it was never intended that way. Let's all take a step back, wait until the wax arrives and see the WIP shots; I hope that will alleviate discontent. :) 1. I and quite afew others understood you obviously wrong, we thought you would be leaving the comments completly. Glad to know you will be in the updates comments. You did not answer my questions though - can we expect you there frequently, and will you amswer questions in the IAM update comments? 2. thanks for the timeframe. 3. Remember that we have invested money into your campaigns. You know the amount I have pledged. Do you really think I want to loose that? Nobody in the comments has said that they want to you to fail AFAIK. What I want ar.e the high quality sculpts you have promised. Nothing more, nothing less. 1. You never clearly said that you will be visisting the update comments on AIM. You only did this here last night. Are you going to only read the update comments, or are you going to answer questions in the updates comments on IAM as well? How often do you plan to visit the IAM updates comments? To prevent further "misunderstandings" a clear answer would be greatly appreciated. 2. It is also only here after my complaints that you clearly stated that there will be weekly updates on AIM. You could call that a misunderstanding. Will there be a fixed day for the updates? As there are only 16 days left until you start delivering miniatures, there cannot be many updates left to post. 3. The unrest in main comments on AIM started after you declared leaving. You should consider that the comments, also of old projects, will be visited by prospective backers for future campaigns. Leaving them can only hurt yourselves. Also, it is common in KS that a minority is active in the comments. Some ignore the comments completly, some read them frequently without posting, some only post every now and then, and some are very active. If you think that talking to the vocal minority in the comments section is not serving the project that is your choice. From my KS experience I can only repeat, the comments section is usually observed by far more people than the ones posting there, and the interaction with backers is vital for successful campaigns. As leaving there is causing a lot of open negativity you have to decide what is best for the projects. Lars: re Casting Questions: Idle curiosity really. I worked a stint in the white metal casting room at Games Workshop and have done a fair bit of home casting since then. Just interested to know how you were making the master moulds from the soft wax sculpts and then the production moulds from the masters. If your caster can give you a process explanation that would be great, otherwise just include the master mould production and the creation of the production moulds in the step by step pictures. @ADW - As a pledger on both projects, I recall neither having been asked for nor having given an opinion on whether the comment board here or elsewhere is 'representative' of my views, interests or needs. If there has been some survey or other method of forming an objective view and I missed it, then I apologise, but if there has not, then please don't invoke 'a silent majority'. I am concerned about IAM, and more so with this strange decision to withdraw from the comment board on IAM. I remain hopeful that we will soon see some material products of substance and quality rather than what has been shown (other than in the early stages of IAM) to date. This alone is likely to ease concerns. The quotes from IAM clearly state that you wanted to stop reading and posting in the IAM comments and that there would be no updates over there. This is also from IAM comments: "We will not be monitoring the comments page moving forward." <url>#comment-7858916 This does leave little room for misunderstandings. Are you really surprised that I am not satisfied with this? As you said yourself: E il tono che fa la musica. You last comment on IAM: "Moving forward, no one from ADW will be answering this comment board." <url>#comment-7859122 On IAM you were saying completly different things. Your last comments and update there have caused a lot of unrest, and you have shown no sign of interest whilst posting happily in this comment section. Last update on IAM: "Important Notice: As of today, all future communication re: this project will be posted on <url>" <url>"Be responsive. Do your best to answer backers’ questions and address their concerns, quickly and thoroughly. It’s a great way of showing people that you’re reliable, available, and committed to your project." (Taken from KS). Moving away from KS is not alright at all and against KS policy. Yeah, I thought RTV (Room Temperature Vulcanizing) Silicon Rubber would be about your only choice unless you wanted to play with the multiple layers of latex and mat. You will have to ask your casting guy to drop by here to chat about the moulding process (and post up the step by step images you promised before). I have used RTV silicon for white metal and resin casting and it is pretty straightforward if you have a decent vibro table. Are you aiming to use RTV silicon for the production moulds as well as the masters then? Lars: If you have now decided to master all the furniture by hand what is being done by the 3D/CAD guy who did the great looking Dresser blank? Once you have the Castiline sculpts are you using plaster moulds (lost wax technique) or RTV silicon to produce casting masters? Castiline wax seems to have a melting point very close to the vulcanising point of the silicon rubber used for spin casting moulds. Are you going to stopp commenting here too, like in IAM? This is an exteemly bad, dodgy move. I want a refund for both KS. I will file a complaint with KS and Amazon if you do not reply to my mail and refund me ASAP. So is the Update page going to be up today? Lars, just sent you a message with some descriptions and a couple of pictures about the monster lairs. Whoops- 'things' not thinks and only one 'W'w on comment before...me dum dumb. Gotta run, it was a good day. Glad to see thinks are moving along with more interaction again. Remember, I'm being totaly superficial here, but I'm looking for a great finished product. I'm not worried about the little things like proccess, materials or being a bit late. "Let's do it ..." :-) Post ADW Comment - Cool, maybe another for the IAM KS too? :-) Good idea, pictures in the comments. Wwith links to pictures, if people want to go look, they can. You have a web site, maybe dedicate some tempoary space for pictures you can link here. when enough are ready, send out an update with pictures and bag the old links once they have been added to an update. Or reuse the space for a new group of pictures until the next update and so on... I would vote for not posting any updates with early sculpts, but instead simply post them in the comments so people who want to look at them can and the others can simply ignore them. Interesting, in these comments it is "Raw is good, the whole process", in the comments for the update it is all "Details only!" I agree with David Weir, maybe even a few action shots or even sculpting, molding and casting videos. No need for added fancy graphics or color filters, just raw and wriggling...slurp, slurp. I am interested in the whole process. Raw is good. A "Lot-Lot-Lot". If you get the reference, you might just watch the comedy channel. ;-) Bases or not? Here are a few mushrooms I've done recently. You will notice little round rock piles next to the tall Mushrooms for added stability and on the small white clusters I made a base to look like stone or could be a dirt pile if painted that way. Most of the bigger shrooms have no base, just a wide enough stem or multiple mushrooms for better stability. Just for scale, the cluster of three in the small purple/pink/ w/ red buttons are about 1" cubed. The large round lily pads are between 3/4" to an inch. <url>" grids! I predict that there are going to be 134 very excited people in about 2-3 months time. And some very loyal customers to one of the greatest mini sculpting teams in the business. Lars/Dina: Congratulations on the success of the project. Not the easiest of roads but a great result in the end. I am looking forward to seeing all the ideas and concepts begin to take shape. Going to be a fun couple of months. Yeah. You may want to finish the sculpts of your first couple of KS projects first. I wouldn't say you have to ship them...but having final pictures will go a long way. Likewise...it could be nice to have a bunch of carnival KS images ready to go at launch. Sign me up!! Depends on the oven timer. Congratulations Dina and Lars - You guys knocked it out of the park this time. @ David Weir - Wouldn't it be Buzzzzzzzzzz, BROWNIES ARE DONE? Having dropped out due to lack of communication I find myself agreeing wholeheartedly with Galit, you really turned it round. I'm back in and will be adding more during the PM. Congratulations!!! @David - caps were made to announce brownies Carnival???????? SIgn me up!! (assuming, of course, you're making a creepy carnival) Sorry about the CAPS ding! bROWNIES ARE DONE! Congratulations Dina and Lars!! You really did a 180 turnaround with this campaign and it paid off BIG TIME!!! Great job!!! \o/ Oooh, brownies like out of the Willow movie I hope. I'm getting double walls, double small sea monsters, double monster lair, triple mushrooms, triple furniture, double stalagmites/shrooms, and double something else I think. @RMK what are friends for?! ;-) Right now Lars is regretting the choice of putting a batch of brownies in the oven this morning, instead of the final molds. @Galit - Yeah, we have a habit of doing that to each other. lol Thanks for the idea of a third account. :) @Jared your comment just made me snort-laugh =p @RMK Nope, you brought me here from another campaign. =) @Lars - 11 minutes. How fast can you sculpt? So just to confirm. You will be able to upgrade your pledge with Add ons and multiples of what you have already pledged for till the end of Sept? I would have like to have pledged for the Walls/monster lair but without anything concrete i can't. If however the sculpts appear and look good I would like to increase my pledge and add them. Hey Galit. Did you back IAM? I can't remember if you did. @Lars, Dina, ADW Games, et.al. Congratulations on surviving a tough, drama filled campaign. I look forward to figuring out how to paint and what to do with these great figures. Will the post-KS survey have a way to tell you what extras we might have pledged for,(IAM did not)? The only thing I'm not getting doubles of, is the $30 sea monsters pledge ... since we don't do ocean campaigns, I think I'm safe with just having singles of them (and two polypus add-ons .. those just look awesome!) HAH! Hiya Realm Master K! I just finished upping my third account pledge.... I thought what the heck, let me just have doubles of the walls, monster lair terrain AND mushrooms and furniture! Galit!! What up homie?! I pledged on a third account.... gotta have extra mushrooms and furniture! @Lars & Dina - Will the Turtes be available as an Epic sized Add on? Lars, running a Kickstarter is basically a full-time job, from what I gather from other projects. Also, turtles... Snapping turtles :D Turtles... I added two more Epic Sculpts to my pledge. Can't miss out on the Turtles!! I just added $15, so we just need another. Getting very close to that $4500 goal... I sure hope we get some turtles :) Although this wasn't the smoothest Kickstarter I backed, the unique style makes we really want to get these miniatures. That is one of the things I like best about you guys. You really listen to your backers and adjust according to suggestions. When I mentioned broken furniture, you jumped right on it. That was Awesome in so many ways I can't do it justice in words. No one has ever done broken furniture, at least none that I have ever seen. I look forward to having my players see all of the crazy cool things that you are making for us. I have been running an Epic campaign for over 15 years and they are fast approaching an Ice Age/Prehistoric Lost World that they know nothing about so your IAM campaign was perfectly timed for me. And they also have a sailing ship so the Sea Monsters, especially some of the Epics will be a great addition to my campaign. I can hardly wait. I'll see how some of the sculpts turn out and potentially add some latter on. I suppose shipping doesn't increase by adding add-ons? @Dina & Lars - Sweet. Thank you for the clarification. In case I can't stick around for the finale, I just wanted to let you both know that I am super excited for all of your efforts in making these awesome minis and terrain available for us. Wanted to make sure you knew that before this campaign reaches its final conclusion. Thanks, that's what I needed to know. @Dina & Lars - If you are an IAM Backer, and you pledge for the $30 small monsters level wouldn't you also get the special IAM freebies? My main question is: I pledged for the "$30 small monsters" level, what exactly does this get me? The"$30 mushroom" level is fully explained, but the same is not true for the other $30 levels. Lars, the KS is almost finished, could we get an update on the open questions before it ends? I noticed that you added the size chart to the front page, thanks for that. Judging from that and the sizes given, even the "small"/giant monsters would be at least "large"in D&D terminology (>=2"x2" base). The perfect size for a regular monster battle. The epic size would be exactly that: an epic battle against a single powerful map-filling enemy. The original list for the monster lair developed after the BoG project, I requested swapping the 2 bits of Giant funtiture to something more apropriate to Orcs or Trolls. Back in the comments I linked to a picture I found on the web of the Troll Cave from the Hobbit that shows the sort of pieces I had in mind for the set. The thorn and ice walls were specifically why I pledged for the BoG and this project. The water and bone walls were also interesting ideas, too. Thanks Lars! That's Awesome!! I use a scale of 1" = 3 feet (1 meter) so a 3" Wall is just about perfect for a 10 foot wide wall. Thank you. So the monster lair is a different set of miniatures that will be created after the kickstarter is over? Hey Lars - still need to confirm... the furniture (whole and Broken) is not the same as the monster lair furniture 'Set 3: Monster Lair- part of $75 pledge or $15 as an add on. 10 human Bones, Crude Bedding, 5 bags of Coins, 1 Old Fire Pit, 4 Misc Tools for Chopping, 1 Giant Crude Cupboard, 1 Giant Chest' @Lars & Dina - Are there going to be two sizes of Walls? I see concept art for both 2" and 3" walls on the front page. Very interested in the 3" designs. Please let me know. You could be right about the original 39. Seems so long ago now. lol Lookee, now we have 118 backers. @Realm: I am not sure there, perhaps this one is best for Dina to answer. There was a confirmation in one of her first comments that the original backers here (39 at that time) would get the furniture/monster/mushrooms pledge even if this KS did not fund. The IAM legacy was mentioned first on that campaign. I was under the impression that held for the 39 even though the campaign has now funded. @SableFox: You pay for the shipping. so minimum is $12. So, as an international backer, is that $2 (the minimum qualifying pledge), $12 (the minimum pledge plus $10 shipping) or just $10 shipping since that is > $2. @RMK - Thanks for the clarification, all. I've bumped my $1 to $2, and I'll keep checking this project and IAM. I'm really hoping to see some sculpts once the wax comes in, maybe even walls...? That would convince me to up my pledge, given Lars willingness to accept increased pledges this month while they are sculpting. @Robh & Sable Fox - Only IAM backers have the >$1 Legacy Pledge for the Freebies. New backers get the same deal for $15 since they had not backed the Ice Age Mammals campaign. The special price was for a loyalty gift for backing both campaigns. @AR: Also, Lars said a couple of days back that he would replace the Giant Furniture in the Lairs set with more appropriate Sacks and/ or Chests of "stolen and scavenged stuff", treasure piles and looted armour pieces etc. @Sable Fox: My understanding of the legacy pledge was that as either a backer of IAM or an original backer here you get the $15 pledge for $1, not once for each. There was some text about it but I cannot find it now, may have got lost in the pre 48 hour redesign. So (I believe) you do not need to pledge the $15 as well as the $1, just add for whatever else you want. @AR: You have missed the Intact and Broken Furniture sets from your spreadsheet. $1/$15 pledge gets 1 of each of the 10 intact and 1 of each of the 10 broken. $30 gets 10 pieces Intact (pick & mix) and 10 pieces Broken (pick & mix) Dresser, Table/Chairs, 4 Poster Bed, Sideboard, Armchair, Low Table, Wardrobe, Settle, Barrels/Crates, Throne @Aard - This is what Dina & Lars said about the $15 pledge level in a comment earlier. Does this answer your question? “There is an offer for Ice Age Mammal Pledgers that is in effect, yes. New Pledges get the same deal for $15+shipping. Customer Loyalty Offering, really. We will do the same thing after we deliver and start our pre-Holiday KS. Sep 8 2014 on Miniature Sea Monsters, Dungeon Furniture and Big Beasts. I thought it might have been. Looking forward to seeing all of the sculpts. Will we be able to add on the Big Beasts at the same add on cost during pledge manager phase once we see the final sculpts? Hey, Dina/Lars, can you clarify the 15/2 pledge levels? Aard_Rinn, from what I gathered (mainly the details on the front page for the $15 and $30 mushroom levels and the comments made by Lars), the only difference between IAM and non-IAM backers is IAM backers get the $15 pledge for $2. At least for the $15 and the $30 mushroom levels, the front page lists without any disclaimers that the rewards in () are included for everyone. Lars and Dina - I just ran across a page of Sea Monsters that is pretty cool. It has a lot of the images you have on the front page. But there are also a bunch of other really cool looking monsters. I thought you might want to see it. (if you haven't already) <url>#gid=0 Since we've had an influx of non-IAM backers, I put IAM rewards in () Aard_Rinn, could you update your spreadsheet with the latest information from Lars? 2. Big sea monsters are $15 each, or $200 for all ten? Isn't the $200 for 10 a worse deal? $200 gets ten Epic size and 10 giant/smaller size. 7. How much is the Monster Lair set as an add-on? $15 8. Can the stretch goal "free items" be purchased as add-ons if we want multiples? yes $10 each @Dennis - thanks for the info. I will stick with £2, I know where I am with £2 (roughly $3 ;-) @SableFox: The currency sign always goes before the amount, so $2, €2, £2, etc. It's only when written as 2 USD, 2 EUR, etc. that the currency goes after the amount. After this brief intermission, back to your scheduled kickstarter... Thanks Lars - just to confirm... the furniture (whole and Broken) is not the same as the monster lair furniture 'Set 3: Monster Lair- 10 human Bones, Crude Bedding, 5 bags of Coins, 1 Old Fire Pit, 4 Misc Tools for Chopping, 1 Giant Crude Cupboard, 1 Giant Chest' And one other thing that "bothers" me, is it $2 or 2$??? I always thought it was $2, but lots of people are writing 2$ here. Or is that just from 2€ usage? So Aard_Rinn, since you seem to be the authority around here :-) if I am a IAM backer, one of the original backers of this project (before it went pear shaped) and on $15 pledge. Do I get three sets of the below, or just one? ;-) Is there any point me pledging $15 or would I be wise to be pledging just $2? Despite having been on this KS since its inception, I do not know what I am getting. Yee Haw!!! That's what I wanted to hear. Stokage now ensues!!! 'I needs to know?' Wow... I speaks good English! LOL! Hey Lars - I know you're busy but I needs to know if there is going to be anything tangible sculpted for the walls and monster lair. It's difficult to pledge for something without anything to go by other than a few wall sketches from the ICE kickstarter. Thanks. Hey Lars - If we back at the $30 Giant Sea Monster level will we be able to choose which of the 10 sculpts we want? ie, if we want 2 of one and none of another will that be possible? Kind of a mix and match system. IAM backers get the freebies and whatever they pledged for, yes. That is (I believe) 1 of the core monsters, a set of mushrooms, and some furniture (whole and broken). Still no reply to Mail or PM. I will be off the Internet for the Rest of the campaign, so no chance of increasing my pledge. I wanted to know - if I can increase the pledge post KS when sculpts are shown - do I get the freebies as a 2$ IAM backer. We hit $4000last night and immediately lost $300. Let's hope it sticks this time. And that puts us over the top with my pledge on my second account. :) Just to repeat my query from yesterday: As an IAM backer, if I pledge $2 plus postage what exactly do I get? Thanks And here *I* was thinking I didn't have much use for maggots. :) Lars: Will you allow us to swap stretch goal free figures? Being a land lubber I have no use for the Crabs, Kelpie or Snapper Turtles but would prefer to take more bases of the Maggots and Water Bug (who will make a great Dungeon Critter) That format would be ideal, but an exhaustive list (minus stretch goals) would work too if you're short on time. Lars, could you please update the front page with the details of the pledge levels, as was requested by several backers? I'm making assumptions about what I will be receiving and I would hate to find out when I receive my package that I should have added additional stuff. Re: money back guarantee: KS doesn't enforce this guarantee, so we have to take your word for it. I'm not saying that you aren't trustworthy, just that we have no way to verify you are. All of us backing this project are taking a gamble and hoping we were right to trust you. We only have past accomplishments to go on, which means the ice age minis KS. Lars. I am glad to see that you are confident in the project. However, there is a difference between being confident and being - shall we say - aggressive. I will provide examples. When someone says "I have concerns you won't be able to deliver a product." The reassuring answer is: "We know things have been bad, but we are going to try our best to get you a quality product in a timely fashion. We have a much better team now and we are confident that we can meet our goals. However, we understand your concern, which is why we created the 15 dollar tier - a lost cost option for those who have the kinds of concerns you expressed." See how that answer (which is basically what Dina was saying several days ago) acknowledges the concerns of your customers while reassuring them that you will do your best to address those concerns? On the other hand, you seem to be dismissing customer concerns with responses like "that won't happen" or treating concerns as attacks or harassment. Yes, Olog was trolling - but the links he provided contained legitimate concerns that many of us share. Maybe I am misreading you. However, I think that is more an issue of the way you are making your statements than some failure of my reading. And it seems that others feel the same - since your comments, we have lost at least four backers - and that's only since I got here two hours ago. Your posts these past four hours sound angry. It is never wise to attempt PR while you are upset. My suggestion is to go work on some sculpts or have a sandwich or something. Cool off. Maybe have Dina handle the comments for a while. Oh, and whatever has happened in your e-mails is a separate issue. I haven't read your e-mails, so I don't know what went on there. All I know is what was posted here in the thread. I'm not talking about PT employees or the previous Kickstarter. I am talking about your comments, written today, in the past 3-4 hours. Customers lacking confidence in your company (which, for the purpose of making miniatures, is not 9 years old, but only just starting up) is not harassment. Please do not compare customers questioning your ability to deliver a product that you have never before delivered to actual harassment. Lars - I think you might want to check your attitude. Your company offered free miniatures, even if the KS failed, because the company had so severely harmed customer confidence. Your company did this as an apology, and in an attempt to make the deal so good that even those who were suspicious would take a risk, gamble 15 bucks, and see what happened. That's what we're doing - gambling. All of us here hope that you will succeed and deliver great miniatures - but we don't know that for sure. When people like Olog troll post (after all, Olog had to back the project to post), it is annoying, but the links he presented do present real concerns of real people (including backers who have pledged to this campaign). Meanwhile, when you attack people for not having confidence in your company - when your company, just three days ago, was forced into buying back customer loyalty - it doesn't make you come off as less suspicious. It makes you come off as more suspicious and trying to censor your critics. Olog's comments rolled right off my back because I already thought about that and decided 15 dollars was worth the risk. Your comments in the past two hours made me reconsider my pledge. I have not changed my pledge, but only because I believe that ADW Games deserves a chance. I suggest you think about your attitude before myself - and others - rethink that position. Thank you for the responses, Dina and Lars -- I'm going to respectfully remove my pledge, but I have bookmarked your website and I honestly look forward to seeing your product line grow in the future. I may be kicking myself later when I'm purchasing your miniatures for retail, but at least you will be receiving a fair profit at that point (and I do like companies I support to receive a profit from me as a customer). Good luck to you, and thanks again! I think a good example of what people are wanting is regards to quality are the 2 terror birds on IAM. They convinced me to pledge. The WIP sculpts were good in the beginning, but seemed to get worse (The 2nd sloth looked like Alf...). As always, quality is what matters. Quality in both product and service. Reaper just pushed back their Bones 2 kickstarter delivery due to the same quality issue. I think the whole trust issue stems from ADW trying to move too quickly without having solid sculpts at project launch and completed delivery the prior kickstarter to build trust with customers. Several IAM backers have stated on message boards they have not and will not pledge for another ADW kickstarter until product has been delivered so they can see it and feel it. They WANT to be fans of the product and want to fund projects like this, but they just want to have the first kickstarter delivered before they pledge more money. The "bashing" on the forums were from backers and they (including me) were complaining about the very same WIP sculpts that you rejected. Very disappointed by the us vs them attitude. I would like to point out that all of the discussion on the Dwarven Forge thread (haven't read the others) is from the forum members (and some of them, including me, are backers here) and NOT from the company. Lars, the gaming industry, as far as I have seen, is actually very welcoming. The concerns people have are the same they have had since IAM: lack of finished pieces. We appreciate you working the extra hours to get the sculpts done. People just want to see what they're funding. I am frankly astonished that people are backing this project, and that it looks like it will reach it's funding goal. I hate to be that person, but there are many warning signs and inconsistencies concerning this company, which have been discussed at length in various forums. Everyone is of course free to do what they want, but I would advice backers here to do some research before parting with their money. Some of these threads are long, with concerns mostly voiced towards the end. Good luck. <url>"free items" be purchased as add-ons if we want multiples? 9. Update #2 lists additional free items -- a set of mushroom terrain and a big or small scale monster. Are these in addition to everything else listed as a free stretch item? 10. Could you post a clear list of everything that comes with each pledge level and add-on, and the pledge price? I'd love to increase my pledge now (before the end of the Kickstarter) but I'm really not entirely sure how much to increase it by... So Lars, if I change my pledge to $2 plus shipping from its current $15 plus shipping, I still get the furniture (whole & broken), fungus and stretch goals? (Yes, I am an IAM backer) LArs: re SeaLion. It is a great looking concept..... now, the original 1980s look was decidedly un-impressive: <url>"legacy pledge" where it was stated anything >$1 would get stretch goals, is that still the case? I want to verify before the KS is over. Thanks Aard! I've updated the Pledge List with all of the new stretch goals: <url>#gid=0 I had suggested this in update #13. But what about a nice world turtle (or Aspidochelone)? @Brian: This spreadsheet, made by Aard_Rinn, may be helpful, although it's not up to date with the latest changes: <url>#gid=0 Everyone >$1 gets the stretch items. Stalagmites are definitely included in the $30 mushroom and higher, and potentially in the other $30 pledges too (waiting for confirmation from Lars). Otherwise, they can be added as a $10 add-on. @Aard - Maybe Narwhal have wings? Yes SeaLion....D&D style: <url>"IIRC" means, but ok, so add on for the Leviathan and then the that's all 10. Cool, thanks. Galit: IIRC the $30 does not get the Leviathan. Yep, the front page is looking good! I'm curious though... because the page lists 10 sea monsters, but the $30 sea monster pledge says only 9. Does that mean if someone wants all 10, they have to add on for a giant one? (I'm assuming it would be the Giant size... because even though the pledge description says 'small', the main page only says Giant or Epic) I think this piece of text needs to come out, or the FAQ needs to be written! ..........The exact method of casting is discussed in the FAQ section, and links are provided for anyone interested in the details of the casting methods being used........ More importantly need the prices for the Dungeon Furniture and Monster Lair sets (or individual pieces), the Mushrooms, the Spell Walls and extra copies of the Stretch Goal Slugs and Maggots added to the "add ons" list. It is looking a lot better now though. I spotted a typo on the front page: "Hello and welcome to ADW GAMES Sea Monsters, Terrain and Big ***east Kickstarter. " Wow- I check in after five days, and Lars has steered this left-for-dead project through funding and even stretch goals. It looks like there are some good thematic ideas going and a great deal for $15 pledges. But I'm bowing out of this KS, and as a fairly enthusiastic backer of your 3 KS projects, I wanted to mention why. I appreciate the effort put out by Lars and team to rescue this KS, but I just haven't seen anything happen on the Ice Age Mammals KS. I fully expected this KS to not be funded, just as the Band of Gnomes KS was cancelled, and that would have been great, because ADW Games could focus on building their reputation with their first KickStarter. But for whatever reason, you launched another KS after cancelling Band of Gnomes KS before moving forward on the Ice Age Mammals, which is a great concept. It's almost like you didn't learn from the cancelled BoG KS. I pledged both that KS and this one for the cool terrain wall ideas and sketches, and I'd still love to have them, but it's just too stressful wondering how thin you're stretched with the first KS still out there. I hope I'm wrong and you've sorted everything, in which case I'll be very happy if some Terror Birds and Cave Lions arrive in the mail. Good luck! Oh, and we blew past the last stretch goal. Can't wait for what's to follow :D Welcome to all new backers! Hmm, the current front page makes it seems as if there is only one $30 level. The porcine whale scult looks nice. I like the style much better than the reference image. BTW, I would remove the WIP image of the "Giant Gomphotherium" since it doesn't I hope/assume) represent final work. For someone who doesn't know how sculpting works (like me), it looks pretty bad. Also, I'm still waiting for the size chart :). Mostly since it's still not exactly clear that small=giant and big beast=sea monster=big sea monster=epic (I hope I got that right). Thanks Lars! I can't wait to see them! =) I have just caught up with everything as its a workday here & I just got home @Aard - great advice given - I would not contradict anything you said & actually want to further emphasise it. updating your home page here on KS I find is essential to ending your KS (& running it properly in the first place as some KS are badly organised & it puts people off)- 1) clear up what each pledge level gets now -this makes it easier to understand 2) tidy up any photos or pictures as you can - good sculpts & art with a combo of both is preferable & presents more professionally 3) make sure what you can get as add-ons are clearly listed such as IAMs that you will make available eg. sabertooths - people are likely to pledge for addons if they can figure out what is available & how much 4) the freebies for pledging are kept & any updates listed for them 5) make sure you have an extra stretch goal ready or 2 in case people decide to back that weren't going to or helps current backers to increase their pledge level/amount regards David If you want to stay with the mushroom theme, mushroom corals should be easy to sculpt but not as menacing as a brain coral. Like spider crabs! <3! Some ideas: <url>" and 3" long, will any of the sizes of sea monsters from the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum images be about that size too? Lars: are the Sea Monsters complete fully rounded sculpts or "waterline" flat base? Dina, re walls: Sorry, do you mean $7 before KS ends and $12 on Pledge manager OR $12 RRP This might have already been suggested. What about simple shark fins with a little sea foam/water ripple around them. You pop a few right onto a piece of lake/river/moat terrain, and it's suddenly shark-infested. You could do different sizes. Or maybe some sort of fantasy shark fin. Seems to me like these could be simple and widely useful in a variety of situations. Good evening all (from my perspective :-)) Probably already posted somewhere but could you let me know how much each wall would be as a an add-on. Thank you in advance. Those five would be an amazing start, yes. It's okay if a few details are left off - just focus on polished models, and them mention that they have yet to see final detailing. Furniture would in addition to a mostly-finished sculpt seems like a good idea to me since it would showcase what we can expect for the different types. It terms of time; I think a load of unfinished sculpts might do more harm than good. I would concentrate on detailing the figures (including links to inspirational/source art if you need something visual) and getting your information on each pledge level as clear as possible. If you want to sculpt, then I would say doing one figure well would be the best bet. I'd go for the small leviathan, and the size chart. It's a sunday, so I can do up a pledge chart for you if you want, or toss around some updates to formatting on the Docs chart... I'd say if you can use the next twenty hours or so to get one or two finished pieces done, that'd be perfect. A few more blocked out and at least taken past the fimo stage would also be good, as an update - try to limit the unfinished minis on the front page to only those near completion - and I'd skip any blocks that are only foil - they aren't really that interesting or impressive, visually, and they don't tell people anything useful about the process. I would also suggest any size reference information (small vs giant vs epic) as well as any add ons that you have. That will help motivate backers and increase pledges. Any sculpts that are done or preliminary would be best. I am ok with a bit of absence for you to get that in order. I know a lot of us backed IAM because of the great prelim sculpts... especially sculpt pics. Concept art is well and good, but sculpts are what people put money in for! Yes please =) Say, is this the same Dina Andrews: <url>"Small versions of 9 sea monsters" pledge also includes a larger monster as per update #2, or was that only if the project didn't fund? I'm a bit uncertain as to the sizes of the monsters due to the different names being used. Would it be possible to make an image showing a comparison of the small, large, epic, ... sizes? The strech goal images are a great example of what I'm looking for. Weekends are generally slower on Kickstarter, I guess most people have family tasks/needs that take preference. Thankfully here it is early evening so those are done with for a while! Next event of note is the 48 hour reminder email that KS sends out to anyone who has put the project on their watch list. They will see the email, look back at the project and decide then whether to back or not. That is the time you will need to have the frontpage up to date with all the necessary pictures etc and a clear guide on what each pledge contains. I think it is great that you and Dina have been able to turn this project around. Leeches, along with various forms and sizes of centipedes, ants, beetles, ticks, spiders, rats, worms and snakes are common in D&D gaming and are pretty well covered by various manufactures. But, more options on those types of things would always be welcome....and Maggots! For aquatic D&D there are not a lot of options as water themed standard D&D games are pretty rare but (along with normal and giant versions of common marine creatures) some notable creatures do exist: Chuul, which is like a giant beetle/sand flea cross with the front pair of arms replaced with lobster type claws. Water Mephit, classic Lovecraftian "deep one" look, short, squat humanoid form but fish features with large bulbous eyes and scaly skin. Locathha, A man sized, human form creature with transverse crested fish head, fins along the length of its arms and legs and webbed hands and feet (no tail). Skum: Similar to Locatha but smaller, evil looking and stooped/deformed. Merfolk: (male and female) Sea Devil (Sahuagin): also similar to the Locatha but has features more like a lizard/fish cross than human, walks upright, has tail. Tojanida: A form of giant turtle with snapping jaws, 2 dragon type arms with claws and 4 paddle legs. Sea Lion: Large (12ft long) creature with head, shoulders and front legs of a lion with the body and tail of a fish. The Lion bits are all covered in scales and the lion paws are webbed. A thin patchy version of a lion mane forms around the back of the head and shoulders and down the spine to the tail. Triton: Form of Merfolk but has 2 finned legs rather than a single fish tail. Not sure which of these names may be WotC copyright now. Maybe worth considering if you want stretch goals that work for both Marine and Dungeon aspects of this KS....but I am not sure of the potential ongoing market for anything other than the Skum and Mephit figures as degenerate Cthulhu fish men are popular in many different games. Although I would love to see a model of the Chuul with shorter stocky beetle legs than the plastic D&D miniatures figure. Oh, the castaline still hasn't arrived? Any idea when it's inbound? Well, you know I'm behind horses, absolutely, so the Tangie seems like a super-fun stretch goal! And the HISM is more than a bit awesome - kind of Groot-esque, IYKWIM, so! I love twiggy forest monsters and such... Any chance of some shots of the progress on the IAM minis? Also... FIVE DOLLARS. SO CLOSE. Giant Slug stretch goal looks good for Dungeon gaming, I would still really like to see some smaller Maggot type things though. Maybe rather than individuals, 2 or 3 sculpted together as a squirming pile sized to fit on 1" base. Thinking about the Monster Lair, there are very few pictures around. This one shows some of the elements necessary (although it is surprisingly clean considering Trolls live here) <url>"EU-friendly" shipping. I'm having some trouble understanding what exactly is included in each pledge level (AR's spreadsheet helps, but I still have some doubts). A detailed "offical" list in an update or on the main page would be helpful for new backers. If I understand correctly, everything that is included in the $15 pledge expect the furniture is also included in the $30 levels? So if I pledge for the "small version of 9 monsters", I'd also get the mushrooms and the extra epic monster as per update #2? So, if anyone wants to see the sort of resurgence we've had, look here: <url>#chart-daily We did as well today as we did in the first three days, and I'm sure we'll only do better as time goes by! I sent an email to my friends who I have asked to pass on as well - we are linked through a lot of gamers - hope it helps Sent out another tweet! Let's keep pushing! \o/ And wow - almost to 3k! Can we do 5k? I think so! KK - sent! A eurypterid would be very cool too :-) BTW, Lars, I sent you a PM - I'm not sure if it lets you know when one is sent, so I just thought I'd mention it... would it be a one for one rate? pay extra? or get say two for one? so are we now able to get ice age mammals like the sabertooth tiger? if yes can these be taken instead of sea monsters ? How about a nice Polypus? <url>#gid=0 Hey, Lars, send me a PM if I've left anything off, KK? Ooo, another "smaller" sea creature idea: <url>#facrc=_&imgdii=_&imgrc=S5Wo3NsncPlJlM%253A%3B0L9uWKcVOcohOM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.taipeitimes.com%252Fimages%252F2012%252F02%252F14%252FP02-120214-2.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.taipeitimes.com%252FNews%252Ftaiwan%252Farchives%252F2012%252F02%252F14%252F2003525453%3B480%3B318 they're all gorgeous. Also, thanks for the size info! Updating it now! I like the way this is rebuilding the enthusiasm it had at the beginning. I have increased my pledge again to include the mushroom pledge level too. If you are still looking for the 2nd stretch goal, how about a generic maggot/slug type thing for Dungeon gaming. Only small, about 3/4 inch long by 1/2 inch wide. No discernible facial features but a flat head possibly with small pincers: <url>"giant" marine creatures, but not so huge that it won't be usable several times - say, as a servant of merpeople, or the sea-god's personal steed. And it would look damn fine on a shelf! Actually, 10" is fine. Darklands stuff is BIG! Oh, will do! Thanks Lars! I just sent out a tweet, hopefully it'll bring in a few more backers! @all if you're on Twitter, please retweet! or tweet a message of your own! <url>"human" form? OSL eyes, maybe? If bigger minis are better, I remember seeing a documentary think on the shark god Dakuwaqa. Basically he is a huge (collosal?) shark that protects one of the islands. He can take any form but is most often encountered on land as a man with the upper torso of a shark... so basically a wereshark I guess... I don't know how you could convey Shark god vs just big shark though... Maybe give him some other features like spikes or horns... Or make him like the movie "Sharktapus" and give him tentacles. Like this... <url>"you can't take it with you". What's important is who we share our lives with, the memories we create and the values we instill in our children. It's who we are as a person that defines us, not the 'stuff'. That being said .... you have me seriously considering pledging on another account for that $30 sea monster level. so I pledged $55 - for the elemental walls level plus the $15 level plus shipping OS hope you get funded @Spade - I'm nearly a generation even further back, but everything you wrote applies. @ADW - Lars? That most recent post below did more to restore my confidence than all before and the offers. I love ice age mammalia. I live near the peabody museum in New Haven, and they have an irish elk skeleton there... it always used to be my favorite thing, that and the rhea. I have many fond memories of going there to look at the fossils with my father. @Lars: I am in my mid thirties, and I also had an Ice Age elephant book when I was about 5. I wore the pages out of it. Dragons were cool, elephants were neat, but that book was what first connected my so-tiny-yet-so-big mind between real and fantasy, and how wonderful the area between them can be. Those images are exactly why I looked at IAM. The artwork and models in IAM reflects my memories of that book so vividly. It silly, but I'm glad someone with those same (or similar) images is handling the models at ADW, seeing as I am hoping to use the minis to share my memories and maybe a bit of wonder with my own kids. Keep it up, and thank you. $15 plus $10 postage? Ok I'm in. Good luck! I for one am keeping my $75 Mushrooms, Walls, and Monster Terrain pledge. I really hope this funds. I am so very glad that you are still moving forward with all of the great ideas. I am thinking of sending out a new update to the Kickstarter Awesome List letting our 1100 members know about the changes and improvements to the campaign. Should help you reach funding. Well I have to say you all have gone a long way over the last couple of days to restore faith. I had downgraded to a $1 pledge but re-upped to the same $30 mushroom pledge and now the new $15 level is pretty enticing, so I dropped down to that pledge level.... but kept my $30 pledge. Nice job communicating again and I sincerely hope you get funded! Hmmm, $25 for a Big and a Bonus Big, or $30 for all the smalls and a bonus big... So many tough choices. If the KS fails to fund are you only sending the freebies (furniture and mushrooms) or will you be sending whatever the person pledge for? Not that I think it makes any difference, since I suspect this will fund ;-) For the $15 pledge, can we swap the sea monster for a Big Beast? Okay, so just to be clear, according to previous posts and the front page: Even if this KS doesn't fund (which means we, the 39 current backers, won't be charged any money) you will still be making the miniatures, sending out surveys, and shipping rewards? I only ask because that's kind of mind-blowing. I mean, that would certainly build some customer loyalty, but it also sounds like you would be taking a pretty major loss. If I've gotten something wrong, let me know. O_O Srsly? And you guys are totes my homies. Just let me know whenever you need a hand - I'm always happy to help out a friend! Just let me know if there are other things that need changing. I left the furniture bit vague until we have a list of items it's going to contain... Your loyal chartmaker has updated the chart a wee wot, eh? <url>#gid=0 It's just most likely that a lot of the sculpts will not be ready before the end of the kickstarter? I won't lie and say there isn't a definite level of lingering apprehension and suspicion after everything that has happened. As some have stated it's all about trust. That being said, everyone deserves a second chance. Please prove us right in trusting... Back in for the $75 pledge! @Lars - I'm a little unsure what the end goals are now. I was originally Pledging for the mushrooms, Spell walls and monster lair terrain ($75). Are you still trying to produce those and the 10 sea monsters? still hoping this'll fund. I agree. Photos would move me more, no harm intended I would like to see at least some of the finished monster sculpts before this ends, then... even some pictures would be a huge +. On the subject of cancellation alone:- I think it is fair enough to say, at this point, that there will not be finished sculpts so we will have to trust ADW Games to deliver. Those who don't want to take a risk have 6 days to cancel for themselves. Those who are willing to stay with the project then have a clear idea of the risk they are taking. And, like I said, I'm always happy to help - just let me know what you need. by presenting a concerted, positive customer service approach and a plan that shows skill and organization in your fulfillment. Much as I hate to say it, if you can't show us the sculpts by the end of this, you should cancel the project, as promised. Take a month or two. Get your IAM sculpts finished & figures sent. Finish the Core Figures for this KS - if you want to keep posting them here to get input, that's great! And then, come November or so, give us a finished KS. Give us complete sculpts, not hints at what could be. Give us your plan, and let people who've seen your resin from the first KS testify to it's quality. These poorly-run KS do nothing to build confidence in you as a company, and only hurt our trust in your ability to fulfill - and falling off of the radar for over a week is something that _never_ should have happened. You have my contact info, if you want to get in touch. But please, slow down, take some time to prove yourself and get your feet under you, and then start your next project. It's amazing how much people will forgive once people have resin in hand - but free gifts are just promises as ephemeral as the mini's themselves until you've proven those minis exist, and a remarkably expensive way to build goodwill that could be gained as easily @Creator - Will we still be able to see all the sculps before the project finishes? I am real happy about the last 2 updates. And I am doubly happy that the project is going to continue and be expanded. Very much looking forward to seeing the final sculpts for this campaign and Ice Age Mammals. (I'm scheduled to get a bunch of them) :) Yeah, I'm not optimistic about this one. I will consider backing a new project - and here's the key part - AFTER IAM arrives, but at this point I want to see resin in hands before I give more money. Lars has posted an update. An interesting read. Well, if we're talking about this project in the past tense, here's the post-mortem: <url>#chart-daily This KS project was halfway funded on Day 3, which is a good sign for funding even with the concerns about Ice Age Mammals sculpts. Day 3 is also when the daily backer comments peaked (59). After that funding, comments, and backers came to a dead stop, but not the usual doldrums until the 48-hour fence-sitters return to a project. We had almost NO comments, and a slow bleed of funding and backers. Kicktraq shows this KS trending to $1100, which is optimistic. I'm leaving my pledge up, but at this point realistically I'm waiting for Ice Age Mammals to re-sculpt and ship at the end of the month, and then see if a planned KS project follows. (<url>"The Sea Monster KS did not do well." Note the past tense. However, I am still holding out for a update. They have 7 days to produce sculps for all the models on this KS, or they've committed to cancelling if. 9 days now, is it? Christ... Well, they just posted in their other KS... At this point, no high hopes for this one, though. :< I'm outta here. Hope it works out for the rest of you! Adios amigos 6 days. no contact whatsoever. Something has had to have happened to make them go from friendly, chatty, very hands on creators to no contact at all. I sent a message directly to Dina asking her to either talk to us or cancel the kickstarter if she is no longer supporting it. Damn it! This kickstarter had a lot of things I really liked. I threw a $1 on this one to stay updated. The Sea Monsters didn't interest me, but some of the add-ons might be appealing. With the way other miniature KS are exploding it's sad to see one so quiet. They really need to focus on IAM, ship a great product, and then their future projects would fund like crazy. I figured you'd hand around AR :-) I suspect all the attention is being given to the IAM KS which is why it is quiet here. If all the modelling bandwidth goes on the IAM too, then I presume we won't be seeing a lot of model updates here for a while. It would be good to get an update from ADW Games ;-) Oh, I'm not going anywhere, Fox! I'll stay around and hang, do the plege sheet... But I only have ~50 a month to spend on KS, and if these guys don't stay on top of things, I'm not going to throw my money away... They sent out an update for the Hand-Sculpted Miniature Ice Age Mammal Set Kickstarter about 45 min ago saying everything for that one was fine. I don't know why they haven't responded here at all. Hopefully they will soon. I hope Dina and Lars are OK. It's been way too many days without any word. Come back Aard_Rinn - we miss you already ;-) Well, 5 hours later, and I'm thinking I might bail on this. It was a nice go, but for 30$, I think I'll sculpt my own mushrooms... And there are a couple of other KS that I feel more confident in. It's a shame - I really liked this company. I'll stay in for a buck, and if things pick back up, I may consider rebacking, but it'll take a lot.... Heres hoping the Mammals KS goes well and restores my faith. We miss you! Hey, Lars! Are you there? Come back! 12 days < 2 weeks. Where are the WYSIWIG add ons? Yup, I have to agree with Aard_Rinn ... at this point, I'm not impressed. The last (and only) update was 4 days ago and the last comment/interaction in this comments area was 3 days ago. Realm Master K is right. In my experience too, lack of communication is a killer for projects. If the creators/developers don't show that they care.... why should the backers? Even a tiny note to check in and let us know what you've been up to, would be good. They just updated the Ice age kickstarter. I left a comment asking for a little love over here. Hopefully someone gets it soon. Dina - We really need an update here. I sent out an update to the Awesome List which 1100 people got in their inboxes. When they come check out the project, they really need to see activity and communication. That is what inspires people to pledge for a project. In my experience dead air is something that is counterproductive to high funding. Please give us an update and come back to the comments section. Ah. Well, I gotta say, unimpressed. Check out Update #1 - It's from Lars, and then Dina drops in with a comment three days ago. So if I'm reading it right, everything EXCEPT sea monsters and big beasts is CAD now. I assume that means CAD is Dungeon Terrain Sets #1-3: walls, mushrooms, mushroom dudes, stalagmites, chairs, dinette sets, four-poster beds, fruit bats, and bones. (I'm pretty sure the furniture was always going to be CAD anyway, reading from the comments.) There's still two weeks to finish sculpts... Wait, Dina? I though we were switching to CAD because it's easier to do bitz when you can just use the cropline and stagger tools to make neat edges...? Dina came back and took over control of the project and was arranging to switch from hand sculpting to 3D/CAD rendering for the Dungeon and scenic pieces. Guess that all takes time to set up. I am not sure what is happening about the hand sculpted sea monsters and beasts, I assumed that was still continuing as before. But yeah, some information would be good. Yeah, this is getting pretty disappointing... What happened to the daily updates? It's been very quiet the past 2 days. This is not a complaint :-) I've been away from home for a few days and havn't been keeping up with comments / home page updates... So what is new? Weren't we supposed to get a photoupdate today? And an update of IAM? I like the idea of the angel... OK, don't know what others think but my 1/2/3 would be: 8 spoked wheel from the playing card images. Nautical type compass/dividers from the playing cards & logo. Crucified angel/bird from the logo. I think the rose would be a bit indistinct in 28mm size and skulls are too clichéd on fantasy miniatures/scenics thanks to GW excesses. Great update! Smaller pieces being done in 3D rendering should give a first class result and make it easy to keep a standard theme/style through all the pieces. Maybe the 4 poster bed, dresser and wardrobe can feature a carving of the same crest of arms or heraldic symbol on each. I was hoping to have an update today. Cool! I'll be looking foward to it! Any chance of a few more pictures today? I'd love to see what you guys got done... I would be interested in receiving my Ice Age Mammals pre-painted if at all possible. That would be really great. Not sure if that will be an option, but I bet it would be popular if it was. Hm... you know, you might be able to find a market for some of these sea monsters at aquariums. I know that the Maritime Aquarium has a lot of mythological bricabrac, and if you wrote up a little booklet about the monster in question and packaged it in something tasteful and subdued, they might be interested in selling these for mantlepieces and such... something that might be worth investigating? Awesome! I have absolutely no artistic talent to even try to paint, so I'd love pre-painted. =) oh and my vote would be for broken furniture :) This might be a silly question.... but will the finished product(s) come painted or unpainted? (or will their be a choice to have either or?) Liking the stalagmites so far! This is pre-detailing, right? Hm... at 10$ for twelve, I can probably spring for a couple. I don't do much cave stuff, but I'm picturing these as tall mushrooms, Avatar-style, or something more like Indian pipe... Painted with ivory outsides and blue glowing coming from within, these could be a lot of fun as a delicate light-shedding forest plant or magical mystery lamp, or with black/brown outsides and red glowing, they could make neat lava flumes/volcanic fungus/sorcerer's lamps... I would love to also have a set of crude furniture like you would expect to find in a troll's lair or an Orc encampment. I am totally down for both Intact Furniture and Broken Furniture, especially if they look similar enough that I can replace an intact piece with Broken bits as they are broken in a fight. That would be EPIC!! I would also love to have access to more Stalagmites. Hehe it's ok, I retweeted =) Woohoo! I'd retweet, but I dinnae have a twitter... Congratulations!! You're a Kickstarter Staff Pick!! \o/ <url>"may change" caveats) and add the set to the front page like you have the monster lair done. People looking at Kickstarters from forum links etc like to see updates as it shows the progress so far and upcoming goals of the project. Edit: Done! @robh - I think those are more like the direction they're heading? It doesn't make much sense if those are the precise ones they're going to do... more of an artistic direction, I think. A shattered throne might be cool, though... something fancy! Furniture designs are good for me, swap out chair 7 for a wardrobe (you have chairs with the table set) and I don't understand no 10 (lovely diorama though it is) or is that the look you are going for with the entire set (before the orcs ransack it)? That chair is awesome, with the lion-drake? I love stuff with animals carved in... but the whole set looks good. If you do a canopy-bed, can we get some big, smooth surfaces and nice, broad curves in the folds of the curtains, to make things easier on us freehanders? Edit: New pledge levels? FFS... :D Give me a minute... Walls? Walls! Glad to see Ice-Wall-with-Dwarf-Skull is back, as well as the Rosy-Thorn Wall- very cool. (Maybe an Wall of Bedazzlement, or the Wall of Gears as stretch goals?) I'm in for all the dungeon dressing, of course, but you might want to double-check what's already been done in the Mushroom-and-Stalagmites Department. Check out the ones already shipping from Dwarven Forge in a couple of months (they also made a stalagtite that reaches down to ground level): <url>"bowl" formations where they form a flat low rimmed bowl alongside or in the junction between 2 pillar forms. The shallow bowls will look great filled with toxic colours and gloss varnish. Also as AR says, some fungi clinging to them and maybe bones around on the bases. Make them free standing or with minimal irregular shaped bases. Furniture ideas sound good, but need to see some concepts/pictures. Hi all! I think broken furniture would be quite useful, and fairly unique. Robh's room description is bang on. The key is useful, versatile pieces that are not being created by a dozen other companies. So far Adwgames is excelling at that! Some other ideas: Monster beds/nests, rubble, makeshift barricades, smashed wagon, torture devices, corpse/pile of corpses (how gruesome!) That would be very cool, especially if you made a few clusters... I'd really love to see some small details on the bases, like you were going to do with the walls. A skull at the base of one, some tiny mushrooms growing next to another, stuff like that? Just to give it a little more detail and make it more interesting to paint? Really? Awesome! ... I don't know what either of those is. I'm interested in a few things to use on my outdoor mats, that could help add elevation and interesting things for my players to explore in conjunction with some of the bigger monsters you guys are making? I was thinking that ruined castle pieces could be used in forests, or also as underwater ruins, and stuff like that... if I've completely missed what you guys were going for, nevermind! :I Oh, by the way - a sofa. Seats ripped up, with stuffing everywhere. Would be *so much fun* to paint... Holy shit, I think I just accidentally a wall of text... did *not* realize how much I was blabbering! Broken Furniture, definitely broken. "...as you push gently on the old wooden door it slowly creaks open revealing what was once an ornate and well funished bedroom. Only now the wardrobe and dresser lie smashed and broken against the wall to your left, the once inspiring 4 poster bed is a wrecked and ruined pile of barely recognisable timbers and rags over to your right. Other piles of timber around the room could once have been expensive wooden chests and tables. From the stench and wanton destruction you can see you are not the first people to have come across this place..." I'd prefer a goodly bit of broken stuff - IDK what other people prefer... Some stuff that's basically flattish rubble piles - smashed desks and stuff like that that can mark uneven terrain or areas to investigate - and then stuff that's around 1" tall and 1", 2" or 3" inches long that can serve as cover and obstructions for players and their enemies. If you were thinking of doing a few larger pieces (which I would love!) some pieces with a x3 or so base area that are ~2 or even 3" high might be fun - for example, caved in bits of roof with stones, cobbles, wooden beams, and slate shingles that provide a 35* incline or so that players can climb, perch on, and use as cover? Or a bombed-out (dragoned-out?) hovel, like 3x5" and 1-2" high, that can be used as a base of operations for a wargame or as a ruined cottage in the woods? Something like this, without the tree (or with an optional treestump that can be glued in? I think it looks lovely, but making something like that a two-parter would offer more variety and make it easier to paint...): <url>" base would be perfect. Small and light enough to move without having to worry about frailty, large enough to make an impressive piece, and hopefully inexpensive enough that two or three could make up a small school of full-grown, smaller whales, or a group of attendants to a big one, or mounts for merpeople. Stuff like that. Littleones littleones littleones. As add-ons, maybe? Or stretch goals> But some smaller, easier to use ones might be good for RPGers who won't necessarily have a chance to use a huge model more than once or twice... Thanks for the links, you guys. I do a fair bit of acrylic clay modeling (fimo is my muse, god bless 64c/block days at my local craft stores) and I use alcohol to smooth mine. Already 2/5ths of the way to goal - excellent! Would be great if you could make a photo journal of one of the large beasts from start to finish. Your sculpting style/technique is very different from the standard gamer figures epoxy putty method. People more used to the smooth clean look of WIP epoxy sculpts are having a hard time understanding where you go from the rough dremel cut look of your WIP images. Looks like I'm Lucky # 13 Love the Walls, Monster Lair Terrain and shrooms aka fungi Looking forward to the stretch goals Big days are the best days! I'll update the list with finished sculpts as we see them! Yeah, I think that the waterspout will be really cool. Some fallen logs might be cool to go with the treestumps, too - they're basically low walls for swamps... I like the dungeon scenics list. Assuming the Recognisable Debris is in the main pledge I would vote for these as a priority (based on the ready availability of some of the other items already) Ransacked tomb (add-on) Water spout and Whirlwind (add-on) Stalagmites (free and add-on) Medieval torture Chamber (add-on) Woo! Much happy abounds! So, do people who back at the 75$ level get one of every unlocked terrain? Or do they only get the "free" ones? Ooo... Myconids are always cool! I love your refreshing take on gaming miniatures! It seems obvious in hindsight to look for historical inspiration for the sculpts (here and on the ice age project), but you are the ones who brought it to the table. Keep up the great work! I wouldn't mind a few more mushrooms as a stretch goal, either. Some ideas: Morels False Morel Golden Jelly fungus Violet Coral Fly Algaric (a true classic, and one of the most distinctive mushrooms out there!) Devil's Cigar Some mushroom-themed figures might be cool too. A mushroom troll, perhaps, with a body that looks almost wooden, covered in turkey-tails and agaric? Moss growing up his feet, and so on? Or an optional frog that can be attached to one of the mushrooms, crawling up over the edge of the cap, hind legs kicking as it tries to get up? Stuff like that might be fun - add a little fantasy flair to the mushrooms set! Lars: Sounds good. Don't forget virtually all dungeon games base models and game movement on 25mm grids with most corridor sections being 50mm wide. On the list I passed to Dina, Monster Lairs (Orc, Troll, Goblin etc) and 'Recognisable Debris' (the remains of smashed wardrobes, dressers, writing desks etc) are the things really lacking in existing ranges. Quetzal might make a cool mythical god-bird, too, now I look at it... I'd love to see some smaller sea creatures - selkies, mermaids, and such! Some elementals, again, would be great, especially sea-creature themed - sea lions, turtles, osprey and so on... I'd also love to see a sea serpent modeled with the leafy sea dragon in mind. I've seen some great examples in drawings, but never a sculpt I liked. And as a last thought... achiyalabopa. Punch it into google. Would make a good buddy for our friend the simurgh, right? O-P Yeah, I sent you a PM, Lars! Looking good! I'm adding the concept art to the list... I've also unlocked it, Robh. Just for you. Happy birthday, or something! Pledged to get that sweet hippocampus! Shared on FB and twitter, good luck! AR, you have the pledge list on password access only. Hi, How soon can we get some concept pictures of the dungeon pieces? I swapped a few mails with Dina about these, would be great to see what you have planned. BAM! Who's the fastest? Aard's the fastest. Pledge list! <url>#gid=0
