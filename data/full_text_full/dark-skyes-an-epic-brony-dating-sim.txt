Dark Skyes is a pony dating sim with deep RPG elements, for PC, Mac, and Linux. Four years in the making, Dark Skyes is not your average dating sim. It is a journey that spans multiple continents; a quest of good against evil; and a search for true love, fulfillment, and self discovery--all rolled into one. You are the new pony in town. You've got a lot to prove, and any respect you get must be earned. Most of the ponies in Cirrus City are nice, but they definitely don't trust strangers right off the bat, so you'll have to work hard for them to warm up to you, and build a network of real friends to help you when times get tough. You don't just "win" at a relationship and that's it. Through your interactions with other ponies, you'll have to prove that you're honest, compassionate, kind, loving, and capable of helping a friend in need. If you treat ponies unfairly, or refuse to help out when a fellow pony really needs a hand, expect the game to be a lot harder! If, and only if, you are able to prove to the ponies of this magical land that you are worth a darn, then perhaps you are the one who can bring everyone together and dispel the dark fog that looms on the horizon. You must learn about love, and you must use this love in order to bring light back to the land. During this final part of the game, the odds will be stacked against you, but perhaps if you've got friends at your side and love in your heart, you can make it through to see the light of day. The development team is made up of some of the best and brightest talent from all over the globe, featuring indie game design vets as well as inexperienced young guns with everything to prove and nothing to lose. We're not coming to Kickstarter with some half-baked idea, no no no. In fact, our alpha build is already done, with placeholder artwork (and most of the final artwork is done, just not inserted yet). Nearly every part of the game has already been completed with our own blood, sweat and tears (and of course money). However, putting the finishing touches on this game has proven to be expensive, and we can't just let our awesome artists and voice-over actors to go unpaid. We don't need much more, but realistically we've got to drum up $7500 to get this last round of revisions done, cover all the bases, and make the game as good as it deserves to be. That's it ponies. $7500 isn't much for a game of this scope and quality, and at the end of the day none of us really care about money. We would honestly do this for free if it meant bringing a smile to your faces, and if you seriously can't afford $10 and you want to play this game, email us and we'll hook you up for free. Our goal here is to create a sense of wonderment and awe, and truly convey the ideals of friendship and love through an awesome game that you can play over and over. We hope to create a game that people will remember for a long time, and maybe make a few friends along the way. Thanks for checking us out, and we hope to see you soon! BRO-HOOF! We've gotten a lot of messages from people asking what happens if we don't meet the funding goal. The good news is, the game will still get finished! The bad news is, if funding fails, we plan on pitching the finished game to publishers, a process which could take a year or more. We're hopeful that you ponies will be able to pull it together and get us to our goal, but if not, never fear, for we are still fully committed to the Dark Skyes project and delivering to you folks the game you deserve! Best wishes to all, and please cross your fingers for us! Still think it's a scam? Troll harder. We've been having trouble bringing the alpha into playable shape in time for the end date of this Kickstarter. It was never our intention to have a demo in place, but because of the trolls and scammers we have been forced to show *something*, so here it is you guys :) This is a little mini-demo that we whipped up in a couple hours. It should give you an *idea* of what the game will be like, but you absolutely CAN NOT assume that this demo is indicative of the final quality of the real game. We are professionals and we are committed to quality and excellence. This is just something to shut up the haters! Lastly, to end things on a positive note, I can't tell you guys how much the team appreciates all the messages of support and the fact that some of you are still sticking with us. This whole ride has been crazy but there may yet be light at the end of the tunnel. ONWARD! *Sigh*... we were really hoping that we wouldn't have to release any actual visuals until the game was up to our own high standards, but because of this trolling/scam campaign nonsense we have been forced to put something together to show you guys. This is really unfortunate. The reason why big game studios don't release development stuff like this is because it's not representative of the final quality of the game and it turns people off. It is negative hype. But this is what we had to do, I feel, and hopefully this will put to rest some of the misgivings that our ACTUAL fans have. I don't really care about the haters and the people trying to bring us down at this point, but for the people who have actually backed this project and stand by us, well, thank you guys &amp; girls. I'll be posting a playable demo later this week probably. Please keep in mind that it is a TEMPORARY demo, not at all up to our standards of finished quality. That's all, love you :) So, as many of you are probably aware, we are currently the target of a very advanced and sophisticated smear-job by patriarchs of the forum known as 4chan.org/pony/ . They have photoshopped conversations, falsified information, harassed us to the point of tears, and successfully driven away some of our major backers. Since then, we've received over 200 messages, all reasonably concerned about the legitimacy of this project. I've taken the time to reply to most of them, in as much detail as time will allow, but at the end of the day there is still much work to be done. At this point we have two options: 1.) Spend weeks trying to reverse the damage that has been done by these trolls, and maybe win back one or two major backers. 2.) Finish the game, get a playable demo out as soon as possible, and watch these fools and villains eat their hats. We're going with option 2. We understand if some of you want to pull your donations, in which case we'll have to just hope that you change your mind when the game is released. But for the rest of you, those of you who believe in indie games, who believe in ponies and pony magic, stand with us. Stand with us against these bullies, and walk with us through the fire to see Dark Skyes become a reality. That's it. Thank you very much. Please see the above video for a little word on the legitimacy of this project! And please continue supporting us! We definitely don't have time to play public relations and be making videos and answering questions all day... we have a game to finish you guys. A lot of people have expressed interest in seeing the alpha build, as well. No problem. We'll upload our alpha for you to try out as soon as we can see the alpha builds for Doom 4, Halo 6, Starcraft III, and Skyrim 3. C'mon people. There's a reason why major studios don't give players the inside scoop during development. Alpha builds are ugly, and they turn players off more often than not. Our alpha build looks particularly terrible, and it will continue to look that way until we've finished swapping out all the placeholder artwork with the final stuff. No matter how technically proficient the game is in it's current state, The Intarnot will take one look at it, say "it looks like crap," and write it off forever. Sorry, not happening. Speaking of swapping out the placeholder artwork, we've run into a bit of a snag, as the resolution of the final art isn't matching up with the placeholders in a lot of cases. This shouldn't take us more than a day or two to figure out, but it's not going to get done if I have to hold a press conference every time some stupid forum decides to troll us for being bronies. Sorry if this comes off as rude--not my intent at all--it’s just that I get made fun of enough in real life, and I’d much prefer to spend my time thinking about the game to be quite honest! For those of you sending in messages of support: you rule. And we are not gonna let you down. Dear Dark Skyes supporters and fans: Our credibility and the future of our game itself are currently under attack by members of the forum known as Something Awful . I am still not even sure what is going on, but from what I can see they have been collaborating with some 4chan group and making fake screen shots to try and paint us as a group of scammers. This is ridiculous. I am using my real name (I'll show you my license in a video that I'll post soon), and my bank account is tied to this thing... There's no way in hell I'd ever risk getting sued and possibly thrown in jail for a stupid prank. Get real. We figured that by throwing ourselves out there and making a game like this, we'd be opening the floodgates for the trolls, we just didn't realize it would be happening so soon! Now we can only hope that the support of our fans is strong enough to drown out these jerks who are trying to discredit us! I'm going to make a video right now, talking about this in a little more detail, but I just wanted to drop you guys a line and let you know that everything is cool, and we are still chuggin' along full steam ahead! Seems like there is a bit of confusion about this. The voiceovers used in the pitch video are webcam auditions, and the quality is really poor. But, not to worry! The final audio for the game was and is being recorded in a $5000 Studiobricks recording booth on a Rode K2 microphone, connected to all kinds of expensive pre-amps and flip-flops and gizmos that I don't know the name of. It sounds awesome. We are perfectionists folks. You don't have to worry about any aspect of this game being anything less than triple-A quality :) Hey backers and potential backers--don't let Reddit shut us down! Please check the updates often, and we are hoping to have a visual demo up and running for you guys in a few weeks. Even if you don't choose to back this project, please stay tuned to this channel for updates because once you see the game up and running, we would still like you to play it! ����������������������� Bad news, fellow Kickstarterers...Yoshi-K just emailed me that he's abandoning his brony dating sim and going ahead with a full sex change. Well let's hope he finds happiness in whatever sordid coupling is next up for him (if any). This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. Oh-shoot! Hey Yoshi-K, do you have a deviantart account by any chance? This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. epic brony dating sim? more like... epic freaking fail! lmao. I look forward to the next MDE Kickstarter! *wet farting noise for several consecutive minutes* Can't believe people still fell for this scam! looool, You guys were getting trolled on the hardest level! No that is my OC. The cutie mark is different and the eyes are bluer than Leuna. thank you for trying to make this happen, though. it's been hilarious watching you guys get owned so hard by fans of a freakin children's cartoon lmao. thanks yoshi for actually looking up the avatar art if I cared I'd help look up the rest of these avs for all the fake accounts, but there's only ten hours left so it's pledge withdrawin' time 2 and a half weeks of effort since start. Its more effort then Michael and MDE put into this game, Also no offense but you look a little like a fake account made by MDE using an OC stolen from here. <url>"As it stands now Dark Skyes is either: 1. A prank that will result in either no product for backers, or a product that is a joke and bears no resemblance to what was offered. 2. A poorly run campaign with an organizer that changes vital information (dev team) without notice, is losing support from his staff, and feels that responding to backers and press is a waste of his time. Whichever way the campaign ends it is one I highly suggest you steer clear of if you’re expecting the Brony Dating sim advertised. Money given to the Dark Skyes campaign will either be lost, or part of a joke that has already been outed." I would like to apologize for believing the things the haters were saying and after going through and reading below I now believe in this project and I have gave my share of money for this to be made. And I root for you all. Do your best, everyone! Oh it will Amanda, but by my team, not theirs. At least, the game on the front page more or less. Even if they make a game, I doubt it will be anywhere close to what they pitched. I hope this game gets made anyway! Even if it doesn't get funded. This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. While I find some humor in how you described a sex scene no. Dating, kissing, romance, all of that yes. They promised a PG-13 game, thats what will be delivered, one way or the other. This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. Not since there is still a real, serious, game being made. This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. I would say it's quite possible. Maybe both? I dont know Stephen, you tell us. <url>"Bravo." Your last-ditch effort to convince us this project is both real and competently run, and you try to pull the oldest trick in the project manager's book. Your "playable demo" is suddenly downgraded to a video of something that could've been thrown together in Powerpoint, or hacked together in Unity, in about a day. Complete with multiple fades to hide the fact that there's literally nothing connecting the scenes that were shown, which were all the same pictures you already posted screenshots of, with only some more text (which wouldn't exactly be hard to come up with pretty quickly). Still no explanation for the Japanese text in one of the screenshots unquestionably referring to an explicit sexual act in spite of its claimed translation, either. In short, even if this ISN'T a scam, or even a troll, there is no way you're 95% done, no way you know what you're doing, and no way anyone should be trusting you with their money. So...yeah. You pretty much blew it. There's not much left to say. My work here is done, and the money of true bronies is safe from trolls for another day, unless you try to pull what alex said of shill bidding at the last minute. You said from the beginning that "We would honestly do this for free if it meant bringing a smile to your faces." So, better get to putting your lack of money where your mouth is. Just gonna go ahead and point out the very real possibility of someone from MDE funding the remaining amount right before their deadline just to rob people who have backed this just to provide information/etc. So make sure if you've backed it just to get updates and comment knowing it's a scam, to withdraw your pledge before the KS is over rather than gambling on it not getting funded :3 cheers He liked Fluttershy, Faust, and Bronies on his Facebook, most of which is private. I fail to see your evidence for him standing up against the mountain of evidence against him considering he just showed a demo of a 95% done game four years in the making before the MLP craze. He showed a demo with concept art from an artist who back out and is on the team making the real game. It showed something barely scraped together that again showed off what they said was an almost completed game. If there was evidence that a real game was made, that this wasnt some big ole joke or whatever it plans to be, I would be inclined to believe you. But at this point, there is just too much against what they originally pitched. You dont have to work in game development If you dont believe there is no connection to MDE, look at the original roster of folks that were on the "Development" Team. <url>"scam" fiasco I was just as hesitant as some of you. I did hours of research looking at both sides of the argument. And in the end, I had to side with Michael. And as for Bootaca's last post; your whole argument rests on the fact that Dark Skyes is a scam! Which I assure you it isn't. It's a tough world and people need to do whatever they can to get by, and if people can do that by making videos on YouTube GOOD FOR THEM! That means that they don't have to take to the streets. Everyone needs money, it's sad but true. And honestly? I feel sorry for you people... That for some reason you feel the need to rip on a project like this when it's just a bunch of people doing what they want to do. It's people who think like that that keep the world from moving forward. If we could all just take a moment and realize how petty we're all being we might just be able to turn this messed up world of ours a little brighter. But I digress. This is about a game, and the people who are making it, who are honestly just doing what they like and trying to give back to the community. I can't force you to pledge, I can't force you to take a chance and believe in people. I can just say this with complete certainty. I AM AT MICHAEL'S BACK TO THE VERY END, AND I WON'T GIVE UP MY BELIEF IN HIM. This user's account has been deleted. That's great Liana. You have several free projects to choose from. I haven't checked it out, but there is one right below you in the comments. Sam's t-shirt venture (his last project) resulted in no product for anyone who paid him money. This project's crew have disintegrated (those who even knew that thier names were associated with it). Even at this late stage, when Sam has to play it totally straight and convince the punters that this project is real, he can't resist insulting everyone. Take a look at the new 'game images'. See that Japanese text in the quiz page: ぶっかけ 劇場 ? Make sure you are not at work and google it (very NSFW). That's what Sam is. That's what this project is. Look, if you aren't convinced this is a scam by now, then nothing in this world will convince you. Yes, these people want your money so they can make a cheap mockery of a pony dating sim, and most likely it will be a cheap piece of shit. But is that really so different from any other dating sim? Honestly, I'm pretty excited to see the flaming hunk of burning crap they shovel out, because my life is devoid of human warmth and I am pretty desperate for any laughs I can get. Yup, this game is being falsely advertised, but it could still whittle away the bitter hours I spend conscious, and that's fine by me. Alright PinkypieBrony, I'm sure you know who I am, if not that's fine too. On the 17th of this month, I created a game called "It's Always Sunny in Dark Skyes". Got the video out showing the roughest of Alpha footage only 3 to 4 days later. <url>"screenshots" of the 95% done game that was being made for 4 years. So I leave it to anyone reading these comments. You can either put money into a thing that seems like a scam, smells like a scam and probably tastes like a scam, with mountains of evidence stacked against it. Or you can just wait for my game to be developed, ya know, the one that actually proves its a game. Up to you all. More lies spread by the trolls and liars of 4chan and something awful! Don't believe these miscreants they only want to bring the project down and stop all us cool bronies from getting an awesome Game. Recent backers for this project may not have seen this: <url>#chart-daily Dark Skyes would need to have around 350$ or better in donations per day, from now until project end to make its funding target. Judging from the last week of donation history, Dark Skyes is not even close to reaching this needed daily target. This is also factoring in that none of the current backers at any point withdraw, or reduce their contributions. Everyone can argue their points, but the backers have already spoken; and unless something very surprising happens, this project is already dead. The only question now is if they are going to drag it out for the full week and a half or not. Hi Amanda. Concerning information in the article not being true I welcome any kind of correction suggestions, I want to be sure we're presenting the truest picture possible. I look forward to any feedback. A lot of the information in that article has been proven not to be true, or is the developers distancing themselves after trolls started harrassing them for being a part of the project. This user's account has been deleted. When did they ever that claim that? This user's account has been deleted. There's really no reason to be concerned about the trolls. They'll be out of a job soon enough. This user's account has been deleted. And you think it's okay to harrass people to the point of tears? Because they're bronies? On what planet is that okay? This user's account has been deleted. Diane, I haven't told you where he lives. You and the other trolls have looked up his address, phone number, facebook, and family members. The harrassment needs to stop. It's illegal. This user's account has been deleted. Diane that's the location where Michael Harms works. Your post was telling where he lives. Fall River is close to the Rhode Island border and a lot of people commute there from Providence to work. Posting where someone lives is NEVER appropriate. It's called harrassment. This user's account has been deleted. This user's account has been deleted. Trolls were looking up personal information about the developers by using their pictures on the site (addresses, places of work, friends, family). That's why they asked to have the pictures taken down, which they were. Now you're posting where the developers live. What is wrong with you? Why can't you leave them alone? Diane why are you posting personal information about the developers' personal addresses? This user's account has been deleted. This user's account has been deleted. I really wonder just how badly somebody wants this project to die, scam listing on many sites, fake founder accounts that them get deleted, fake conversation with questionable sources, more videos from MDE than I can count, more I look into the detractors to this project the more it appears that MDE or a similar group is trying to kill it. Evidence that suggest they are the once who started piles up yet no link to the actual project owner show up. I will be honest I have given to the project more to see what the true story is than to play the game. But i this is legit, all the power to Bronies, however if it is not, funding it may be the only way to find out more about what the plan is. Either, I hope this project is funded, I think it is worth the price to find out and I hope more will help so we can all know. This user's account has been deleted. Hey guys. I hope this game makes it. Looks different and not something I've ever played before but I like rpgs of all types and hope this is cool. Plus I love watching My little pony. I can't say that I'm a Brony but I guess I'm a male fan of MLP so that may count for something. I know you guys have had a lot of trolls and that sucks. Good luck. So many trolls :( fapping to ponies is just straight up WEIRD. That is all. This user's account has been deleted. Mokoto I don't see a pony avatar or any support in your comments for us bronys how do we know your a real pony backer dont just be another hater trying to troll and insult the integrity of this great project to give a good game for all bronys! :) I gave $1 @Michael Harms By the way that video isn't quite new and Sam Hyde isn't Psychoactive Charm, he's somebody else. Thank you Michael, your a godsend :) The Bronys should be proud to have a great game maker you producing this product. @Michael Harms Thanks! :) This user's account has been deleted. Well said Amanda we should be more respectful for bronys and lovers of pony that want this awesome game everywhere! :) Hey guys I hope you didn't forget the text next to the post button that says we're supposed to be respectful and considerate. :) Just because you haven't heard of the beta testing, that must mean it's not real? I guess air isnt real because I cannot see it than. You dont even know about the Gold Packaging for the game either or all the unlockable content so how can you say its not real when the whole game is very much finished and developed by now. And Im sorry do you prefer luna instead not everyone loves the same ponys as you but you cannot bring down this awesome game project just because your taste are bad! Question me on being a brony one more time just you dare any trivia and I can deliver ive been a fan since 5 years ago I can handle it :) This user's account has been deleted. Michael I've listen to many of the games soundtrack they sound really great and I'm so proud to be part of the beta testers to see the first exclusive access to Dark Skyes free demo which has revealed many true and fun aspects about this game that bronies will love. And so Im not a brony just because I spell pinkie differently shame on you how could you accuse me. Im into all the of the show, my favorite pony is Twilight and I love her great fashion sense! Fluttershy is so cute and praise the Moon Celestia is your goddess XD!! And do you think that trolling these comments and questioning me enough is going to disprove this game it's already developed fully and you cannot stop it just wait until it comes out it will be so good and all your haters are going to regret trying to prevent us trye and loved bronys from getting a great game. Good to hear :) Wow. People are ACTUALLY still trolling this? I think you've had your fun people, time to move on. Chill out, play a game, have a good time with your family (or the person closest to you if you don't have any), just don't waste any more of your time trying to run this kickstarter into the ground, it's pointless. The brony fandom will have a game and while you haters might even be able to trick some naive minds into avoiding this, I know a lot of people who know better and - in time - will pledge a great deal of money to support the funding of this very special project! By the way, next time you trolls insult the project creators and its fans alike, at least try not to use logical fallacies or completely baseless arguments. It makes you seem like a total ****. Making fake accounts of the developers and "acknowledging that your own project is fake" doesn't help. At last, let me get a peaceful, well-intentioned open message across all those who comment on DS refusing to believe it's real: Lighten up, listen to your favourite music, sip a nice warm coffee, have a good laugh at humorous content on the internet and try your best to simply ignore this project. Act like it's not there. I'm sure it's not being advertised all over the web, so essentially we're not "shoving it down your throat" either. All this hating, bullying and trolling is bad for your physical and mental health, and I'm sure your life will take a turn for the better if you're able to follow these simple guidelines! @Michael Harms I know that's a fake/troll account, now quit hating and leave us alone. ~Josh This user's account has been deleted. I've gotta admit. You were right about one thing, Sam. This project IS making me laugh. All the fake accounts and going "Nuh uh!" to all the evidence levelled against it. It's rather hilarious watching you all squirm. |3 Hiroshima probably backed out of this project because they were nervous about all the trolls picking on them, just like the rest of the developers. It's a safer and smarter choice for him to back out and have him and his brother obscured and work behind the scenes so they can work hard on the Brony project, instead of having to respond to and deal with Trolls And Amanda's right as long as they took off his picture and mention its okay now because hes no longer associated with this project except for when hes working on it. Diane what do his activites have to do with anything you could be a wanted criminal but that doesnt meant you dont know how to make a sandwiche or or brony game. All Hiro meant in thos pics is he didnt want to be associated for fear of being troll on, otherwise the pictures are faked. Stop spreading dirty ratty lies and misinformation to try to get this game not supported you haters! Bronys unite, and support this great game! You all know it will be worth it :). What I mean is as long as Hiroshima has forgiven them. As long as they removed his picture like he asked it's not that big of a deal. This user's account has been deleted. I'm so glad to have backed this game, Dark Skyes which supports epic graphics, totally cool voice acting and the wickedest sound track! I swear it was like listening to Mozart's, just like in my favorite pony cartoons! And Troll Police, even if you are trolling as your name suggest, this game has been made mostly and is very real. The evidence on the kickstarter video proves it and is very well organized and you seem like some sort of Brony hater for not wanting to support this game. Those videos and pages were obviously made by trolls trying to distract Michael from making such a great game, anyone could make a video and say there associated with someone, but it takes evidence to prove it. This game won't mock us, it will embrace us bronys and our pony culture so we can date our favorite ponys and play a great game! Stop trying to hard to doubt it and deceive others you sabatagoe supporter Cad! Bronys support this game and look forward to Dark Skyes being completed! If you want to see the game they're advertising be made, backing this project isn't gonna help with that. There's incontrovertible proof of MDE's involvement, the fact that the game is going to be a joke and not as described, and that MDE has no respect for its supposed target audience, what with calling us "retards" and all. I'll take ruining this project over people paying for a serious attempt at a dating sim and winding up with a joke that mocks them and their fandom. If you want that kind of a game, fine, actually call it that, instead of making a big fake out project. Target your pony-mocking game at the pony-mockers instead of the pony-lovers. And yeah, I'm a troll, but I'm a troll trolling trolls. ^_^ Just because you call yourself "troll police" doesn't make you any less of a troll. There are some of us who really want to see this game get made. Please please please don't ruin it for everyone else. Hello newly-created pony-avatar account! I am fellow newly-created pony-avatar account! Unfortunately, I must inform you that you are quite wrong, the evidence is overwhelming and has already been provided that this project is somewhere between "completely incompetently run and unsafe to back" and "outright scam and/or troll." Please don't comment if you're a fake account made by someone involved with the project in an attempt to save face. ^_^ There is no evidence of anything being a scam. Please don't comment if you're not a serious backer and are only here to troll. Just a friendly reminder that this is a scam and if you're viewing the comments page after you've backed it I urge you to scroll down for all the proof you should need to want to retract your pledge. Most everything you need to know about the scam is here: <url>"My Money~!". I am suspecting the count would be at least three :D I also highly suspect these $750 backers will all quite mysteriously withdraw their backing before the projects completion/the money is due. Call me Nostradamus; for I can clearly see this in the future. Oldest fundraising trick in the book, throw a few of your own dollars in first to then get others donating. One does have to rather admire MDEs dedication to the prank/scam though. Even after announcing it is/was a prank quite willingly and publicly on a youtube video, losing their artist (and the only non-MDE member on the project staff), being caught out lying/faking members of their project staff list, still providing absolutely no evidence that there IS a game, in no way refuting any of these easily verifiable claims that this is a MDE prank, yet still out there shilling for bronies to donate to the 'project'. All I can say at this point to anyone legitimately donating is 'Caveat emptor', 'let the buyer beware'. They (MDE) have already admitted this project is a prank, after all. tight, i love horses hehe 750 from maybe with the power of positive endorsements we might still be able to fix this major problem that happened to this game I do not know how much more simple I can make this. Sam Hyde of 'Million Dollar Extreme' the pranking/trolling group has gone on record, on youtube claiming this is one of their projects. That it is a prank, that they were/are being intentionally misleading about the project, that the end product is most likely going to 'Piss people off'. But its all OK, because supposedly its going to be funny. It is not a question of if this is a scam, they already openly admitted it on youtube it is one of their 'pranks'. The questions are what they are really doing, why Kickstarter is allowing this still to continue, and why exactly it is bronies should be funding their own trolling by MDE through a misleading kickstarter project? The fact that Dark Skyes was caught bold-faced lying about who is even working on this project should have already disqualified them with Kickstarter. Now, I enjoy a good joke as well as the next, but it is done now. If the project fesses up to what they are REALLY up to, who knows? I might even toss a few bucks in. But the 'Oh! but this project is soooo legit!' boat sailed a few days ago already. I love it! I can't wait until you guys release this gem, the trailer looked astounding! I don't know what everyone's problem with this is, I know the creator from other websites and I know how much of a fellow pony fan he his, accusing the team of trying to scam people is completely irrational :( Also Kickstarter doesn't accept scams and it's is very strict with the projects submitted here to make sure everything's legitimate. Make this game happen, guys! I'm hyped for it! Drake: Not quite. 'Brony' is a phrase specifically created by fans of G4/Fausts re-envisioned MLP in referring to themselves. So, while a brony may also be a fan of older gens, or an G1 fan may also be a brony. Simply being a fan of older generations does not automatically qualify one as a brony. So, this being said; this game saying that it is a "Epic Brony Dating Sim" and 'Four years in the making" cannot be correct. I mis-spoke a bit earlier, and what I should have said is that the show (G4) is itself barely four years old, this if this is a brony dating that was sim four years in the making then it predates the existence of the brony (G4) fandom itself. A highly dubious claim. If it was titled as a 'Pony dating sim' then it could refer to older generations, but it specifically mentions 'brony'; which is G4. Also, on my list of problems. There is no estimated date of project completion. One could in theory, make a doodle or two once or twice a month, or spend a few moments on code, and still quite legitimately refer to the project as 'in progress' pretty much indefinitely. Aslo, the disclaimer tacked onto the end of the project "Elements of this game are subject to change, even the title and the artwork for the ponies." could be taken as 'carte blanche' that MDE could then produce pretty much anything they wanted if the funding was successful and still be within their disclaimer rights. Im still pledging but i have to downgrade for now. I need my money elsewhere but ill be back. Who wants to bet a few bitcoins on Trixie no longer being a backer 23 days from now (assuming the project hasn't been pulled by then)? Brad a little info I'm tossing your way. The brony fandom was here since gen 1. It may have been in shambles and not very herd of but it was there. Lets look at the facts: 1) Almost the entire staff is composed of people associated with 'Million Dollar Extreme' a known pranking/trolling group. The 'Million Dollar Extreme' connection was verified by none other then Sam Hyde (Head Troll of MDE) who also in his youtube video about the project claimed that "We went about it in a disingenuous way, It was going to be a little prank", Basicially admitting that while a game was being planned, the game was not going to be what it was advertised as. It may be as Sam said "Funny as hell"; but that is NOT the game that is being advertised and being crowd funded. 2) The artist involved in the project very wisely decided to back out after the MDE connection was made, and the legitimacy of the project was in serious question. 3) One of the supposed staff on the project, listed as 'Programmer + sound' Chris Conlon, has disavowed any knowledge of, or that they worked on the "Dark Skyes" project. They have since been removed from the list and been replaced with Virgo Hiroshima. One has to wonder that if the project creator(s) lied about their staff, what else is being lied about? 4) Questionable claims. The game is "Four years in the making". The fandom is barely four years old, so unless this project was planned just after the very first few episodes were aired and the brony fandom was not even in existence as of yet, that is another lie the project is caught in. 95% done, and yet there are no screenshots, demos or the like? The two images shown are obvious photoshops. Infact, for the second image (Pumpkin Pie) the text in the "How could you..." window was not lined up correctly and trails off the 'button'. 30+ songs? Then who are the artists? why not throw a few names out there? If it is a dating sim, why are there weapons? Why is there no real description of the storyline or plot elements other then the most vague generalities if there is 100+ hours of gameplay? The truth is, the project has already been caught in and/or admitted to several lies with Dark Skyes. Either some real information comes out proving that this is a real project, or Kickstarter needs to shut this down. If MDE wants to troll bronies, then they can do it on their own dime; not though funding raised in a falsely advertised Kickstarter project. Man, so many people are so gullible. So what if they haven't released an Alpha of the game? Doesn't mean it's fake. I mean, who would put so much work and effort into a video and go through so much trouble just to get a couple thousand dollars? You have to think about what they're doing! They're so close to finishing an amazing looking game! I'm sure all of you want to play it. Remember, not everything on the internet is true. And besides, if it is fake, we'll have plenty of evidence to show who were in on it, and they'll be caught by next week, but I know that will and won't be the case. I'm looking forward to this amazing looking game and can't wait to play it! Come on guys. I've got 20 bitcoins ready to cash in, just say the word. Two days now without an official update? I thought for sure that getting caught was part of the master plan. Why else would you guys have made it so easy to figure out? I mean using your real names and the same editing style is one thing, but continuing to tweet about it even once the kickstarter went live? Let's just say these master rusemen obviously have something else up their sleeves ;-) I feel a little disappointed in those three who backed out of their $750 pledge just because of a rumor that has no real proof. I say innocent until proven guilty. Hey guys, really hoping yea hit yea mark somehow even with my piddly dosh, been waiting for something like this from the community for a while now, best of luck and all! This user's account has been deleted. can we get an official response from the creators re: this troubling news? I'd like to see just what we're getting before I commit any more money. I could singlehandedly pledge enough to meet the goal but I just can't without knowing more. By now it should be common knowledge that this is actually a Million Dollar Extreme project. (something I actually already knew when I donated) This game WILL come out and it WILL be hilarious They are not just going to take your money and run, they would never risk being arrested for stealing 7,500 bucks. The game, though a little mean spirited, will be funny as shit. You guys are tough, you can handle it. This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. And I'm out. -_- Anyone who considers backing this project should watch this video by the project leader first: <url>’s see some more high rollers! Heck yes this looks awesome! I just hope the voices of the ponies will be more clearly recorded?? Art style is wonderful and girls have very nice voices and acting skills. You know, I've never been into MLP stuff, but the art style of those concept pictures look stylish as heck. I pledged just for that reason, there needs to be more interesting looking dating sims out there, rather than the typical 'blushing anime girl/boy' style! I must say, this looks both enticing and promising. So i'll throw $50 your way and anticipate it's release. Great work so far, and good luck! That was about the weirdest video I've ever seen, but I couldn't stop watching it. I guess that's the charm in psychoactive charm!
