8 INCH JUNKYARD GLASS BOWL VESSEL SINK MADE FROM JUNKYARD GLASS About us We are the Genettiâ€™s, a family with a dream of using our crafting skills to turn discarded tempered glass from junkyards into useful, profitable and eco-friendly products. We believe that creating beautiful, handmade objects can go hand in hand with a positive impact on the environment and our local communities. The beautiful vessel sink that we have created is our version of giving value to what is currently a waste material bound for landfills. The EPA estimates that we currently discard 12-15 million tons of non-recyclable glass annually. Our idea for "upcycling" this glass provides not only the possibility of making a variety of elegant artisanal products, but an ingenious way to practice sustainable manufacturing. This project could even stimulate an upcycling stream to boost our local economy. We have already engineered the basic process, are looking into local available light manufacturing spaces and, thanks to our wonderful supporters, we are already receiving donations of discarded tempered glass to help expand our project. We also have the opportunity to partner with major solar/wind generated electric suppliers. Why do we need the money? To make our dream become a reality, we need a larger workspace to store, wash and make our Junkyard Glass products. We will use your generous donations to secure a suitable space and construct a larger fusing oven. We also intend to provide payment for several people who are currently donating their time to see this project succeed. Link to Gary Genetti's Glass Website: <url>"JUNKYARD JEWELS". They are very excited to work more on this during Spring Break. We still have a big challenge to find the right marketing approach for such a diverse line of products, but ideas are bubbling up every day. First step is logo and website. One of our ideas is to use the number 75 in the logo as that's the number of generous backers we have to thank for giving us this opportunity to succeed! THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR YOUR GENEROSITY AND SUPPORT! STAY TUNED FOR A BIG SHOUT OUT FROM THE GENETTI FAMILY.

THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALL YOU HAVE DONE SO FAR. In response to a number of inquiries about the birdbath featured in the photo for our project, we are now offering it as a reward! For a pledge of $650 you will receive this wonderful piece of garden sculpture. It stands 3 feet high with an 18" diameter bowl and would make a wonderful centerpiece to any outdoor setting. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR SUPPORT! We're off to a great start. 15 backers and 22% funded on day two! We also made the "pick of the week" page on Kickstarter. Look what a neighbor donated for the project. Four crates packed solid with 30" X 30" sheets of tempered glass. We gotta use this stuff! You may use it for any food product. The glass is not reactive to any food. Thanks! received my bowl a couple days ago very nice... looks great on the library coffee table. I got my 8" bowl yesterday. Quick question: Can I use this bowl as a fruit bowl, for bananas, oranges, apples, pears? Will the tempered glass react with the fruit? Thanks I have a feeling you mean 18" in diameter. 18' would be huge. Looks beautiful. Good luck. David.
