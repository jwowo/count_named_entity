Your support is key. Whether it's a virtual high-five, a social media share or support at levels that include receiving your own pocket-friendly Fred Water Flask, we thank you for taking part in our mission of "more water, less sugar." All supporters who pledge at levels that include receiving a Fred Water Flask will get our Kickstarter Limited Edition Box Set: one food-grade brushed stainless steel (or color coated) Water Flask, one extra stainless steel cap, one loop lanyard (for those who prefer to carry Fred in their hand), and two sweet foil-stamp water-proof Fred stickers (all seen below). Note on Colors: Different desktop monitors and smart phones display color differently. To be exact, the colors of the Flasks will match the following Pantone colors: White, Black 7, Orange 804, Army Green 5763, Light Blue 278. Kickstarter Pledgers get extras... The white, charcoal, orange, army green, and light blue Flasks above have a matte finish with the highest quality color coat available on the market - specifically designed for coloring stainless steel and offering enhanced durability. Below is an image of the same stainless steel Fred Water Flask with one additional element - plated Gold. 14 Carat Gold on the outside. Just 6 left (as of December 21 @ 11:19 am PT USA). Below is an image of the spout with the cap off. The spout is made from 1.5mm thick food-grade stainless steel to ensure it's comfortable and not sharp. "We’ve had an appreciation for what Fred Water has been doing up to til now, but after this video appeal for their new steel water flask on Kickstarter we are bona fide fans." - Rad Collector "The majority of water bottles won’t fit in your pocket no matter what kind of pants you are wearing and if they do fit they will likely end up leaking all over the place. The people at Fred Water know this frustration all too well and have created a solution—the Fred Water Flask." - Inked Magazine Our product designers and production managers have worked tirelessly to get us to this point. We have the final samples approved and the manufacturer is ready to go. The next step is your participation; reaching our goal funds the product launch and gets one of the very first Fred Water Flasks into your hands (or pockets, actually). At Fred, we're passionate about the healthy role water can play in people's lives. When you drink more water and less sugar, good things happen. And since we like to make good things happen all the time, we created a way to keep water with you wherever you go: refillable Water Flasks. Fred Water makes drinking and carrying water stylish and effortless, and we’re always thinking of new ways to achieve our mission of "more water, less sugar." Our team is super fortunate to have amazing athletes, artists and thought-leaders embracing our mission and we're excited to grow our community to achieve an even greater impact in the world. We decided Kickstarter would be the ideal venue for opening a direct dialogue with the community, gaining valuable feedback and securing the funding necessary to manufacture the first batch of Fred Water Flasks. In exchange for your support, we're offering the first Flasks for significantly less than estimated retail value. It was sunny when we took the photo, so relax about the sunglasses.

We will be shipping them out, hopefully Wednesday. We are in touch with customs and we are awaiting clearance. You will be the first to know when we get them, going out same day they arrive. - A We are expecting the shipment of brushed steel water flasks by air any day now and we are ready to turn them around to you. Below are pictures of a UPS box that came today ahead of the shipment. Everyone has been amazing, we very much appreciate your patience while we work to get you the most pocket-friendly badass water bottle on the market. Images below show... A bunch of brushed steel. The fluorescent orange is dead on. The kickstarter green is dead on. The charcoal is dead on. The army green is super close but we are going to get it a tad darker. The marsala, which is going to get less orangy and more ruby-esque. Colors coming to us next, we have production staff going to China on Friday to personally approve the production run of colors at the factory. Hi all. Adam here. Welding issues solved, working on expediting production run shipping to the states to ship out. I will know more shortly. Please check here and comments as we can't handle each inbound question re ship date. Getting real close and psyched about the quality. Hi Backers! Hope your 2015 is getting off to a great start. So we are in full fledge production on the Water Flasks and have about 90% of the Survey Data in. It is important to fill them them out right away if you have not. If you are continuing to have errors when filling out the survey, try doing it at a different time of the day. We think server overload is the issue. We will be releasing ship dates soon. Also, if you have sent a message with a color change since you filled out the survey, know that we are sifting through each message and updating the final mail file. It is critical that you MESSAGE us WITHIN KICKSTARTER and clarify the color you chose in the survey AND then the corrected color you desire. Please say ARMY GREEN or KS GREEN (some of you are saying Green and we don't know which you mean). Please DO NOT use other forms of communication to change your color. The following will not work: Emailing us at FREDWATER.COM or using our SOCIAL MEDIA or posting a COMMENT on KS UPDATES or a COMMENT on KS COMMENTS). We WILL NOT be able to change your color if you use these methods. It is too confusing and we don't want to make errors. Thank you! - Adam Hey all. Note that if you changed your mind on color, we will try our best to update the data. No guarantees only because we're dealing with so much information and so many messages. But we will try. If you don't hear back on a message, continue to check the Comments section. Also, if you want additional flasks, visit fredwater.com Thanks for all your support! - A Pre-Order at FREDWATER.COM Thank you for all your support! - The Fred Team Just 300 Water Flask Pledges with 17 hours left to reach our stretch goal. Thanks so much for your support and thanks for sharing with friends and family during these final hours. - The Fred Team We are thrilled with the support and feedback from all of you! A leather sleeve is in development and many other comments are being considered for near future launches. As a $200k stretch goal before Project end (just 39 hours), we are opening up 2 new colors: Kickstarter Green (which btw is super close to Pantone's 2013 Emerald "Color of the Year") and Marsala (which is the 2015 Pantone "Color of the Year"). With 39 hours to go, reaching $200k is approximately 425 additional Water Flask Pledges (incremental to our expected rate without a push from you). With 1 in 10 current Pledgers driving 1 additional Water Flask Pledge, we will get there. Simply share our video with friends, family, colleagues, the dude next door, the grocery clerk, that long lost Uncle. Ok you get the point. Thanks so much. - Adam We are at 4,900 Fred Water Flasks pledged and counting. Thank you for your support! Production is underway (and updates will be provided as we get through each stage). Note that we have included Animated eCards for gifting Fred. It's basically a simulated gift unwrapping experience for Christmas Day. It's on our Kickstarter Page with instructions on how to use. Wishing you the happiest of Holidays! - The Fred Team Other cool Kickstarter Projects we support... FOLDIO. Be a professional photographer in a split second. Lighting is everything and the Foldio solves lighting everytime. <url>"Where is my flask?" the blanket answer is they are close to arriving. We know this is rough and we are making the right decisions to finalize this project. You backed us and we will make this all up to you not only through fulfilling our obligations. I will upload pictures of the passed bottles for those most skeptical. Very sincerely, Adam To our backers who have never worked in China: You have every right to think we are bad at what we do, incompetent, etc. But imagine telling your factory that the washer needs to be 2.7mm thick in order for the flasks to seal. Imagine receiving, 2 weeks late, thousands of washers that are all 1.5mm thick instead. Imagine ordering 500 of one color and 200 of another. Imagine receiving 700 of the first color and zero of the other. Imagine a culture where lying is considered good business and if you catch the lie then that earns you respect (rather than causing shame or embarrassment). This is not unique to Fred. We are waiting on the 2.7mm washers, promised to arrive in 1 week, and we can ship out the rest of the flasks. We are hiring a new team in china to manage this going forward. This team will be living at the factory every day. It will cost us a lot of money, but it is required. Please bare with us, it's down to 1.2mm in washer thickness - a piece of food grade silicone. - The Fred Team @adrien We are working on a solution packet for people with the leaking issue and for the scratch cap and sending out all together. We are waiting on this from the factory. Hello, We are attempting to satisfy everyone as fast as we can. Our campaign expenditures are completely unrelated to the amount of time and attention (and money) spent to completing this project and moving to a better manufacturing process going forward. Sending update now. Close to receiving balance of bottles. Some day we will tell you what it's like to work with factories in China. Issues noted in this comment are better to go in Messages. Either way, we are responding to each of you in comments because the issues noted are repetitive. If you have a problem, we do recommend you scroll down on comments because they are very likely addressed as well. Also, approx 2 weeks for rest of colors and orders to ship. - The Fred Team Please send issues to <email> and they will be handled. If your cap is leaking, it may require 2 washers. If that works, email us and we will send out a washer that is thicker. There are two reasons one would taste or smell steel. Dirt or high sensitivity to drinking water from steel. For those with this problem, we suggest filling the caps (without seal) and bottle in very hot water and a drop of dish soap and letting them sit for an hour. Be careful, the bottle will be very hot. Rinse really well with cold water. For the most part, it's getting used to drinking water out of steel. The quality of steel 18/8 is odorless. If anyone has an issue w their order email <email> with pictures. If your cap leaks, use two silicone washers. If your cap scrapes when turning on, try the cap with no washer. If it no longer scrapes, email us and we will send you replacement washers. Complaints here will not get addressed. Thank you. Rick. Response to your post below. Rick: Received my army green flask in the UK today. First impressions were great. The finish on the bottle is flawless but there's a fault with the thread on the bottle or on the supplied caps. With the green cap it's tricky to get the threads to engage. When you do, whilst everything appears fine as you start to screw it down, as you tighten it begins to sit unevenly on the bottle - not by much but enough to look bad. Fred Water: Yes, we have rejected many for this reason. The issue is with the spout or the ledge of the spout or the cap thread height or a combination of all three. If it is off by more than 1.5 mm on one side, we tried different caps. Of course, some can slip through. Please let us know. Rick: Tried the brushed steel spare cap to see if it did the same. It doesn't as the steel cap seems to be a different size on the inside and goes virtually all the way on without engaging the thread - only needs a quarter turn to tighten when the thread engages. Does it leak? No, not with either cap on but getting the cap on is fiddly and the fit of the green cap bugs me as it's not straight. It's just a few millimetres but it takes the edge off an otherwise fabulous looking bottle. Fred Water: If it's a few millimeters, send us a pic please. Also, on the cap that only engages a bit, did you receive extra washers? There are thinner washers for that issue, if it leaks. As noted, these bottles are hand made. Quality and speed are not friends. We have standards for what passes and fails so if you think you have a serious issue, please let us know via messages. - The Fred Team Duane et al. Yes, we are responding to people with questions about their flask. In terms of the status of the balance of bottles, we have not had information that could get you closer to knowing the timing. The predictability of this project is very poor as a result of the amount of hours required to make our bottle by hand oversees. Clearly, it goes without saying, the factory over promised. We are controlling the elements that we can control and attempting to minimize the areas we cannot control as best as possible. But this combination costs us on speed. We are refusing bottles with quality issues and then new bottles need to be produced to replace those bottles. Shipping by air, which saves approximately 30 days, is very expensive. We have been doing it and will continue to do it. An update is going out today with a stated 'ship out to you' goal on the balance of the bottles (orders that include white, kickstarter green, light blue, orange or marsala). 3 weeks from now is the stated goal (based on the information we have now). We appreciate your support! - The Fred Team Jess. Place the large loop around the bottle (small loop for your finger). It works better this way. In terms of the small loop around the spout, the lack of consistency of space below the cap causes some to leak. So we made the alternative option, which works well. - The Fred Team @erictoe for some people, the steel has a taste. Try dropping a lemon slice in for a day, helps a lot. It's not an issue w the material we use, it just takes getting used to for some. Note: With many flasks arriving, Message volume has ramped up. We will get caught up over the next 3 days. Bethany, send a pic. It is extremely unlikely to be rust, more likely discoloration. Please send pic to <email> Theo, It is easy to make simple comments about using updates more, which we have used them alot, and comments and especially messages. We have 4700 people across 65 countries and 7000 flasks which can be a combination of 81 different variations of colors. Updates is insufficient for communicating a single person's status given the delays. Eric. There is no glue anywhere on the bottle. Just food grade steel. Email data was not transferred to many from ncoa data cleanup and so many will not receive an email but we do have all the tracking numbers. Please message, we can't respond in comments effectively. 1. If no seal in cap or in box, that is an error. Message us. 2. To clean, we reco a dab of dish soap and hot water then lemon and hot water. Also BOTTLE BRIGHT on Amazon. 3. Loop Lanyard usage. Place large loop around bottle, small loop is for your finger. The other way doesn't really work because we ended up removing some space under the cap due to design issues. @kyle, Message us and we will replace. Patrick Scherer, Message is w the issue. Sorry that happened. 7000 flasks, 14,000 caps. Shluld not have slipped through. Jess, to be fair, correction. You did update in the survey and the staff did not update the fulfillment file. Alot of data moving around. New flask sent to VA today. Apologies. Jess. Be fair. You did not follow our message to you. Messaged to you... "We are requesting that all addresses be entered into the survey. Mainly, so we don't make errors transferring the info into it. Also because we cannot keep up with demand on address changes." @FredMcFarland With all due respect, you told us that you were complaining to Amazon and handling it with them. This was over concern of the shade of the Army Green color, which we clarified for you. It looks awsm and it's precise to official Army Green. It is arriving to you via FedEx tracking no 624361000471 Brushed/Steel/Charcoal Orders (not including other colors). All US are in the FedEx Ground system. Some of you should already have them. Be worried in another few business days and contact us via Messages. All INT'L feeding out country by country and almost completely completed. USPS. Tracking numbers will hit your inbox if INT'L. @Wolli.Wood. Our 'messages' inbox is 100% answered. With 4600 people, that's the place to get the answers you need. If an individual wants to know the status of their flask, simply message us. Thank you. All flasks are shipping out or have been shipped out. If you have not received the email and you are outside the US, you will any day. We are pouring through each and every address to make sure it looks correct. Unfortunately, in many countries, we cannot verify and if it looks at all strange, we are messaging you to confirm it is correct. Some provided their address NOT in english and our system does not recognize non-english letters or symbols. With the exception of a very few, all are out or will be out within days. This is for the brushed, charcoal and/or army green. Update on the other colors shortly. - The Fred Team @danobrien This is a bit much. The campaign ended on Dec. 31 and was orig. promised to ship some time in Jan. Not in time for Christmas. Note: US Customers of the charcoal, brushed and army pledges will not get an email because we ended up using FedEx Ground in the US instead through a faster fulfillment house. They should all arrive in the next 4 to 5 business days in the US. All charcoal, brushed and army green bottles are sending out now, if another color was not included in the pledge. The rest will be shipping soon. - The Fred Team We are shipping out. IF you have a change of address as of today or this week, please MESSAGE (don't COMMENT), MESSAGE your new address to us immediately. Thank you! - The Fred Team Hey all. 2,443 addresses include only the steel, charcoal and army green flasks. Those are mailing out Wednesday. The balance are en route to the states. Some delays with qc. We are sending out a message to the 2,443 letting them know via bulk email and sending another email out to the rest with the timing for their shipments. - The Fred Team People have asked a couple questions that we want to clarify. A. Someone asked about coatings on the inside. The natural chromium oxide layer that forms over stainless steel is what keeps it food safe. We have made sure that the weld material is high food-grade stainless (high chromium %, which is what you want for that protective layer). B. This 120 day delay (orig estimate was end of January) was the result of 3 things. 1. It is really hard to make our bottle. I know people are making funny comments about how easy and simple it is. Some do not recognize the difference between soft aluminum and hard stainless steel. Steel is forever safe, but much harder. The stamping of the bottles (and retaining the alignment of the two sides so they line up) was a process to get right. When they are off, they had to use too much weld and we rejected those. You see, round bottles are easy because they are purchased in already-made tubes and then the bottom and top are welded on. Our bottles are stamped. 2. Communication with our factory has been a real challenge. We believe in only dealing with the top person when it comes to projects like this and so we are dealing with the owner. But it requires translators. He is a good guy and he is trying like heck. But we have been rejecting bottles and so they had to slow down their process to keep quality to our standards. The original estimates on speed of production were way off, but appeared reasonable when originally estimated. So every night, we talk with the owner. And we have visited on numerous occasions. A day is a week over there when it comes to making any changes to our bottle. It requires changing the parts that make the parts. These parts are hardened steel and altering them is not a fast process. It took 30 days to make our mold, 24 hours a day, as an example. That was completed on time and that is why we estimated end of Jan for shipping. Of course, we had many samples that passed. But that was because they only made a dozen or two dozen. Not thousands. Thanks to your support, we had to order 7,000 flasks. 3. We have 4500 people (across 60+ countries) and each, reasonably, wants their flask now. Because of the complexity of 8 colors and pledges that include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9 flasks (mixed and matched across colors), in trying to send out passed brushed flasks, we created confusion because the back numbers are all over the place. Backer number 3,000 might have ordered just 1 brushed flask or backer number 3,000 might have ordered 1 of each color. We want to get everyone their flask and trying to communicate with each person is taking a lot of time. Each of you are worth the time, but we receive everything from "Good luck getting through this. I understand. My job includes manufacturing in Asia." to "You are lame. You don't know what you are doing. This should be so easy." We can take it all, but in the meanwhile we are simply focused on completing this and getting you flasks we are proud of. The factory has the final flasks completed and they are packing them up. As soon as they are in the air, we will have 100% predictability. Before they are in the air, we do not. Not because we are lame, but because communication is challenged and things that make sense to us don't play out as one would expect. This is the reason for not putting up another Update to all. Note: 99% of all steel bottles are made in Asia. Because of how labor intensive they are to make. Finally, we appreciate those who understand that Kickstarter is not a store. It's a community of people backing business ideas. We are 120 days late, and we hate that. But you backed us and we have a great product that took longer and it is in fact getting sent out to you. And from there, we will continue to get better and our business will succeed. Thanks to you. You got us here. - Adam and Ariel (co-founders) All of the final flasks are shipping to us in days. The day they do, we will have exact dates of shipping out. - The Fred Team Every single person is getting their flask. Final set of flasks preparing to ship to Fred to immed go out. George, looking into. The status for some countries says that even though it is sent. Every single person is getting their flask. Final set of flasks preparing to ship to Fred to immed go out. All of the brushed steel, charcoal, army green are heading to us by air to be immed shipped out. They were QAed and boxed there. We will notify when they clear customs. All of the other colors are a week and a half behind those. If anyone reading this has dealt with chinese manufacturing on a first major run of a product, you will understand. Thank you for your patience and feel free to message w any other questions. Rod, We held the factory to a high standard and this caused delays. We are through it now and they are shipping to the states to immed send out. I assure you this has been more painful for our company than you can imagine. But you will have your flask shortly and we are happy with the final outcome. - A I would describe this project as incredibly painful but worth it in the end. I would also describe the project as whack-a-mole. We solve one issue, another pops up. We solve that, then another. Through the process, bottles are making their way to PASS and we're shipping them out. A high number made it through and are heading our way. So, the pass rate is increasing. The mole is popping up less and less. Clearly, this is unacceptable. But we have no choice at this time. We must power through and we very much appreciate your patience and understand your frustration. - A @Jared and all. All of the rest of the Steel, Charcoal and Army Green have passed the 11 point inspection and they are being air flown to us in the states to immediately send out with a fast fulfillment house. The rest of the colors are supposed to get on a plane to us next week and we are on top of doing everything we can to make that happen. I am cautiously optimistic about next week versus the following week because of how unpredictable everything has been. For those not following, we were rejecting a bunch for issues. @Jeff You ordered color flasks. Please read the update. Best. - A @linda We did not collect the payment through paypal. So we need to just pay you, which is why we need your email. Thanks much. - A @melissa You are in the queue but your backer number is on the high end. Should not be too much longer. - A The surveys are left open for change of address. When we give delivery dates on them you can determine if you need to change the survey which is a click away on our project page. Logged in, go to your pledge and click on it. Undergoing color qa to ensure high satisfaction. Will have results of those on Tuesday/Wednesday. Will update then. Didn't say we jumbled up the numbers. Backers who ordered 1 brushed only were sent first (because colors are not ready to be sent) and the backer numbers are not sequential. Backer 3 might have ordered a brushed but backer 4 could have ordered orange. @jeremy spray Gotta admit. Nice to hear! @taylor you will not be disappointed. @xiao We were not able to do and let you know that. Some have their idea about how to handle their order differently. Times 4,500+ people times 6,800 flasks times 13,600 caps and 13,600 washers and 13,600 stickers and 6,800 lanyards, 4,500+ boxes, 4,500+ shipping labels after performing a 10 point qa check on 6,800 bottles and 13,600 caps. We are not able to make changes that would seem simple to a single person, it will cause us to make errors. @ken Not ignoring. Will go through tomorrow. Accounting handled. @frank We have been using the Fred flask and testing it against other stainless steel water bottles. Zero difference. Have you used stainless steel bottles before? @dave We started shipping International day 1. @annmariepfohl When we made the labels within pledges for brushed steel bottles only, the label making program mixed up the order of the backers and so some did receive bottles out of order. We cannot guarantee exact accuracy but we are trying. - A Wash your stainless steel water bottle thoroughly with water, some mild soap, plus 1 teaspoon of baking soda. In the end, there is zero leaching into your water and it's the smell you might not be used to. But in a day or two, you will not notice it any longer. @rayraysayhey place the cap, washer separate, bottle in the dishwasher bottom rack. That will do it. We will be sending out an email to the balance of people who will be getting bottles from final chinese shipment w timing. We are undergoing an intense qa at the factory now, packing orders in individual boxes there for shipment to all at the same time when they arrive here. Labels for all are awaiting them. - A @thesanfrancisco et al If using the lanyard, use both washers in the one cap (rounded edge of washers facing up). Wash spout facing down in bottom dishwasher and place cap and washer separately in silverware holder to wash. @thadeus message us and we will send you a couple new caps and washers. - A If you want to know, message us with the name on the "ship to" and we can look it up. Sometimes different names are used as kickstarter usernames - making it difficult. Color are not ready to ship so if you are an early backer and you ordered a color, you will not yet have it. Make sense? They all stand up. Some of them rock a little. Obviously, we can do better. But they do stand. - A The bottom needs to be a separate section so it can be molded with an indentation and we tried that but then we had yet another weld inside and the tolerances made it hard to match up (at the thickness of our bottle, which is already thicker than other bottles). We think we have a solution but it will require r&d. Which we are beginning. China. On our 3rd qa firm. They are made by hand and I think they are really nice. Improvements to be made in the manufacturing process? Yes. Robert amd others w a change of address, please update the survey. Login, click on your pledge and change your address in the survey. Thank you. We should be up to 4000 from 1000 soon but we are performing very strict qa and will have more info very shortly. First, it is weld which is food safe. We have increased our attention to the problem w qa and if you have this issue we will send you a new one or provide a refund w a picture of the weld. It must be a bubble. Message us with your desire. All, a Great product for cleaning your bottle is "bottle bright" tabs avail. on amazon. Makes cleaning super easy. They were on Shark Tank and they are grt guys. - A Chad, Because the bottle is not round, you will find imperfections as much of the bottle is made by hand. Round tubes are far simpler. In terms of something rough near the inside of the bottle, that is safe and expected based on the current process which will not change for this run. A bump of slag is not acceptable. Please advise which you have. - A Giulio, First production pain, not amateur. - A These have been QAd out. Missed these w weld. Will send replacement. Message changes of address pls. Sf, While safe, we will replace those. They got past qa. Will send out. Sf, While safe, we will replace those. They got past qa. Will send out. Sf, While safe, we will replace those. They got past qa. Will send out. Sf, While safe, we will replace those. They got past qa. Will send out. Toladib, Are you talking about something that feels like a bump? - A Toladib, Are you talking about something that feels like a bump? - A We are fast and furiously sending out brushed. Color coated shipping out next week. We ran into qc issues and spent a lot of time removing them which slowed us down. Will send new update in the next 24 hours. If you get yours, please let us know. Dave et al The Flasks look good but we decided to qa each one stateside and found caps w the laser etching off center. We made process improvements at the factory and removed those and will begin sending today. Painting for color is late, starting tomorrow shipping to us end of week (w cap laser center improvement in place). Please know that this has been way more difficult than anticipated but we are getting there, working around the clock. We appreciate positive comments and your oatience a ton! Thanks!! Brushed flasks are here! Shifts of people packing, as of this morning, every day all day, two 8 hour shifts a day. Starting w backer #1, will send emails to each person as their package hits the post office which will be daily. Color flasks heading this way shortly to join brushed in this fulfillment frenzy. I understand the frustration everyone. We are super close to hydration in your pocket. All, when you send a change of address or color change in messages, we got it. We are getting hundreds if not more messages from people wanting to converse back and forth and it's not possible to pull resources away to converse. Please don't take as rude. Updates and comments are where to get info. Fred is in customs at sfo, should arrive tomorrow at our office but could be Wed. We are doing everything we can, that I promise. - A Sf, what direct message? Did not receive. Hi all. We are waiting for them to arrive, any day, in transit. The minute they arrive, we will send out and notify you that they were sent. - A @Theo I will publish order dates as they get sent out. Hey all, first 50% of the flasks are heading to CA by air. We spent 2 extra days on QA. See Update schedule for details. We will show pics of them getting packed for delivery to you. Earliest receive first regardless of country. More to come. Jaymes, The color coatings are rated to be durable at well over boiling. Jaymes and Daniel. Pictures sometimes don't show well, but yes, the brushed caps are mirror finish on the top with our Fred badge laser etched into the cap. On the durability of the paint, we are using the best paint available, however as you can imagine, paint on metal is going to scratch if you take a key to it or drop it on pavement. Skippy, there is a great product called Bottle Bright (effervescent tablets) on Amazon. We are using them and they work great. Hello. I did say that I would post an update and it took longer. We were working out a schedules. Apologies. We are project managers as well and we are being careful to make sure this product is perfect and the chinese new year means not all of the staff are working though we do have some working. I promise to send a schedule and rather than have approval delays, we are traveling back to handle approvals ourselves. This is our first run and small things are coming up and we are not willing to compromise. Thank you. @Dono Boyer III and @Soltyk The cap is identical to what you orig saw and what is on our project page. The cap is flush to the bottle. It is double walled which is why you see some w the outter shell. I will be posting an update tonight. If anyone has a change of address, you can do so right in the survey - it is editable. Or you can message it to us. Hey all. In the survey, you can update the address. See KS instructions here: How can I view or change my survey responses?

The factory delays have to do with small unforseen issues requiring improvements. Welding speed, sandblasing w a smaller spout. They have been solved and the quality is very high. I will post pictures in the morning. 2. Parts are all stamped and welding and sandblasting is well under way. Also, they are committed and in fact many of the staff are working into the holiday. Not stopping. I will post pictures and begin to release mailing schedules. Thank you for your patience. - Adam Hi all. Adam here. Welding issues solved, working on expediting production run shipping to the states to ship out. I will know more shortly. Please check here and updates as we can't handle each inbound question re ship date. Getting real close and psyched about the quality. Hi all. Adam here. Welding issues solved, working on expediting production run shipping to the states to ship out. I will know more shortly. Please check here and updates as we can't handle each inbound question re ship date. Getting real close and psyched about the quality. Read the Update. Yes, we will send out based on those in line first. - Adam To all of our supporters. We are getting a lot of complaints that the KS Green and Marsala were released after the survey went out and some want one of those colors (when they thought they did not) OR some DO NOT want one of those colors (when they thought they would). We were not able to release the two colors before the survey went out because we didn't have the images. If you are unhappy, please message us with the correct color - the color you want. We will sift through the messages and update your survey. Please do not message us and ask if you can or complain, it's better to just message us with what you want. BUT, please be clear because there are 2 greens. ARMY GREEN and KS GREEN. Please specify. Thank you! - Adam Check updates for production and general responses to your questions, including questions in messages you send us. - A t-miyajima, Please try again. Ruth, Yes. - A Jack, the two new colors will be up shortly. - A Ruderis and everyone else filling out the survey. I had the same issue when pledging for other Projects and filling out the survey. Resulted in '404 Not Found.' The good news is we are receiving the data from the 2 people who have experienced this with our Survey. Ruderis, we have your info! - Adam Use this link <url>… <url>傅明軒, Sammy, Karma on shipping, Unfortunately, we go through a number of processes in the US before shipping out. Sorry :( Nathanael, We need all of the color flask pledges to be color flasks for color minimum reasons in production. If we made an exception, which seems perfectly reasonable, it would be unfair to others who asked the same question. If you really want a steel, make the $23 pledge and let the color pledge go - it will get swiped up by someone else. Wish I could help more. - Adam Connor and others asking about the leather sleeve. We are fast at work on the design and design considerations of the leather sleeve. This will become available on our site as soon as we can get it launched. Mathias, Yes, do that and add $4 if going to the US or 8 if going International. Skippy. All of this has been avoided for three reasons. 1. Very experienced production managers who work exclusively with Chinese manufacturers with feet on the ground and nightly conference calls. 2. Personal on site visits and alot of time spent prototyping with the manufacturer in China before launching Kickstarter. 3. Very detailed and professional project management function in place at Fred. We have produced and sold this same brand/shape in another material (live in market across the US). We leave no stone unturned. You are right that this requires a lot of expertise. We are on top of it. Best. - Adam Jack We are underway with production now starting with the first pledges first. We will send out a survey the day after the Project ends and provide updates on shipping / timing depending on the time of your pledge. Jeremy C. It costs $1 more for colors. Benjamin We are always looking to innovate. Great suggestion! On your question about heat, there is no technology. It gets hot. The original design is made for water, not hot water. Though Stainless Steel is safe for all liquids and we will be innovating a sleeve that greatly slows heat transfer. P.H. We are underway with production. We noted 8 weeks in our Q&A. We will provide more certain timing upon sending out the survey and grouping pledges - first come first serve. Akeel The leather sleeve option has to go through many phases of design, prototyping. We have many considerations including additional materials that provide different properties. But we are working on it. Julian, I checked with our social media person and you received a response. - Adam Brad - We are working on the viability of the Kickstarter Green. The minimums might be high, working on it. - Adam P.H. So far we are looking good on timing. - Adam BaSILB and Jeremy, It costs much more than an extra $1.00. The bottles and caps have to be transported to another facility, coated, then go get the laser engraving (whereas the brushed can skip this process) then get handled differently at every step of the process to make sure each person receives the proper color. Hope this helps. - Adam Hi Charlotte. Thank you for the love. Back atcha! It is dishwasher safe. Happy Hydrolidays! - A Zach - at the end of the Project you will receive a survey asking you which color. Eldar - Food-grade stainless steel can hold alcohol safely. - A Hi Carol. The quality and workmanship of our bottle is off the charts high. - Adam Stretch Goal: We are strongly considering offering a stretch goal for the Kickstarter Green color. Any takers? Our bottles are manufactured in South Mainland China at a factory that we have personally visited. We have a strong daily working relationship with the owners and we are very pleased with the working conditions, expertise and the quality. Bhurut, We are using a product for the coating that has been tested extensively on stainless steel and the results of the tests tell us that this is THE best coating on the market today. It is the same coating found on the outside of the highest quality stainless steel pots and pans. - Adam Hi Alan, Yes, the stainless is right in between the 20oz and the 13oz plastic flasks. It is smaller. - Adam Good news. The colors are up and we have solved the Pantone color matching problem. The Flasks will now be color coated with an extremely durable paint made specifically for stainless steel AND the colors will match to our Pantone color desires precisely. Also, the coating is even more durable than the Powder Coat method and the matte finish looks even better (zero 'orange peel' - google if you don't know the term). We are super pumped! We have struck a balance between strength and weight, it feels really good in your hands and pocket (filled). jennifer, the brushed steel is just straight steel. The colors are powder coat colors. - Adam Hi Natalie. Great care has gone into every detail of our design. I just uploaded a picture of the spout (seen on the bottom of the PHOTOS Section of the Kickstarter Project Page). We used thicker food-grade stainless steel (compared to the bottle) to make sure drinking from the Water Flask would be comfortable and not at all sharp. Before thickening the steel, we considered rolling it. But we were concerned that doing this would cause issues with cleaning the spout, so we decided to avoid hard-to-clean spaces and widened the spout instead. Hope this helps. - Adam Oops, Typo: "look lanyard" should have been "loop lanyard." Hi everyone. A few responses to the below questions in one Comment post here: 1. Leather case. Looking into this but we do want to consider coverings that provide more insulation properties (perhaps). This is not to say we are not also considering Leather. 2. The look lanyard you see on our project page loops around the threads and the cap then screws over the top of it. Pretty simple, and effective. 3. The gauge is thick, you can barely feel it move when you really try to squeeze it front-to-back. Barely. 4. Production is beginning! 5. Due to color minimums, if you want a brushed steel water flask, manage up your Pledge to the level that says "brushed steel" available. 6. Julian, on FREDWATER.COM, click contact us (provide your zip code) and the team can send you back stores in your area for the PET Clear Plastic Water Flasks. A store finder is launching on our site soon as well. Thanks everyone! - A Alan, yes. That is the black color. - A Specs image getting updated w weight and dimensions. - Adam Will let everyone know when photos of colors are up. Matching pantone chip is taking a bit. - A Blake, you will receive a survey at the end of the Project where you will have an opportunity to choose your color. - Adam Mike, the mouth is approx. 30mm. - Adam Alan, shipping in Jan. Yes. - Adam Thanks for the feedback! - Adam Kenny and Nixolus, Though not the initial intended us, we are working on sleeves that insulate for hot liquids. - Adam Hi. 1. 2 is at the $48 pledge level. KS only allows 1 pledge. 2. Yes, sharing on your social channels is super appreciated. And the video is fun to share. 3. Water will stay cool in the flask. Hi Alex. It is a screw on cap, so as long as you tighten it, it will not leak. The cap's silicone gasket presses against the spout for a reliable seal. Hope this helps. - Adam Hi David. Food grade stainless steel will not leave a taste, that's the beauty of it. And how safe it is. - Adam 1. Color pics coming soon. 2. Will look into heat tint Lars. Great idea and truly a unique one. 3. Matt. Thanks for the complement on our vid! 4. On green, we have an Army Green. In terms of a KS green, not out of the question. - Adam The Team at Fred is humbled by the support we have received thus far. We're halfway to our goal and just a few days in. Thank you does not even begin to characterize how we're feeling. As Rhys would say "Sell the Papers!" We can't wait to get you one of our Fred Water Flasks! - Adam and Team Yes, it will. Hope this helps as long as you tighten it down. Of course, be careful if you change altitude. :) actually :( - Adam We can hit that Pantone color! It's a great idea. All ideas are going into a bucket to review weekly. This one made it in there, didn't bounce off the rim and miss. :) - Adam Hi Elle, Color choices will be at the end of the project when we send out a survey asking you to choose. And we will have studio shots on our site by then so you can make a confident choice. Hope this helps. - Adam Hi Matt, we will definitely have nice studio shots of all colors so people can feel confident about their choice. Yes, limited edition colors are a good idea. Trying to keep it simple at first (simple like Fred), but we will definitely have many cool things in store over time. Thanks so much for your complements. Always give us feedback, good or bad. It makes us better. - Adam Brad, they are identical except for the color. - Adam Yes, they are powder coated - for durability. I'm not even dressed like a scientist, but we are using this technology to color our Flasks: Says WIKI... "Powder coating is a type of coating that is applied as a free-flowing, dry powder. The main difference between a conventional liquid paint and a powder coating is that the powder coating does not require a solvent to keep the binder and filler parts in a liquid suspension form. The coating is typically applied electrostatically and is then cured under heat to allow it to flow and form a "skin". The powder may be a thermoplastic or a thermoset polymer. It is usually used to create a hard finish that is tougher than conventional paint. Powder coating is mainly used for coating of metals, such as household appliances, aluminium extrusions, drum hardware, and automobile and bicycle parts." International has now been opened to all Water Flask quantities. We did not anticipate the kind of demand Internationally (which we are psyched about) and so we want to serve that community with more offerings. If anyone ordered 4 when they wanted 2, they can go in and change their pledge to 2. Sorry for the confusion. We are looking into offering 2 and 8 for International. The reason we did not to start is because shipping at those sizes makes the per-unit shipping cost unusually high. 4 is the best rate on a per unit basis. But with your desire for 2, we will get back to you right away and may just open it up. Will be in touch. - Adam Correction on latest comment: "strong, but NOT heavy." Typo. Sorry. - Adam Hi Irawin. On the Stainless Fred Water Flasks, we went for a hefty but not too heavy weight. So it's strong, but heavy. The recyclable plastic versions are available online at fredwater.com Thanks! - Adam A question was asked about the Cap. It is 100% stainless steel, including the thread. With a food-grade silicon gasket under the cap to prevent leaking. - Adam The best thing about Kickstarter is getting feedback like this. We are taking all feedback and working through the process of identifying priorities for implementing new ideas. We will keep you posted as we progress. Thank you!!! - Adam We have tested the Fred flask and the differential between the temperature outside and the temperature in the bottle does cause sweating as you would expect. But it's not enough to cause any real issues. If you really get it cold with ice, it sweats more as you would expect. We do include the Loop Lanyard for these times. Also, R&D does have sleeves in development as a next step, but not for this Kickstarter timeline. Best. - Adam Yes, it is safe to use hot water but note that the bottle will get hot. It is not insulated. Pledges for single Fred Water Flasks are either stainless or choice of powder coat color. Pledges for multiple Fred Water Flasks allow you to mix and match between stainless and powder coat color. For anyone who chooses a color, we will send a survey at the end asking which color you would like to receive. Images of the White, Charcoal, Army Green, Orange and Light Blue will be uploaded and we will post an update when they are up. Note that they match the color chips shown on our page. Does this help? Best. - Adam Hi P.H At the end of the project, we will send out a survey. It may offer the stainless steel version to those who chose powder color coat. But we will not know until the end of the project, based on minimums of each color, etc. So if you want to be sure, you should pledge at the stainless level. If you want to gamble, choose the $19 pledge level. - Adam Hi all. First, thanks for your support. A few are asking about pledging for 2 or more Fred Water Flasks. If you scroll down, there are 2, 4 and 8 qty. options. 1 and 4 are setup for International, 2 and 8 are domestic only. For any multiple orders, we will survey you at the end of the funding to ask which colors you want. Does this help? Best. - Adam <url>"contact us" button and have linked it above. Maybe if 4500 people fill that contact box up they will reply. What do you have to loose, they already took our money. Cheers! this project is a big joke. a simple water bottle that cannot be fulfilled. never received, you can take my money as charity scamming scums. I never received my flasks. Any update? I invoke my rights under Kickstarters Terms of Use: https:www.kickstarter.com/terms-of-use/octz012 "Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fufill." I demand a full refund for my pledge amount. I invoke my rights under Kickstarter's Terms of Use: <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill." I demand an immediate full refund for my pledge amount. If you are in the states contact your local law enforcement and postal inspector. I still have not received my bottle. Did you ship at all? 4/10/ 2018 NEVER RECEIVED MY FLASK, SENT MULTIPLE EMAILS, NOTHING!!!! STILL HOPING HERE. 05 Feb 2018. Still have not received the flasks or a refund. Shit...at this point just send me three cases of your plastic bottles you sell on your website and we can call it even. <url>#.WnkwEmaZPLY I know that some backers received their flasks. I was one of them, but mine got stolen. If you find yours sitting in shelf please consider selling it to me. I will pay double the pledge price plus shipping. You can contact me on facebook - Kristaps Boris I pledged $70 for two flasks. Where are my flasks? To date, and after writing to you a few time, I received nothing. Not even a reply or response. Please revert. Tks. Hey! I still got nothing! What do I do? Who do I complain to? Australia here - we have nothing also :((( Sorry to the people that never got theres. The creators here did a real shit job of of this campaign. That being said my partner and I love out Fred water flasks. I have used mine for years now! Still holds up and looks great! Anything ? Anyone ? What a joke... Still received nothing in Paris... nyc here, got my flask on first run shipment, works great, no leaks, super happy wit my fred! Yo! Adam. WTF. I really only ever sponsored this to support a family venture. I don't care if you send me your failed flasks or my money back...just do something...say something...man up. I've given this project more than two years of good faith. Now I just want you to fail (seems likely). Before you do...perhaps you could make good on my "investment". I never ever record my order!!! Any updates? Still waiting for my flasks in France and wondering if this is a scam Singapore backer here, Anyone else hasn't gotten their flasks. They're totally unresponsive Are you ever going to give us the courtesy of a response? IT HAS BEEN TWO YEARS! WHERE IS MY FLASKS!!!! :((((( My son, Fred, is the reason I ordered this product. As part of the deal I refused to let him drink until his flask arrived. Its been 2 years now and he's looking rather worse for wear. Would you guys make haste and send me the f**king flask sharpish. Will the missing flasks ever be delivered? I noticed that on fredwater.com the steel flasks are not listed anymore. I am just curious because I have ordered 4 flasks and did not get anything... neither flasks nor a refund. After trying to use for long time the flask, I can state that a steel flavour is always within the water. Every time I drink water from the flask I get a steel flavour. I´m very dissapointed about this product. @david. Social media (twitter, YouTube clips) Still no rewards, refunds, or response from the FRED team....WTF?! this is frankly unacceptable and unfair to everyone who put their faith and money into the false product! If I do not receive any response I will be filing legal proceeding. I did as @Bethany said. Sent a mail to <email>. They answered and sent my two flasks the same day. Got them today. Got a black instead of a orange but i am completely happy with the flasks. Never thought i would get them at all, so i am happy! Please send me my 4 pack I backed. I'm thirsty and need to wet my whistle badly. Contact me please I spent my last few bits on this and really need this to come threw or its off to circus I go Hey! Completely forgot about this thing. Looks like these people are seriously behind the schedule. Should we - all who haven't received anything yet - report this project to Kickstarter? Today my flash arrived, a different color than originally ordered - but that is what we agreed on through messaging via the kickstarter messaging system, there was no lanyard, but I probably would never have used it in the first place... so let's see how leakproof it is... so for everybody who hasn't got a flask, contact them if you really want one... Those that haven't received their flasks, I would try emailing this address, that was who I was in contact with when I had lid sealing issues with the flask I received, they were helpful through the process. This was back in July though. <email> Sent a message back in December 2015 still haven't gotten a response. Flasks that were received don't properly seal with the lids. Would like to hear from them. Australia checking in, still no flask.. It's been a while. An update would be nice Update on this. I last posted on October 6th. Since then I was contacted on November 2nd to confirm my address and then on November 3rd received a notification that a replacement had been dispatched. I have received it today. A huge improvement, as other user has commented the thread is a lot better to screw the cap on, there is a little gap that shows but it has not leaked and I've shaken it about a bit to test. It's been a long time coming but finally have the flask promised I suspect everyone that got shortchanged in this is going to et there flask soon. I received my orginal and LONG time ago but recently got the second one I ordered. They've simplified the colors to just stainless and charcoal but I can tell you first hand the new one compared to my orginal is like night and day. The threads are a HUGE improvement on the new ones and overall there better made. I truly do feel bad for anyone that got kinds screwed in this system. If anyone wants a lanyard I'll send them mine from my orginal order. Ive never used it. PAY the shipping and it's yours. Still no flasks delivered. does contacting kickstarter themselves any more helpful? Hey fred. Just looking for a rough time frame for when I might receive my flasks here is Australia. It's been nearly 2years since my I backed you guys. Thanks rewards , refund or reply.!!! Greetings Fred, Just received my bottle, but I'm disappointed as you sent me the normal steel color way and not the blue bottle that i initially backed for 2 years ago. Also, there is no loop lanyard, no stickers, just an additional cap. Seriously, do i deserve to wait 2 years just to be shortchanged by you guys? I received my flask last year, looked and felt great. Unfortunately the cap didn't sit even, so there was some leakage if shaken about. I did email and tweet the creators, but never received a response to rectify the issue. If it wasn't for the cap, I'd have been happy with it Are people still getting these in the mail? Why doesnt the creator update us with status? Still haven't received my flask. It's been 2 years. I have to say that I really use mine daily and would like to see them make a titanium version to reduce weight. The shape is just perfect. Received a second tracking number... 3 weeks later and the status says Post Office has not received the package.. Its been years... What is happening with this? Still waiting for a reply... Still waiting... Hey there... So, I know JUST received my FRED Flasks here in Hong Kong...which I appreciated and they look really nice...BUT... If you looked at my Survey that I filled out, after your requested this on 2nd January 2015, I ordered BRUSHED STEEL, CHARCOAL, ORANGE and LIGHT BLUE. Now what I received is TWO x BLACK and TWO x BRUSHED STEEL...?!? I like to received what I pledged please so can you let me know how we can arrange this ASAP? Thanks and best regards, Rene PS. Also no loop lanyard in any of the 4 boxes received... I received the updated flasks yesterday and they're nice. The caps screw on just fine, it sits correctly on a flat surface, and theres no metallic taste! Good work. Thank you Received mine a while back. I used them a lot the first month but couldn't get rid of the metallic taste. Left some water in one for a couple of weeks only for it to rust... Disappointed to say the least - it was a cool idea that never really came to fruition presumably due to poor management Nothing here in Austria... Still havnt got my flasks I still haven't received mine. Any ETA for New Jersey? Me too, Fred Water flasks are unique and I am very pleased with their aesthetics and durability! I use mine since one year, it's great ! � Received a tracking number in March... still nothing. Tracking number says the post office never got the package... a response from Fred water would be nice... Still waiting over here in Australia, have moved house and contacted you guys but heard nothing. Not good. Still have not received mine, waiting on 2 flasks. I am still waiting Please at least contact me and let me know? there certainly can not be that manny left that have not received any thing yet, Should this not be your priority?? Finally received my three Flasks. Thank you. Where is my replacement cap? It never came Man I feel bad for how this campaign has gone down. I got my flask in Canada well over a year ago, no leaks not problems. It's well used now. I did make the mistake of immediately pre ordering 2 more right after mine arrived. Might never see those. Hope everyone does get there flasks eventually! @lucy Kupnicki - I received mine in Canada last winter. I can't believe this campaign hasn't been completed for everyone by now Still waiting for mine in Canada.. i hear some folks got there's finally in canada.. This is comical. Fred actually messaged me last month about my leaking flask I posted about on here...they said they're sending out a replacement immediately. A month later--NOTHING! Thanks Fred, I guess immediately equates to anywhere from 3 days to 1 year to never in your book. Please send me my flask New Yorker here ... When do I get mine? Received my flask today in Canada. Green looks great! I received my Flask (charcoal) in Brisbane Australia last week. Very nice flask, enjoy using it at uni and when I"m going out without a bag as it fits in my pocket. Biggest disappointment was that the wrist strap snapped before I even got it around the bottle head! Received my flasks! Thanks for finally coming through Fred. Quality seems good. Hi guys just received my flask in the UK! Pretty pleased with it. Feels solid and nice to use. It's replaced my glass water bottle. Wish I'd backed for 2 of them lol Nice to know that some backers are getting their flasks. I hope to receive mine some day. I just got my 2 flasks. They offer me Brushed and Charcoal, which at this point I will take anything as long as I receive something. It turns out the flasks are nice and the quality is very good. So I think they are not giving up. Hi all, U.K. Backer and received my flasks this week... Great quality, blue, green and a stainless steel. This process has been frustrating but the main issue is the communication! All I can say is that they have finally arrived so keep contacting them and good luck! Guys, write the Fred Team a message. I did so. Ordered 4 Flasks. Brushed, White, Marsala, KS Green. After quite a long time (kinda 3 weeks) they answered my message. They offered me Brushed and Charcoal instead. I told them, that I dont want 4 Flasks anymore because Marsala and KS Green were the reason why I pledged. So I told them I would accept 1 Brushed and 1 Charcoal and a refund for the 2 other flasks. And they finaly managed it! Received those Flasks last week and they are really nice! Message them, Guys! Still waiting for my 2 flasks, never again! still no flask here Still waiting on my flask. Flasks arrived in New Zealand, Thanks Fred, product looks good, please try harder with communication next time, full credit for not giving up. Cheers I can't believe I actually got my 2 flasks here in the U.S. after SUCH a long frustrating experience, but at least it happened. Glad to put this whole thing behind me. Today the flask also arrived in Austria! Nice work Fred...but it took seriously way toooooooooooooooooooooo long! So a happy Kickstarter ending... I guess. Got my flasks today here in Finland. Took a looooong time, but the bottles are pretty, and seem to hold water too :) Accepted plain stainless steel instead of a white one. I hope the rest of the people get their flasks soon. Canada - also received confirmation from Fred and a tracking number for the shipment. I'm much happier now knowing that it's late, rather than never! I will post again once I receive them to give my first impressions on them. :) Thank you, I have received tracking for the flask and its on its way to Canada! Not received my flasks they messaged me on here the other day. confirmed my address , good. I sent a message to Fred Water on all their social media a year ago, and they finally replied to my facebook message today. AFTER ONE YEAR. And all they said was to email <email>, which I have. Still no flasks. Extremely disappointed. Ok, let's try that too - haven't got my flask yet, please appear... Update: Shortly after posting my comment I got a message saying that my flask was sent a long time ago. It must have gotten lost in the mail. They offered to send me a new one, and I received it today. The flask seems very nice and I am satisfied. I just got a message out of nowhere from Fred asking if I commented on the this message board, lately. I responded so hopefully we'll see if they reply back with a solution. My flask leaks from both caps. Never received mine. It's been so long I almost forgot I pledged for it. Sorry that should read "but hope this helps put minds at rest that although it's slow going, it looks like they are trying to fulfil orders". Autocorrect... :( OK guys, I just got a message from Fred stating they are ready to ship my reward! Had left a few messages too. Really hope you guys get a response soon too, but hope this helps and puts minds at rest that l though it's slow going, it looks like they are still trying to fulfil orders. Jon, thanks for the tip. I'm in same situation as you--several nice KS messages and emails with no response. I filed a BBB complaint myself today, and suggest the forgotten "5%" do as well. And to Kickstarter---I respectfully and considerately ask that you remove the sentence: "Our community is founded on a few core values –– transparency, trust, and honesty" from your community page, since y'all only follow the procedure of passing the buck and leaving the customer screwed. I've finally had a response from Fred as well via Kickstarter. The colours I requested aren't available in the "new 2.0" format but I actually couldn't care less any more. I would recommend that anyone else who still hasn't received their flasks contact the Better Business Bureau as Jon did below. I honestly feel his complaint might be the only reason Fred responded to me. I have received a refund via paypal less then a week after filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau in California. I'm convinced that is the only way that anyone from Fred is going to respond. Once again, I suggest all those who are still waiting do the same thing. I can now wash my hands of this project. Best of luck to everyone else. Just to let you know I've had a response from Fred via Kickstarter! Fingers crossed this is the start of something better. "We do have new 2.0 designs in and recommend sending out a brushed. If ok, we will send out tomorrow." Still missing my 4 Flasks here in Germany. Still waiting in Canada. ...... fred yall got some explaining to do For those that have not received your item contact local law enforcement and file a report. Filed a complaint with the BBB. All you idiots at Fred had to do was answer one of the emails or multiple messages I sent. I suggest everyone who hasn't received their flask or a refund to do the same. Might be time to do yourselves a favour Fred, communicate! Are we getting flasks? Have you run out of money? What happened? If you can not deliver then at least let us know why and what went wrong? Fred water flask = Takes your pledge & runs off. At least I only pledged 1 flask and lost my money. I now use a refillable glass voss bottle. I WANT MY MONEY BACK! After waiting, writing (over 20 messages) and waiting...with no response... My hope is gone, that I will ever see this product .... LESSON LEARNED !!!! Not a thing. No answers. No flask. No good. ... ignoring messages and disappearing from here and social media makes things look worse Still waiting... Just wanted to confirm I'm in Canada and still waiting for my flask as well. I see why they sent through an extra stainless cap now. After a few months of use, the paint has started coming off the white cap really badly. Think I'll switch to stainless too, as I'm fed up of having paint come off in my hands, and it's starting to look pretty obvious where it has peeled off too. I guess the cap and bottle go through separate processes for colouring, because the bottle hasn't had any such issues (touch wood). Still waiting for a reply.. 4 Flasks backed.. Hello, I am in Canada and still waiting. I am a patient man and am waiting for another project over a year due <url>#824 here. I received the flask on April last year and I was shocked when I check back the public comment here. So many backers didn't get their flask yet and have no response from Fred. Still waiting at Hong Kong Be respectful and considerate. I would like to receive my flasks. Still waiting for 1. flask, 2. Some type of response from you 3. Mayby en apology. Still waiting. Ugh Still waiting for 4 flasks in the UK. I would accept a refund, but really just want some indication of what is going on, good news or bad. I opened a complaint with Kick Starter regarding the horrible communication after the project was funded. Their response was basically this, "read the terms of service, we take no responsibility for project creators actions." That's it for Kick Starter for me. Still waiting for 1. flask, 2. Some type of response from you 3. Mayby en apology. Still no flasks here in Germany.. Still no flasks here in Germany.. Still waiting in Ireland, messages, tweets and Instagram posts and no response! Find it strange how so many people have theirs and there are still a select few who have been completely ignored! Anyone know why? Crap, my flask really leaks... Hi there I'm still waitikg for my flask � Thank you for your sending. Swift Still waiting! lets report this ignorant team. Has anyone received a marsala coloured flask? I've had no response from Fred & I'm close to giving up. Would be happier if they came on here & said they just can't do it, but the key issue for me is that they're apparently still trading. Worst of all they look to be accepting pre-orders for these very flasks on their website still! Poor form, Fred. Still waiting in Russia... Still waiting in Australia...14 messages and no response... Still waiting in Canada. Anybody in Canada receive theirs yet? still haven't received my bottles. what a pity. Still waiting... 3 messages without a reply. Still waiting... I am also still waiting for mine :( I'm surprised that there are still people without their bottles. I received my bottle ages ago (July 2015) and even got prompt help with the metallic taste (soak it in hot water, a little soap and lemon slices for an hour or two and rinse it clean) which removed it. Sad that a portion of backers have been ignored. :( Ugh. Still waiting. Tried communicating with Fred & Co. at least three times and was ignored every time. I finally filed a complaint with Kickstarter and pointed out the history of negligent customer service, sub-par quality, and general BS. It ticks me off that they have a fancy website with a load of endorsements, yet they treat the actual backers like clowns, stringing us along for over a damn year. I don't like being ripped off. My two flasks arrived today in The Netherlands. They don't leak. I accepted Stainless instead of coloured, as Fred said there were problems with the blue and green. I've had no communication since December, and then I laid into them on FB and Insta. So although it's hard, and they don't seem to want to communicate, it seems as if they are fulfilling the orders - albeit at a snail's pace... From now on the big 'F' on the flask will stand for 'F#cking thirsty'... Keep the faith, backers. Get a GRIP, Fred - you had a great product and thousands of fans - now you've got thousands of p!ssed off people, irrespective of how good the product is. Epic Fail... perhaps that's what the 'F' stands for too? Tired of waiting. Would even take a partial refund at this stage. First Kickstarter I've backed which has failed to deliver. Hi, My pledge (2 stainless steel bottles) has still not arrived yet. I have now: - messaged you 3 times via Kickstarter - emailed you twice via your website - added a comment on this update - contacted the Kickstarter team who tried to contact you on my behalf You never replied. I am hugely disappointed that you treat your backers with so little respect. Please let me know what the status on my pledge is and send it as soon as possible. I encourage backers to click on the Campaign tab, scroll down to "Report this project to Kickstarter", and select the last option, "Post-funding issues". The reason for this is the sheer lack of communication by the creators. It's clear that the project is well-overdue with many people without any idea what is going on. Please report them as instructed above so that we may receive an update about the current status of orders and outlook of the project. Thanks guys. Still waiting... At the moment would be perfectly happy with a re-fund The pieces of metal coming off inside my flask and the metallic taste isn't acceptable/is dangerous to my health. Mind issuing a refund? I've tried emailing you guys through every avenue possible and have called 877-437-9283 numerous times. Can someone please have the decency to respond? The pieces of metal coming off inside my flask and the metallic taste isn't acceptable/is dangerous to my health. Mind issuing a refund? I've tried emailing you guys through every avenue possible and have called 877-437-9283 numerous times. Can someone please have the decency to respond? 4 months ago you were already late, and said it would be a few more weeks. And you guys haven't replied or given us any updates. What a joke. I feel like a right mug. What an absolute joke, this whole saga will go down in the annals of history of how not to conduct a product campaign. Poor form you lot poor bloody form Still waiting. ........ Fantastic. Still no reply. Awesome. 9 more mths to 2 Yrs anniversary of scam. Fred I'm asking u bring me up to speed on where my flask's B. If u send them out by Monday we could have them on the hgtv channel by May. Still waiting. ........ Still waiting. ........ Still haven't received anything. No shipping notices, no bottles. I'm still due my 2 flasks here in the U.S. The 2 I backed are Brushed Steel and Army Green, which were supposed to be in the first shipments out, I thought. I'v ordered at 2014, still waiting.... no reply, no follow up, Fuck! Still hoping to receive the flasks. I can't believe that after waiting so long they sent me the wrong colour. No response to any emails, messages or posts on FB. I think they are trying to set some sort of record for poor customer service. Don't worry Fred, you win, you have the poorest customer service. Congratulations. Nothing in Canada yet. To everyone annoyed they've not received their flasks, you're going to be hugely disappointed if/when they do arrive. Cover the shipping costs and you can have mine for free, it's been sat in the cupboard since first using it. The metallic taste and poorly machined lid aren't quite to my taste. My God, can someone please just let us know when we will get our rewards! This is past ridiculous! fuck u Hello I was wondering if any Canadian orders have been fulfilled as I am still waiting for my order Oh and to any Fred representatives that see my previous post: I just want to say that it shouldn't have come to this. It is ridiculous that one of you cannot type a simple update of what is going on. The bottles exist or they don't. The bottles are in California or China or somewhere between. You are all just slack individuals who no longer give a crap about the last few hundred people who supported your campaign.... I would much prefer updates along the lines of "Sorry Dudes we are having real problems delivering on our promise but we are working hard on it. Stay awesome etc etc. Not answering anybody is antisocial, unprofessional and rude. Eventually when people lose patents with the proper channels they are compelled to try something else to get your attention and get some answers. It has occurred to me that there are enough angry people making comments about poor service from this company that we may be able to use our collective skills to do something more direct about it. Companies usually respond to dents in their bottom line. Perhaps we could flood their regular ordering system with false orders? Or clog their website email with questions? Or perhaps find the mobile phone numbers for the key employees and ask them (politely) to give us some information? Or maybe cutting and pasting all of these comments and posting them wherever might get an effect all over the web. Perhaps their celebrity spokes people can be targeted? If most of you feel like me we just want a truthful accurate update about what is going on. Made a comment o n instagram after no response to my last comment. And no response by email. Received a comment back on instagram. But alas still no flasks. Fred Team... How can you people be so shameless? I hope I get mine soon! Hopefully I will receive my 4 flasks someday... Last Update: December 2015 "Approximately 95% of our backers have received their reward and we have been chipping away at getting that number to 100%." That would relate to 231 backers who have yet to receive their rewards. Considering there have been 500+ comments regarding no communication, no rewards, no product, no refund - it is extremely disappointing to learn that Fred Water has tricked such a large community of enthusiastic and supportive people. They clearly show no regard for respectable business ethics, and are deteriorating the platform that Kickstarter has grown. Please make things right. Release an update. Respond to emails. Take responsibility. Out of the blue, I received my charcoal flask to my overseas military address. Great piece of gear. Don't understand why this company refuses to respond to communications, but hopefully this will give some of you hope. No flask. No response. Tracking number USPS LZ660438356US (14 Dec 2015) Tracking number USPS LZ672479565US (22 Feb 2016) Didnt get jackxxx. Feel free to run the numbers through USPS. I got ripped off for the bottles and shipping(20 bucks no less). plz.. give my bottle!!!! i wait long time!!! No flask here in Singapore either!! Wonder if this is for real...... Still no flasks in Canada. Kickstarter should look into developing an insurance program for backers that have been scammed. Keep a portion of the funds collected until every backer has received the product they paid for. Dear Fred, For many years in university I carried around a plastic Fred bottle. He was my faithful companion, and water became synonymous with Fred, like vacuum cleaner with Hoover. I am deeply disappointed in you. Not because it's April 2016 when the KS fundraiser started in Dec 2014, but because you have failed to respond to me in any way, even once. It's so easy just to keep people informed and you have failed miserably, and frankly, it's pathetic. I can understand that it may be hard to reply to all Emails, But all you have to do is Just send one to every one letting them know that you are still working hard, and some general time line! Majority of other Kickstarters do this, Have any of you experienced Purchasing from Kickstarter?? And what common curtesy might look like?? No flask and no response to my messages. Ironic that I thought this would be a safe KS to back out of all the projects I backed. All the others have turned up fine apart from this one lol. ordered dec 2014. still no flask. OMG, not a single update all year. I ordered in 2014 and when it arrived four weeks ago I had the wrong colour! I emailed the same day. No response. I emailed three weeks later... and commented all over Instagram and Facebook, still no response. I was patient for a very long time but now it has gone beyond that. Now I am searching for every article and review so that I can comment on every one of them, advising people to come here and see how unhappy Fred Water's customers are with their sloppy quality checks and non-existent customer service. I can understand making a mistake with the colour but refusing to answer emails is not acceptable. Just send me what I ordered! Freddy WTF call me ASAP Gona hunt u till my bundle shows up Off to insta I go It's pretty clear that Fred has washed their hands of the backers that still haven't received their flasks. No response to email, tweets, IG, KS messages, carrier pigeons or smoke signals. They don't even log in to KS anymore (March 9 was the last log in). Still waiting for my flask in Austria, was it already sent? Only had a confirmation survey email, no flasks. Please improve you communication with your backers very soon. My flasks are in "transit" since months and nobody of your company has sent any response to my messages. :( Hi fred team, couldn't get you to respond thru email, IG n most likely nothing from here too. It's like a prayer, to a Blackbox. U have given me 2 Tracking ID and never once did I receive anything. Both Id in USPS still showe as id is only created, not a receipt of item by usps. Hoodwinked me twice here. Ending my prayers here. HI I have still not received my two flasks? will they ever come? Please can you advise when I can expect to receive my flask? Still eagerly awaiting my single stainless steel flask... Hi Fred team, From the comments below I conclude you're still busy sending out the rewards. Please, please don't forget to send me my 2 bottles (white & steel). I didn't move house, didn't change colours, nothing to make things complicated. Just waiting.... One more thing about the bottles. Handle them with care if you want the paint to stay on. I went cycling yesterday and I placed the bottle into a steering bag. After cca 20km it has no more paint on the corners... Still waiting on my 4 flasks. Also still waiting on anyone in this company to respond to any communication. I received an email from a Jen In October last year that said this. "Hi Jamie, We have you on our list to ship. We are awaiting a batch from the factory and will be sending you when to expect very shortly. Thank you. - Jen This is a real stretch of the term shortly. Since then I have sent 2 more emails and no replies have come. Very disappointing. Especially when you look at the FAQ about when will I get my flask. 8 weeks from when you raised 50000. That elapsed a long time ago....... I found a solution for a better grip on the cap. You know those tapes you see on some steps? The black one that looks like smirk paper and are there to prevent slippage. Well I had this at home as I taped a short piece of it on my photo camera and I tried it on the cap. It works perfectly. Just small area is already enough. And you can get those tapes in many colors. Just a small tip in case someone finds it useful ;) I received my two bottles today. One Kickstarter green and one black. I can say that it is visible they have been working on the thread and caps as my black one has a completelly different thread and cap as the green one. I assume the black is newer. However they have still not solved the washer problem and my black one leaked a little with the original washer. I solved it so that I removed the original washer and placed in two thin foam ones I cut out from the packaging foam and added the rubber/silicone washer which was also in the package. So now it does not leak anymore. But I still think they need to find a solution for this. As you really want to be sure it will not leak. Otherwise the bottles are OK. They stand on the table and they look nice. It is true that caps could use some rougher surface for easier unscrewing. Hi Fred Team, I have lost count of how many times I have attempted to contact someone. Can you please return my contact and let me know when I will be receiving my rewards? I HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY FLASKS AND NOBODY FROM THIS TEAM WILL RESPOND TO ANY COMMUNICATION FROM ME. HI I have still not received my two flasks? will they ever come? Finally received my flasks in Sydney Aust Quality is pretty good, there was a little steel sliver attached to the thread of one bottle that drew blood, but once I twisted it off it was fine. they all stand up find, and don't leak. I would have liked a little grip on the bottle caps, especially as they threads aren't the best fit, so its a little grating to screw on, off. Also, one lid, once screwed on, would not come off, at seemed to just twist without unscrewing, vise grips solved that issue, and the second lid worked fine. overall very happy, great size, although it does feel a bit like a giant hip flask for the serious drinker. Very cool bottle. I'm using it al the time at the moment. For those that have talked about odd tastes, I let some bi-carbinate of soda and water sit in the bottle overnight, after a good shake, and then shake again and rinse it out - no odd taste to be found. Twice they said they mailed. Twice they have given me the 'tracking number'. Twice there was no tracking at all on usps. I kinda of believe they don't give a damn. Dodgy af. Received my flask in Turkey today, finally!! Thanks! Backer #3077 still hasn't received his flask in Brussels. Hope it will not be rusted by the time I received it. Hi. The tracking number you sent me on January 15 still says that the USPS still has not received the item for shipment. It is now March 12. Backer #694, still haven't received my flask in Brisbane Australia although seeing that people are still receiving fills me with hope! Backer # 1,070 - I finally received my order of 8 Fred bottles in Sydney. It took a long time and most of that time, in the dark without any communications. I would ask that everyone who has not received their bottles to hang in there. Delivery is slow but it does seem like Fred is honouring all orders from KS. Good luck everyone. Backer sumtin, I'm owed 4 bottles DM me or sumtin Backer 4094 here. Slowly giving up hope but good to see some people are receiving theirs finally! Maybe there's still hope Well... It took time but I received my 8 bottles today and they're absolutely worth the wait. None leak, no thread issues with caps and no dents or scratches. Id say if you're still waiting youre gonna get a perfect product. I had my doubts and FRED tested my patients but delivered in the end. Hope they can sort out the logistics & wrap up this kickstarter. Surely the wait has been worse for them then us backers. Still give em an F in communications... Good to hear that some people are receiving their product. I just wanted to confirm that I have NOT received mine yet, but am still hopeful. Just realised most of us have pledged over a year ago..... and still haven received anything. Well my optimistic post yesterday has paid off. I just got a message from Fred that my bottles have shipped to Slovenia. I got the KS confirmation and also a private message from Fred. So I am quite happy about it. Hope everything turns out OK after all this time. These guys are a bunch of tools. Man up and respond to your backers you pieces of shit. You guys are TWEEZOTS! Google it mofos. Backer #1039. Just received my 8 bottles. Well worth the wait. I look forward to using these. Just wished the bottle cap had a little more grip. It is good to hear that some people are still receiving flasks. This makes me optimistic in spite of the waaay too long delay. Well Gordon...I just received word my 8 bottles are to ship out today. Fingers crossed. Backer # 1,070, ordered 8 bottles. Received 0. Replies from Fred 0. No way to run a business Fred. Will I ever get my bottles. I was stocked with your campaign. Seeing that you already had a business with glass bottles, I thought the risk of being shafted would be less. I am still hoping that I will be wrong. Maybe I can pass my hope to my grandkids.... HI I have still not received my two flasks? will they ever come? So I received my KS green flask today in Canada ... even though they already gave me a refund. Why would they send me one when there's plenty of people to send to ? I am in eastern U.S. ... placed order 11.25.14 for two flasks - backer # 723 ... still no shipping information ... very frustrated with this campaign. USPS are showing my parcel processed into their sort facility, so it looks good. Still waiting in Canada. Ha! I finally received my flasks today. Order placed 12/31/14.....order received 3/1/2016. Good luck everyone! USPS have the tracking number active now. This could be it boys. Sydney is ready for these flasks. Where the fuck is my rewards? email and contact you so many times, late reply or no reply at all, are you even want to achieve what you said you want to on this campaign and your website? No specific color, fine, how long would i need to wait, what other option do I have? No, you just told me out of stock and totally silence, WTF? still no flasks here in Germany! haven't gotten mine. need to get my address changed. message me, fred water. I have received a tracking number, although USPS doesn't recognise it as yet. fingers crossed it means I will get my flasks soon. Still nothing here either, last e-mail I got was on 8th Dec '15 - my money was collected for it on 31st Dec 2014 - it's now 29th Feb 2016 & still no flask or tracking number or refund which I did ask for last Dec. About time they showed us some consideration! Talk to us! Fyi getting a tracking number doesnt mean jackshxxt. Twice it says notification only on USPS. its kinda of funny of them to claim that the first delay was due to mail fraud in my country.(singapore) Yeah... I agree with ya Gordon. 8bottles backed, in Canada... Absolutely zero communication my way. I've tried to stay positive but this whole MIA nonsense is beyond weak. There's really no excuse for not letting us know what's up. Even if they're f-ed, just tell us that much. A little "hey we're sorry but we're broke and spent all ur money" would suck but at least it would bring us some closure. I feel like I've lost a relative at sea and 15 years later am still holding out hope that they'll be found.... Just TELL ME SHE'S DEAD ALREADY or give us a little boost of hope and communicate SOMETHING!! I am in Australia and on the 18th I was told this was shipped to me. They have not arrived yet.. If they have really shipped at all. I asked for confirmation and got nothing back. I helped kickstart this great project. <url>"Be respectful and considerate." next to the "Post comment" box. How does that old saying go....."Do to others as you would have others do to you!" I placed my order on Dec 31st 2014. I have no flasks or even a shipping confirmation as of today Feb 23rd 2016. I was backer #2219. I live in the US on the East Coast. Is there any possible legit explanation as to why I have not received a refund or my 2 flasks?? Anyone else waited this long to see NOTHING? -Dan I have not received my flasks or any response to my messages or emails. Very poor customer service. I finally got my flask in December (White flask, Japan). I sent them a DM at the start of the month and got a reply a couple of days later saying mine had passed QA and was ready to be shipped. It arrived a couple of weeks later. I've had a leak only once, when I failed to screw the cap closed properly. There are a couple of spare seals and a spare cap in the package, but I haven't got to using them. Overall very satisfied with the product, and every time I use it, it turns heads, people ask me what it is, where I got it, etc. Haven't received mine (New Zealand) either. Not happy Also still waiting in Canada. USPS pre-shipment notification on January 15 2016. But they still haven't made their way to the post office. So if you want a response you will need to post to Instagram. They don't reply to DM's here or on Facebook. I have had a couple of my comments removed, gave all my flasks away just to have two of them leak. Good luck to everyone, and I will continue to post to their Instagram, Facebook and Twitter pages in order to warn others not to give their money to this company. Hello I have still not received my two flasks. Can you please let me know where they are?? Thanks, Sam (Tas, Australia) Still waiting for 5 flasks in the UK.... Have tried DM etc. No response. No flasks in the UK. Received a message claiming they would b shipped soon in December. Nothing since. If someone told me back in summer that communication could get even worse, I would have laughed at him. But Fred works hard to surprise us backers from time to time. :):):) No flasks, no refund, no reaction whatsoever to mails and dm's dated December12, January 3, January16 and Januari25..... Please!! (The Netherlands) I am really frustrated. I ordered my flask December 2014, and then did not get it until June 2015. And it leaks It has been leaking this whole time and I want to return the flask. It gets my whole lunch box wet. It is really bad. How do I return this flask? Australia. One orange flask. Still no sign. give me tracking, or refund. hey, i wait this flask one year tow month.. where is my flask? @peter ng. From Singapore too. Nothing. Did u get a tracking number? I gotten one back in Dec 15, however the status never change... It's still show as notification received on Fred having intention to deliver. Anyone else received theirs in Singapore? I have yet to receive mine... This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. You should all tweet to them!! <url>"be respectful and considerate" comment for posting. Wish that could be reciprocated since all of us pledged money to help this project. Lesson learned. Nothing here... 2 messages not returned!!! Bullshit 2 months 5 days since FRED has gone MIA... Nothing to California. YUP STILL HAVENT RECEIVED OURS. Glad to hear nobody else received theirs in Canada yet either. (Well, happy that the flasks SHOULD be shipping to Canada still vs them missing me I mean). Nothing to Canada yet. Tracking ID received on 14 Dec. Usps still show as preshipment. Man, you guys sure take long send it down to postal office. >. > I have received all 4 of my flasks. All of them were in great condition, no leakages and everyone has been using them for about a 3 weeks now. Colours are superb and the extra rubber sealings work perfect. Those of you that have not received anything should send an email to them. I got a reply pretty damn quick. The reason given for the delay is the colour on the Kickstarter green. I told them to choose another colour and they then sent out the flasks immediately. I must admit it has been the wait. Still waiting for 5 flasks in UK. Why did I do it..! Dying of thirst in Australia... Still hoping to receive What happened to hiring more people to keep up with communication?? Maybe you need to hire someone to keep up with the person keeping up with communication. Just got mine today! From Singapore Still nothing here in Germany. Waiting for two Flasks... @Jon It's even more likely people would post when they don't get their flask. So there would be way more complaints if thousands were still waiting. My guess is most got their flask(s) half a year ago and moved on. It just seems that the production of the last four or so colors really is a drag. I am certainly curious to know the actual numbers of backers who have received their product. There should be a lot more....and I mean a lot more people posting that they received their flasks if the 95% shipped number is correct from Fred. I know that most people don't post when they get their product, but if the shipped numbers are correct, there should be a ton more people posting. Say what you want but this is a failed project. I just hope I receive mine before I die, see that they either leak or are bent, have a good laugh and move on. Just wandering if there is any update when the shipment to Canada may start @20eighty4 Sorry, so your experience is a standard mark for 4623 backers? @ gordon gek nope you're wrong this is a failed project backed 5 flasks and only 1 was good meaning the other 4 had welding slag. Not good. So go stand on your soap box elsewhere. Please refund, thanks. I've sent several emails, contacted you on instagram, no improvement. @20eighty4 It has not been a complete failure. Heaps of people have theirs and are happy. It has just been a painful campaign and NO COMMUNICATION right now, sucks balls. From the last update We know that response time to Messages has been slow and we have made improvements on that front via additional staffing. We apologize to those who experienced communications delays. You can hate on Adam... just make sure it's for the right stuff.. Do these guys have a phone number?? Hey Adam, Your project is a complete failure and a direct reflection of you. FYI Fred, not everyone has spare cash to throw around on NON EXISTANT ITEMS. I want a refund. Backing Fred Water was possibly the worst purchase decision I've ever made. What an absolute joke. Your customer service is appalling. "In terms of our customer service, we do apologize. Starting tomorrow we have freed up resources to communcate w backers in a way that's informative. We know people just want their flask(s)." They posted this months ago. This level of cutover service needs a new term as appalling just doesn't do it justice. How about logging in and simply stating what you are doing? I would welcome any of the following: 1. We suck at this and we are still making one bottle a day, shipping it from China on a Donkey. Checking it in our warehouse and they sending it back out on a sled pulled by snails. We intend to have the bottles all delivered in time for your Great grandchildren to inherit them from your estate. 2. We have given up and taken the money of the last few suckers who didn't get what seems to be a product of hit and miss quality. At least if they tell us number 2 we can stop living with the nagging hope that one day we might get what we paid for. I wonder if all those celebrity endorsers know of this debacle and if they still proudly swig water from Fred flasks? Still nothing to APO address. Ordered 1x Stainless Steel. Terrible communication and customer service. Can't get a response ordered x4 and nothing Fred WTF get me my reward ASAP or I will come get it. Backer 3,987 here - @Fredwater please for the love of God respond to my message to your inbox sent weeks ago. Thank you. @Lennart, Good to hear you got it! Backer 1,548 BC, Canada 1 Stainless and 1 Marsala flask Nothing yet, hopefully soon. An update would be reassuring. Cheers. Still haven't gotten my 2 flasks here in the U.S. No Flasks here in Germany Fred, for the love of God. It's the end of January 2016 and I still haven't receive my water flasks. I would contact your customer service but it seems there's no point as no one ever replies. Hey FRED, Just looking for an update on the status of the flasks I backed. Its been about a year now. Any information would be great. Thanks. Jan 2016, and NOTHING... Hi there Fred-team, Can you please please reply to my posts and DM's send on December12, January 3 and January 16 ??? This user's account has been deleted. I have given up hope of ever receiving anything from this project. No response from any messages sent. Well. I finally received the two flasks I ordered. They look beautiful and actually hold water. But the taste of the water is horrendous. It tastes super metallic and looking inside I can assume that it is from the welding. Thanks for the massive effort Fred but its been a colossal fail. I will go back to my Glass bottle. Better luck next time I'm with u Gordon... Soon incredibly patient but this is very very tough. Radio silence is not the play. I never receive the flask I pledged for and it is over a year now. What happened? This is really bad. Respond please Man... This sucks!! Fucking say something Fred!! @Andre I'm sorry, I was to lazy and never scrolled down to read what was going on. FW, I have messaged multiple times. You have not responded. Your customer service is appalling. @zen dude you are preaching to the wrong folks LOL we haven't gotten shit yet haha So I was one of the ones that receive my flask early, can some one please explain as to why the flask doesn't sit (standing) flat with the surface? When I emailed the company their answer was "It's not meant to sit flat." So what you're telling me is, I backed a wobble flask? Anybody else have this problem?? Emailed for a refund. No response but that seems normal from all the complaints I'm hearing. so... where is my flask i have literally been in the dark since putting down my money an update would be cool Hi there Fred-team, Can you please please reply to my posts and DM's send on December12 and January3 ??? it is possible to get a refund? Still haven't received my flask, or any replies to my emails. (UK order also) Would be nice if someone got in touch, the customer service has been pretty non-existent. i still have not received my flask or updates, backer 3,399 i still have not received my flask or any updates. @Chai Kok Young from SG here. gotten an email with a tracking number, however, the status is forever on pending receiving item from mailer....... I wonder if Tony Hawk has received his flask yet? I've been reaching out to <email> and have not heard back. Simply looking to check the status of my order (backing)... Will � Anyone in the UK got their flask yet? I am backer number 3838 Is it just me? Anyone in Singapore have gotten their flask?? I am backer: 3,896. I'm a class a stalker. He(or whoever managing this) logs in daily and can't be bothered about updating, responding to emails etc. Hi, Received 1 or 3 flasks. Following up as per your last update. Is it possible to update the address for the last two? :( still waiting... Any news? Any update? Perhaps a little cheeky Happy New Year and we've not forgotten you even though you're ignoring messages here and on email. Hey Guys, so they seem to be responding to people over on Instagram. I left a comment about my damaged one on their Insta and got a response from someone named Jen through Kickstarter. I got my flasks after pestering them for weeks with multiple comments on multiple media platforms. I ended up giving all of mine away, they are not that great to be honest. Go get yourself a Hydroflask and call it a day. I hope everyone gets what they ordered. Oh Fred, we are still waiting on that FAQ promised to us back in OCTOBER!!!!!!!!!!! I guess I'm out $23 never got anything what a joke. Did not get any packetage. Backer no. 1,082 Hi fred can i get an update on my flask please thanks kickstarter green colour cheeers Looks like most other people have backer no.s in 3 thousand range! You forget about me? Haven't received my 2 flasks here in the U.S., despite a promise they were being sent in mid-December. No tracking number. Have followed up, but haven't heard back. Really hope they come through. I like the fact that there is a reminder best to the post comment button to be respectful and considerate. I wonder if the folks at Fred have seen that? One year past the estimated shippment date and almost two years since the project was funded. When does Kickstarter step in? Needless to say that you have some pretty disappointed backers. Refund please.....I think you have had enough time to rectify problems and now it's time to just make it right. As you can see they have not kept to their end of the bargain. When a project is successfully funded, the creator must complete the project and fulfill each reward. Once a creator has done so, they’ve satisfied their obligation to their backers. Throughout the process, creators owe their backers a high standard of effort, honest communication, and a dedication to bringing the project to life. At the same time, backers must understand that when they back a project, they’re helping to create something new — not ordering something that already exists. There may be changes or delays, and there’s a chance something could happen that prevents the creator from being able to finish the project as promised. If a creator is unable to complete their project and fulfill rewards, they’ve failed to live up to the basic obligations of this agreement. To right this, they must make every reasonable effort to find another way of bringing the project to the best possible conclusion for backers. A creator in this position has only remedied the situation and met their obligations to backers if: they post an update that explains what work has been done, how funds were used, and what prevents them from finishing the project as planned; they work diligently and in good faith to bring the project to the best possible conclusion in a timeframe that’s communicated to backers; they’re able to demonstrate that they’ve used funds appropriately and made every reasonable effort to complete the project as promised; they’ve been honest, and have made no material misrepresentations in their communication to backers; and they offer to return any remaining funds to backers who have not received their reward (in proportion to the amounts pledged), or else explain how those funds will be used to complete the project in some alternate form. The creator is solely responsible for fulfilling the promises made in their project. If they’re unable to satisfy the terms of this agreement, they may be subject to legal action by backers. Hey Adam step up and be a man in regards to your campaign. Nothing yet. Any updates? Ontario,Canada Still no flask. No tracking. Nothing. Update to Military APO address? @Creator On December 9, you replied in your last update that you would replace my leaking (defective) flask and have yet to follow up with me on how to get that done. Please let me know. One of the flasks I got yesterday leaks. Of course. In Singapore. Received a tracking number. Usps still show pre shipment notification... And it's already 3weeks. I'm starting to lose faith again. Where are my flasks? I got mine today, Edmonton, AB. It took about 3 weeks from when I got the tracking number though. Hi Fred Flask, I haven't received my product and will be moving to Australia in a couple of days. Any possible updates on the situation? Regards, Sam Still haven't received my flasks, or any communcation, or shipment notice. From ontario. Hi Fred, Sent both E-mail and PM to you guys for replacement caps and washers. No reply or any e-mail regarding it since 23rd July 2015. Hope to hear from you guys soon! Cheers Received my flask last week. Using it since then. I gotta say that the flask is pretty good, the caps screwed on nicely, no leaks. I carry the flask wherever I go. Still, the communication between Fred team and backers sucks, hope it will be better next time. Just received a Charcoal flask here in KL, Malaysia. Flask is sturdy and well made; no defects in terms of welding and coating; along with the insides. Metallic taste rectified after soaking with warm soap solution. Does not leak, however it does leak slightly when shaken with the lanyard attached. All in all, its a well made bottle that feels really great in the hand. Many thanks to the Fred team for crafting a great product albeit minor hiccups during manufacturing! Hello Fred-team, Still no flasks here and no tracking-code or other sign of them coming this way (The Netherlands). After many months of waiting and (re)using one-time platic bottles, I bought 2 white coated steel bottles for $9,50 each. They are round and not pocket-shaped, but still very nice and non-leaking. So I have no use for the Fred-flasks anymore and would like a refund. Could you please reply? regards, Barbara Hi guys still no flask here in the UK for me. Can you update us on what's going on please? Do we have any update on project status? Still waiting on one flask. Will accept plain steel or any color. Thanks. Well I got two flasks.. one of them was the right one, one was the wrong one.. lets see if i can get the right one replaced.. No tracking number and no flasks in Ontario. Any updates? Have recieved my flasks in Ontario,Canada. How do I clean this bottle on the inside? Any Best practices? Refunded after writing in to the customer service. New Years update would be sweet!! Backer 3,124 and I still have received nothing. Not even an email updating what is happening. Complete joke. I haven't received my bottles or any communication from fred water. very disappointing.. I've received my bottles recent days. To be honest, I'm not satisfy with the quality. There's too many scratch on them and make them look like used products. After waiting almost one more year, It's a pity to have such a bad pledging experience on this project. still waiting Received mine in Singapore today. External minor dings and scratches I can accept. Internal welding marks are unacceptable. Sharp enough to cut! Have emailed CSO, hope to get a reply. Don, the only man in this campaign to be scammed. Sucks to be you mate. I'm still waiting for mine, maybe they can send me yours as well. No flask, no update ... looks like I got scammed!!! Still no flask to Military APO address. Update please. Have not received any of the 4 I ordered Sent DM Nothing Please get my x4 flask to me please So Christmas has come, i send pm and commented but none of @FredWater has even noticed as it seems. Sad, so @FredWater again I ask for a refund. Thanks Best Jan Received today new caps. No leaks anymore. Thanks for this solution. Very nice bottle � Ship to Australia already!! Hello, As per your last update, you are asking the last 5% of backers to update you, well here it is. I have yet to receive my order from Fred Water Flask. I have sent a few messages in the recent months with NO response or update. Since 95% of you orders have been filled and I am in the last 5%, I can only imagine that my order should be filled soon? I'm hoping!! Please let me know a time line or any follow up info you have for me please!! Cheers Backer #3651 I got a tracking number. Edmonton, Alberta. So close! When I say arrived, that is arrived in the UK. Arrived!!! Stainless steel flask, two lids, two additional seals (not needed with first kid tried, no leaks) and a carry strap. Looks good, nice size and no leaks, hurrah. May buy a couple more for friends once these go on general sale (but I'll be sure to plan WELL in advance). Still no flask, sent an email, a message and commented but no one has got back to me about where the hell my money has gone? All I want are the two flasks I PAID for, what kind of a company is this that it thinks it's ok to do this to their customers/backers.... Still no flask. I posted prior comments on Kickstarter. I emailed Fred Water company directly on August 10, 2015. They asked for my address and said they would send the flask immediately. I sent my address. Still no flask. And no updates from anyone. Hi still no Flasks here too in the uk. Waiting in hope. Hello i still haven't received my flask thanks! Did they do the survey through backer kit? Can someone post the link so those of us who don't have them yet can do a double check that we did do the survey if so? Sometimes I hate backer kit bc the mail gets filtered. Whereas the Kickstarter end surveys always pop up in app or when you log into the site. 2 white flasks still missing in Germany. Hope Fred attaches the invoice on the outside of the package. If not customs will stop it and than bad times will come. @Fred: Do you can give any information about progress? Backer # 89 White flash. No news/info/tracking number.....UK. So no, backer number doesn't make any difference. Have tracking number and now receiving tracking notification updates. The flask is on its way to the UK! Still never got a replacement to mine that has a crack in the weld and leaks Correction. 231 is the remaining 5% According to Fred's last update, there are 231 people still waiting(95%). I sent a KS message as per their request less than an hour after the update. Over a week later I haven't received a response.. Still waiting on 4 flasks in Canada and still waiting to hear they've shipped and my tracking number. Absolutely no way these will be here for Christmas. Maybe they should send out e-cards for Christmas 2016... I am still waiting for my 4 flask. Any updates? I think backer numbers are not relevant to this campaign. I am backer 318. but unfortunately I backed for some white flasks, and I am in Australia. double whammy. It's been 1 year today and I am still waiting! Backer number 3136. Hi there backer number 2,196 here from Australia, still waiting on a kickstarter green flask and a lightblue flask.looking forward to getting them Still waiting here as well! What is everyone's backer number? I'm in the 2400s... Still no flask - any idea when??????? No flasks yet in Canada. Waiting on 8, one of each colour, but no green and 2 in black. Best of luck finishing up with this campaign FRED. Have not got mine yet, No tracking number Just got my tracking number for dispatch to the UK! Fingers crossed. after what i've seen, it seems like less than 95% received a flask yet. stop lying at us. Checked the flask last night and no leaks of any kind. I got a kickstarter green colour but the stainless cap is easier at screwing on than the coloured cap. I think the rubber seal in the cap is causing a bit too much friction to screw onn easily but with the stainless cap I will be able to use the flask easily. Still waiting for 2 colored flasks in France Sooo am I going to receive a tracking number or what? In Oz waiting for those two same coloured flasks Has anyone in Australia received flasks, especially a steel and white combo order? The flask arrived today. Its....absolutely flawless as far as I can see. Color is spot on. No leakage or dents. The caps screw on like the should. Ive finally received my flask in Ireland. Lets see tonight if it holds water. Yay go Fred. I had nearly forgotten all about this campaign. Thanks for the update. Anticipating the arrival of my Fred water bottle, :-) Regards Mike.V Still waiting for my 2 flasks. Thanks. Still waiting for my 4 flasks. Thanks. As per update 32, haven't received any Fred water bottles yet, backer number 4,010, ordered 2 bottles. I'm in Melbourne, Australia and other friends who ordered the bottles haven't got theirs either. Thanks. Backer #89 White, UK Please send before Christmas. Cheers! Hi - I still haven't received my flask, although I did receive email #32. Looking forward to getting the flask soon. Further to receipt of email update #32, I'm still awaiting receipt of my order... I ordered 5 flasks, only received two. One of them has bad caps that don't screw on properly. I also requested the remaining flasks to be shipped to me. I am your backer for Fred Water Flask. To date, I have not received the reward. My name is Sanchai Thiewprasertkul, and my email is <email> My shipping address is: Sanchai Thiewprasertkul Berli Jucker PLC,2fl Berli Jucker House, 99 Soi Rubia,Sukhumvit 42 Rd., Phrakanong,Klong Toei, Bangkok 10110, Thailand Can you please check my status and let me know what go wrong, and when will I receive my reward Thank for support, prompt response, and of course, shipment Regards Sanchai Thiewprasertkul Bangkok, Thailand Hey guys. Still haven't received my flask. I did however just receive a message saying that you were working hard to get them out. Just hope it's soon :) I still haven't received my flasks, or an answer to my PM and comments. Have Fred done a runner? Just one of many of the projects I have backed and never received anything , not even a response! Kickstarter and you make it difficult for me to get a project on , when myself and so many are honest people. Be respectful and considerate??? How about us. I paid for two flasks and have received nothing, not even an email. What the hell is going on, this is starting to take the absolute piss! Still waiting:( no flask no answer on my pm on dec. 1st no communication at all getting real disappointed :( This is suck. They are selling new plastic bottles and pending on this project. Over here: <url>#3667 5 flasks - any update? Backer #2899, looking for my 4 flasks. Any news Fred? Once again, I am still waiting for my brushed steel flask kinda hoping I get it at some point before Christmas... It wasn't a dig at you Phillippe, and well done on getting something out of them. It was a general comment over their piss poor management. Because they are in no way forced to give a refund. I gave you what I did and got a refund. I know they don't deserve politeness when they've given us lies after lies They are indeed complete amateurs when it comes to Kickstarter. Instead of paying celebrities to show up in their videos they should've put that money towards a community manager but what do I know. At the end of the day I did what I had to do in order to get my money back. A good reason!!! Polite!! Contact!! Why should anyone give them any of those values or efforts, when they have been nothing but rude, and amateur to anyone else. Just letting you guys know that I got a refund. If you have a good reason, you're polite, you're patient (really really patient) and you remind them that you saw them connected since you last sent your request they come through. Hope you guys don't have to wait longer for your refunds or flasks cheer Is there an update on potential delivery date? Noticed flasks were in the states back in October. Please advise :) I didnt yet received Where is our flasks!!!!!! Hi Fred Team, Still waiting for 2 flasks (or even information on when I might receive the flasks) here in Australia. Not getting any response to messages so trying the comments section...along with a fair few others it seems...please, please, please give as all some information on your final deliveries! Thanks. This user's account has been deleted. NEWS? 5 flasks to the UK??? Just checking in to see if the flasks in on their way any time soon? Maybe in time for christmas? ;) I never received my flask. Now I have moved. Guess I kiss my $27 goodbye. This makes me feel like all of Kickstarter is a huge scam. They have told me that they are on the final shipments now. My flask got posted and I have a tracking number but I was sending them private messages for about 2 or 3 weeks everyday until they replied. I missed 2 days I think but I left them know it was my pesky Chinese keyboard that could of been the problem for that :P They seem to be opening up communication lanes one by one so I think it shows a sign that they think they can combat most problems they get contacted with. Lets hope that they are nearly finished. For people looking for refunds I think its difficult to get one because you pledged your money to help the project and the reward of a flask for that is just a bonus so I think that would make it tricky. That's in my view at least. Does anyone have any clue what is going on here? Someone have a media connection local to Fred that might be able to get answers? Perhaps the worst run company of all time! There Instagram account is replying to comments. Jen is also sending info to me over pm fairly frequently now. Hey fellow backers. Their instagram account seems alive. This would have to be up there with the worst Kickstarter campaign in terms of communicating milestones/PR and being honest with backers. Maybe this campaign could be used as a case study of what not to do when communicating with customers. It clearly shows the need to invest/set aside funds to resource a PR/feedback and complaints structure within a campaign setting i don't want the flasks anymore. i DO WANT my money back. Fred should give all backs that are unsatisfied an uncomplicated way to have funds returned. At least I'm not the only one wondering where my flask is Any chance of EVER receiving the flask? Any chance of an update? STILL waiting in Canada for my four flasks.. How many times will we be told "flasks have passed final QC, shipping the remainders very soon" and then not hear anything for a couple months.. AND then "flasks were not up to standards"... Any news about mine in Oz? backer 4032 here..looking at the comments..i wonder if acknowledging this is a lost cause (money gone) could be a better outcome than receiving an inferior product. Hey guys, I got mine, but don't get to excited. One arrived damaged, one leaks, I know I won't get replacements and I can't get the metallic taste of them. These things are horrible and I hate I ever gave them my money. Save yourself the heartache and go buy a Hydroflask. Best decision I ever made. <url>"freed up" have not done their jobs. Backer 4788. Any news on shipping to UK yet. Any word on shipping ? Or this: Contact Federal Trade Commission for unfair trading at: Www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov For Americans please call: 1-877-FTC-HELP Kickstarter cannot help us as I have contacted them about another Kickstarter project. Maybe these will help: File a complaint with the Better Business Bureau (it sounds like the BBB and Trading Standards perform similar functions)- go to www.bbb.org and you can file a dispute online. Still no flask and you folks haven't responded to my last 2 messages over the past few months! � Has anyone else reported them to Kickstarter? So, the last update i saw was that all flasks are in the USA this past October. I still have NOT received mine. Can someone please contact me to give me a tracking number or a date of delivery? Fred are dicks. Tomorrow it will be 7 weeks since the last update saying they were posting the remaining balance. No tracking code. A new estimate please, Fred? Will these arrive by Christmas? I am just hoping to get an update on these and if they have shipped to Australia yet? Thanks was told 2 weeks ago that i would get a refund for a defective bottle, and then stopped getting replies. not even a little bit surprised. @fred I will make it my goal to make sure you don't ever get funded if you thieves decide to do another Kickstarter. Where's my refund? I can't imagine that this will surprise any of you, but just for info, it seems Fred are ignoring messages to their Twitter account as well. No sign or update on my one, single stainless steel flask. Anyone know if it's possible to get my money back? Still nothing heard in months. Only ordered one SS flask to ship to APO address. My first Kickstarter support just might be my last. I forgot to mention in my post from yesterday that I am in the US!?!?! Come on Fred let's hear the next excuse.....or ven just the next "story"! Nothing here either. I'm in Bangkok @bradhermann - they were on Amazon several months ago - if you check the comments on here they got some flak for it and took them off - I do have reason to believe that Amazon purchasers did get theirs first as I seem to remember seeing reviews on their Amazon page... Could be wrong Still waiting in Belgium. So its Friday. Any shipping evidence? I got an email today from fred to say the flask was shipped and to click the link to follow tracking but there was no link. anyone else get this? I'm from Ireland so international backers should expect the email soon id guess. @janotterstetter, International backer here. Not a word from Fred since funding went through. "...ready to ship to us to ship to those with problems and those final few who still have not received their reward." "final few". What a joke. They make it seem as though there are only a handful of backers (20 or less) that haven't received their flasks. Just from the comments on the project it's obvious they're completely full of sh*t. As for the "freed up resources to communicate with backers", seems as though they've freed up enough resources for two backers to be contacted. I guess that's better than it's been. At this rate I expect I'll be contacted sometime mid-2017. I searched Amazon and couldn't find any for sale there, FWIW. Ordered a stainless and black flask. Both have started to rust on the inside. Probably have used each around 3 times - yes fully dry after each use / clean with non-abrasive soaps etc.... Contacted Fred several times prior to this issue about ordering 10+ with no real substantive response... Requesting a refund or new product - assuming that the new bottles will do the same thing - would prefer a refund... Also - I read through some of the earlier posts and saw that Fred was selling bottles on Amazon and those customers were receiving their orders prior to the kickstarters - if it's true, that's pretty shitty of the Fred team... Still waiting for my flasks in canada. I ordered my 2 flasks over a year ago. I have had zero communication from Fred since. I see some people have received their flasks..... I will even take one that leaks at this point!! WTF! An update of some substance please!!! I received a tracking number at the end of April. I have received nothing. No replies to my last 4 messages. I can't say that I'm very impressed right now. Got a pm from Jen as well. Not a response yet, just another promise as yet unfulfilled. Cautiously hoping for a response/answers today! @Fred, i appreciate a better communication but first of all can you be a bit more precise when communicating? Yet you didn't answer the question if and when international delivery will happen. You be great to get a statement on that. @All others: How many international backers didn't get theirs, guess this is a great Numbers?! Thanks, regards Jan Finally got a response on a private message from a staff member named jen. Looks like communication will be improving. Backer #1571 - I got a FedEx tracking number on 11/12 and received my flasks on 11/17. They look great and feel great. No leaks. I was missing one lanyard, but I probably wasn't going to use them anyway (I think they cause the flask to leak). No problems, but one annoyance. The caps are a little difficult to screw on and off. However, if I remember back to my dad's metal canteens we used to use when camping, that's the deal with metal on metal. It would be nicer if there were some texture to the cap so it would make it a little easier to screw on and off. The brushed steel caps really look better than the colored cap when actually on the bottle.. I'm happy to finally have this (especially since it's a personally monogramed!). It's been a long wait and would have been easier with better communication. Sorry, Las Vegas. I was towards the 1st half of the mid-que backers. They are really nice solid flasks though. @dono are you living in America? Well, tweeted the following to the Fred account: '@fredwater Hi. Kickstarter backer here. 4 months with leaking bottle, 3 since you said you'd fix. No response to messages. Can you help? Let's see what happens... Well, tweeted the following to the Fred account: '@fredwater Hi. Kickstarter backer here. 4 months with leaking bottle, 3 since you said you'd fix. No response to messages. Can you help?' Let's see what happens... Try twitter to @ArielBroggi. He is a founder of Fred, and his account is still active. If enough people pester him we may get some sort of response. Has anyone experienced the freed up resources to communcate with backers in a way that's informative that started today? Chill everyone. I got my flasks in today. They are straight legit! No leaks. No cap issues. The quality is sick! These are sturdy and well worth the wait. They don't taste any different from my other cheapo aluminum water containers. Chill guys. Thou will be satisfied! Still waiting for my flasks. According to your USPS shipping status, it is in Transit since July. :( Have you shipped to Singapore? I waited so loonnngggggg for the two bottles. So long overdue... :( Well I would also be glad to hear about the status of my two flasks. My number is #4467 and no flasks yet here in Slovenia. Hope to hear from you. Great - you have a customer service contact for us. I was emailed a tracking number that never showed any information and my flask did not arrive. How do I best communicate to get this sorted and understand if it was shipped and lost OR was never shipped. Just getting dehydrated and want my flask! :-) I look forward to hearing from you - Thanks So I'd the shipment go is the shipment going out Monday and Tuesday the last flasks for people that haven't received a flask? Just to let you know from past experience I'm not going to hold my breath for a reply as you've let us down on nearly everything you said you would do in past updates and comments. Man, I feel bad for everyone else, seeing as I'm backer #154 and haven't received so much as a response! I also think anyone who has not received, will be lucky to get a thing. Fred have given up. My guess is they went crowdfunding, as banks wouldn't lend to them, due to their shoddy professionalism. Their last connection is October 31st. I think they completely abandoned us ... Really disappointed. Ignoring their backers and couldn't come up with a good answer about their lame communication. What a shame Fred, you can do better, but you screwed it up. "We are noting every complaint and preparing those to receive shipment if they did not. 100% of the backers will have their pledge." Sounds like Fred Water is only going to fulfill orders now for backers that raise a complaint. Fulfillment seems random and arbitrary, and it seems that they have no idea who they still owe orders to. I'm guessing we're not going to get any more updates and those of us that haven't received any of our order are going to be out of luck. Hi Fred Water, Any chance of an update? Alex ~ trying to be respectful and considerate ~ I just read the bio's of the founders.... Emmy award winning writer? Communications Development? High concept communications that shift the way people think about a category. I don't really care about the delay as long as I am made a part of the journey. For an Emmy award winning writer that shouldn't be too difficult. On the other hand... My thoughts about this product have shifted. From "Nice product" to "I don't really care anymore". I'l just give it another month or so. First Kickstarter...had better experiences on other crowdfunding sites. HI Fred, it would be niche to get an understanding of where you are up to and when you will be shipping to Australia?? From the comments it looks like you are having quality issues?? can you please at least send an email to inform why we are still waiting on shipment?? FINALLY....received the four I ordered. Blue one doesn't wobble when placed on a flat surface. Two stainless ones and one white one...have the wobbles. The cap fit is...okay, doesn't leak. But not the smoothest tightening action. Not really worth the cost or wait. Especially the wait. Drink on. @Fred Water Hoping for another status update this month... Will international see these before Christmas? How many backers remain? What's your fulfillment rate per week - 50, 100, 500? Why are people receiving incorrect colours, and what should we do if we're not satisfied with what we get? Please respond. Hi, please can you tell me where my flask is - was an early backer, ordered months ago.... in k green. I am never crowd funding anything again. My first and last time. Good bye. Still waiting for my 2 flasks here in Australia..... Got my Fedex tracking email just now. They should be delivered here in Las Vegas by Monday. Almost ready to exhale. Also still waiting. Have not received a tracking code for delivery or response to my message sent about a month ago. Any news? Still waiting for 2 bottles in Australia Dear Fred Team, can you tell when delivery to Germany is scheduled? Still waiting for my two white flasks. Thanks, Best Jan Didnt get my two yet either... I have recieved my flasks, however not the colors I ordered. I ordered KS green, 1 silver, 1 black and 1 OD green. I got the KS green, but the rest were silver. This happen to anyone else? I'm just gonna keep the silver ones as they are still super cool. Just wanted fred to be made aware. This is just another complaint about not receiving the backed bottles, not getting informed about the state of production or shipping or whatever someone could be informed about. Other projects have problems too, but they inform. I get weekly mails from other projects I backed, where people describe their problems shortly and what they are doing. This is all I want and expect. It costs them about 10 minutes of work. It seems, as if these 10 minutes are too much time, that Fred could spent on their cash-cows, formerly known as backers. Same here in sg not received yet @Peter Ng Same (Singapore) No rewards received :\ (Singapore) Ordered 4 Flasks at the Beginning of this Project. Nothing. No Flasks, no Trackinginformation. No Update. Very disappointed here in Germany. A refund would be the best solution. Still heard nothing... no emails, no tracking codes, no nothing. Still waiting in Germany :( I made the contribution at the beginning and still has not reached anything, does not respond to my messages, it seems to have fallen by the contributions without sending product. I finally got mine after weeks of pestering. I think they just wanted me to stop. Anyways, I have not had an opportunity to fully test them, although the kickstarter green color flask came with a nice dent in it. Its quiet obvious when you look at it, so their "QC" methods are definitely lacking. If that is their excuse for not shipping or not responding, its not a good one. Looks like Fred don't even log on anymore to take note of problems. I wonder when they will bless us with their presence next. ordered 4 at the beginning of the campaign. no sing of the flasks here in austria. Schade, sehr schade. Ordered 5 in the UK, no sign, no response to message. Poor show verging on crooked. I think, given the circumstances, that constitutes being respectful and considerate... I got my two light blue flasks today in New York City. They are beautiful and well made. They do not leak. I am happy to have them but I hope the makers take the comments about keeping the backers better updated to heart. 11 months was a long time to wait. Just got my shipment of 4. Got a stainless instead of the Kickstarter Green and 3 lanyards instead of 4. At this point I'm not going to bother trying to send it back to get the right color. Hello from Russia, didn't get my flask yet. No sign of ours in the UK, have emailed. Nothing here yet. Any update in shipping? @j anderson, my kickstarter cred is nowhere as impressive as yours. However, I think there's a difference between keeping silent vs raising expectations and making promises, then nada. I have not had an experience so far about stuff coming smoothly, btw, but the fact that developers had good sense to connect with backers, made the experience much better. No flask here in London. No update. Nothing. @J Anderson, extremely well said!! No tracking number. No flask. No comms. I just got mine today - and they were worth the wait! Two stainless, one white and one masala. I'm wishing I didn't get the masala - but that's my fault - I didn't get the color. All four are laying on my counter, filled with water and on their sides. I put paper towel down to spot any leaks. No initial leaks. Each flask came with two extra rubber disks that help prevent leaks - and two caps that have disks pre-installed. The colored flasks have one color, one stainless cap. If they don't leak, then I am very very happy. They are amazingly attractive. My only wish is that Fred (the company) had assigned someone to this for the duration of the project who is a better communicator. Quite honestly, I can see the effort when I look at the product, but nobody 'took us on the journey'. For those of you saying lack of communication is some giant calamity that put you off Kickstarter - check my profile to see all the campaigns I have backed. I have had good and less good experiences, but I like it overall. This isn't for everyone. There is ambiguity and change. If you want certainty than you should browse Amazon, or even Etsy, not here. Hi there, it's 1month +1 day. Has put me off crowdfunding. Why should people risk their money, however large or small an amount, to help people start out, then get treated as if they are in the wrong asking a question, or not being happy with the product? Stick your flask up your arse FRED, I believe the design will help that happen, but it will probably leak while its up there. I am frustrated by Fred Water. I have informed them of the leakage problem since August 2015 but neither a practical solution is provided nor my request for refund is ever responded. Regret to be a backer of this project!!! Got my four today. Not terrible, but far from great. Really disappointing for the money spent and the time wasted waiting for them. To be totally honest, these will probably sit on a shelf unused until I pitch them when someone like hydroflask makes a significantly better product for the same price or less. Still no tracking number here for Ireland or a flask for that matter. No reply to any messages either. Who will they blame for this delay? Backer 273 - just got a tracking number! Woot! No new updates, no emails, no tracking codes, no nothing. Still waiting in Italy. It's been almost a year, guys. What's the deal? Still no flasks in Texas?! The update submitted a month ago said that all US flasks had arrived. What's the issue? Still no flasks or news here in London. Feel utterly disappointed. Come on Team Fred - what's going on? @FRED WATER, any updates regarding international shipping? No white flasks in Germany yet. Glad to hear from you. Best Jan FRED WATER FRED WATER Aug 21 2015 Report spam Hi David, Thank you for checking in. We did receive returns and we did have some backers who either did not provide their address or their address changed. We will check our shipping records and send out your flask after confirming there was no issue. Expect your flask if Army Green, Charcoal and/or Brushed within the next 10-14 days. We appreciate your patience. This project is almost to completion. - The Fred Team Left two messages since no response. No flask. Not good. @Fred almost a month ago you said the rest of the balance was there.. .. any update? anything? hello? *cough* is this thing on? Nothing arrived here in Udine, italy......and I am also worried about all quality issue i read on so many comments...... Still no bottles in Scotland and no replies to e-mail I would like a refund because this has certainly not a good Kickstart for us who have pledged our money. Thanks. Hey Guys, I was shipped a batch of 2 bottles about 2 weeks ago and it looks like they're defective. The threading on the bottles seems to be the main problem. With the colored (non-fred) caps, I can only successfully apply the lid 1 in 10 times (the threading is misaligned and leads to the cap screwing on sideways). With the taller fred cap, I can apply the cap more regularly 1 in 2-3 times, but it takes a lot of force to screw the cap and that's causing the lid to sheer and become sharp and jagged. Having used my sister's fred flask (which arrived about 2 months earlier), I can see that this is not the intended design. You can basically 'flick' her cap closed, and the cap goes on straight. So it looks like this is clearly a defect. I love the concept of the product, the design is sleek and minimal, but the flask isn't really functional right now. I bought colored flasks (marsala and blue), but I'm wondering if you'd help to facilitate an exchange for even the brushed steel flasks...just something with working threading so that I can use your product (which I most definitely still am hoping to do!). In New York and still waiting for my flasks or at least some updated information on when I can expect them. No delivery in Ireland yet. And no communication on when to expect it either. @Alex Elderfield. Yes, I've received two plain steel flasks. Of the four included caps, we managed to get two to fit. Unfortunately one of the bottles leaks from the cap. Two months ago, Fred promised to send me new washers that will apparently solve the problem. They've never arrived, and Fred have stopped responding to any communication. So I'm stuck with a flask I can't use. At least the one I got as a gift for someone actually holds water. @Alex Elderfield. Yes, I've received two plain steel flasks. Of the four included caps, we managed to get two to fit.

I understand the difficulties...and am willing to wait but communication with your Kickstarter backers is really important so we know what's going on! Please update FAQS or comments so we know when/if to expect delivery...Fred is a cool company...stay that way! Anyone got a stainless steel unpainted flask yet? Any deliveries to the UK yet? One of the Indiegogo campaigns I'm backing is 18 months behind, so Fred is almost bang on by comparison. How do I find out if I'm getting a replacement for a poorly made bottle? I talked to someone a while ago and emailed pictures, but never got any replies after that. Any updates for Singapore color and silver flasks? Still haven't gotten them... it's been soooo long. Hopeless in Holland....?! Finally after all this time, and patience, I received my Fred water bottle and... it leaks. I was under the impression they fixed and because they had to fix it is why it took so long to receive, apparently I was fooled. What a waste of time and money. Terribly disappointed! Clearly this company is founded by dicks if not thieves....no reply to my emails nor request. I hope the company fails as well as you are ruined financially. You shouldn't call yourself human beings....garbage is a proper name. Nov 6 is the wedding date for a close friend, she is really jittery, and no, I am not going to give her a flask to help calm her down. It's just that the date is drawing near, and it's 1 month since your update of - flasks are here.. sending out.. soon.. Creator, ordered 5 flasks - have seen none. Any update?? Still waiting in Holland for an orange one (ofcourse). Got an email in august that my flask was triple QCed. So I expect it to be flawless... :) When we get it I am sure it will be a wonderful product. But no reply to emails, no shipping date, no tracking number. Has anything got out to Europe yet? Look forward to the delivery. Canada. Nope. Waiting in Canada. Received a tracking number at the end of April. No movement. Same no flask no tracking no email no follow up. And u blame the Chinese!!!! Ohh please！！！ No flask. No tracking. No f.a.q. I wonder how they will blame the Chinese manufacturer for the delay in shipments or will they pass the buck onto the fulfillment partner. No flask, no shipping info, nothing. In Menlo Park CA, what's the deal Fred? In Canada. No flasks, no email... Still waiting... Have not received mine, msg them on the 18 Oct, still no response Have not received mine yet @Brandon Walton Totally agree with you. No flasks here. (Canada) any update please. Has anyone in Canada received their? I haven't received my 2 nor an update with a tracking number. Any update. So I finally received my 2 flasks (I ordered before XMas in 2014.) I was happy to get mine finally - thanks for that guys. However, THEY LEAK LIKE A SIEVE! The entire contents leaked all over my car seat. Not so happy guys. Can you fix????? @Nick Diamond The main issue is the lack of communication. We were promised an FAQ, and never got one. Why not? I tried for weeks to speak with someone at Fred about shipping and the FAQ and was ignored. I even contacted their PR team via the website, still nothing. I understand they were working to ship products but how hard is it to come on here and let us know what was going on? Even in their recent updates here, they still don't offer an apology. They keep repeating they are working to ship and fixing QC issue. That's all well and good but, any good business would have just posted a quick apology to those of us who have tried to contact them and have been ignored. I don't need an individual apology, just a quick; "Hey Guys, we know we've been a little MIA, and for that we are sorry. To those who have been trying to contact us, we have gotten your messages but we simply don't have the manpower to reply to all of them individually. Trust us we are working to get your flasks to you ASAP. Also, as for the FAQ we dropped the ball, please see the completed FAQ here for all of your needs." Again, we are truly sorry and we are working diligent to get you your flasks as promised. Had I seen something like this, I would have respectfully waited and not pestered them or posted here. This could have been a blanket apology across all their social media platforms and would have taken them 10-15 mins tops. Creating that FAQ might take them 30mins. They stated they are noting every complaint, but what does that mean to the backers? I don't care how innovative you are, the lack of communication and disregard for your customers would not take you very far in most industries. I have yet to receive my orange flask....when can I expect it? they made good on their response and replaced my defective one. new one is much, much better. thanks Fred. Thank you Fred/Creator! I will hold tight. I am sure my friends will enjoy presents from me at any date! Hello, I was wondering if there is any updates on shipping to Canada? I never received mine and am curious. Thank you, great project by the way. I received my flask, it looks great! However, it has a small crack in the neck of the flask and leaks. I've sent an email but so far have heard nothing back. @Matt I've heard nothing from them but believe I'll get what I paid for when they feel the quality of product is achieved. If they come out and say "sorry we f'ed up you're all at a loss" I'll worry about that then. Surely if you did something this innovative for work your boss wouldn't fire you promptly when you ran into unforeseen issues while operating on a shoestring budget with limited personnel. I doubt Nicola Tesla had 2000 angry $100 backers breathing down his neck during his countless setbacks. Still have not received our flasks... Is there an ETA on shipping to Australia? 1x light blue and 1x black. Tired of waiting. @Nick Diamond I don't think that it's unreasonable for people to expect what they have been promised. If offline you have received emails promising something it it not being fulfilled, you'd likely feel the same. While we all understand there are obvious troubles in manufacturing a new product, if we were told "sit tight, they will be coming and are delayed because X, y, and/or z" verses "we will ship the color alternative next business day" (over two months ago), you'd likely feel the same. This is a very clear case of awful expectation management by FRED. I'm not sorry that I hold people to their word and comment when they have not only failed that but then ignored future correspondence. If I did this in my job, I'd be fired promptly. My flask finally came!!! But, it has a big dent in the side :( did anyone else have this issue? Thanks for the update FRED. Crazy to me how inpatient some folks are. Some comments appear more like that of an angel investor that's sunk 200k into a project rather than $40-$200. I feel like this is the water bottle equivalent to SEALS 'Hell' week and every time someone demands a refund it's just another sad soul ringing the bell. It would appears FRED's more focused on getting the job done than replying to 2'000+ emails. Sounds like resources are going to the right places to me. Two creative people can only waste so much time sending us the same news... Stay strong & hold fast KS backers! When the dust settles the FRED team might finally be able to get some well deserved rest and we the backers will surely all be well hydrated, in style no less! Sup Fred, Backer #1860 here. I guess that would put me somewhere in the first half. Still awaiting 1 Army Green and 1 Marsala flask. Just a heads up. Thanks. Backer #89, UK. Fred, the question is when? I got this message back on the 17th of July 04:10 a.m. White, estimate is shipping to you within 20 days. White had to be made again as we rejected many in qc before shipping to us. So sorry, but we promise it will be worth it. - The Fred Team You kept on promising. Please cut the C*%p and give an option for refund please? Doesn't look like Fred has managed many of the obligations below. When a project is successfully funded, the creator must complete the project and fulfill each reward. Once a creator has done so, they’ve satisfied their obligation to their backers. Throughout the process, creators owe their backers a high standard of effort, honest communication, and a dedication to bringing the project to life. At the same time, backers must understand that when they back a project, they’re helping to create something new — not ordering something that already exists. There may be changes or delays, and there’s a chance something could happen that prevents the creator from being able to finish the project as promised. If a creator is unable to complete their project and fulfill rewards, they’ve failed to live up to the basic obligations of this agreement. To right this, they must make every reasonable effort to find another way of bringing the project to the best possible conclusion for backers. A creator in this position has only remedied the situation and met their obligations to backers if: they post an update that explains what work has been done, how funds were used, and what prevents them from finishing the project as planned; they work diligently and in good faith to bring the project to the best possible conclusion in a timeframe that’s communicated to backers; they’re able to demonstrate that they’ve used funds appropriately and made every reasonable effort to complete the project as promised; they’ve been honest, and have made no material misrepresentations in their communication to backers; and they offer to return any remaining funds to backers who have not received their reward (in proportion to the amounts pledged), or else explain how those funds will be used to complete the project in some alternate form. The creator is solely responsible for fulfilling the promises made in their project. If they’re unable to satisfy the terms of this agreement, they may be subject to legal action by backers. Does anyone get a collected message on their projects? I noticed that this was marked collected, but of course, I am like almost everyone here, still waiting. who wouldve ever guessed some flasks could cause so much grief I'm not terribly upset, but the comment from Fred/Creator about identifying those who haven't yet received worries me. When we were given the option of quicker non-painted flasks months ago I jumped at the chance. I didn't respond soon enough, and the Fred team told me I would have to wait. Now I don't know if a) they think they sent me all-metal/non-painted ones to me (I ordered 4), so I'm SOL and will get nothing, or b) I will get the original colors I requested, c) I will get all metal/non-painted, or d) some other random option. More than anything I find the not knowing to be annoying. Dear Fred Team, Do you honestly think this response is at all satisfactory? Creator FRED WATER about 13 hours ago "Coolbee333 and others. We have returns and we're going through data to id who did not receive. We will be sending out replacements and those not sent this week." This is actually more insulting, that you cannot apologize for being so shitty and disinterested in our concerns. YOU stated WE would get tracking numbers/our products in a certain amount of time. YOU never posted an FAQ as you promised. YOU have ignored, emails, messages, posts, etc to some many backers. YOUR customer service is atrocious. YOU will never see anymore of my money for your products. When/if my flasks arrive I will thoroughly test them, and if there are ANY issues I will go out of my way to make sure you hear about it. Sincerely, The backers you screwed!!!! Pledge for multiple flasks in the first 3% of backers (#154) and haven't even gotten a response to messages, let alone any flasks. Please look into this and fix the defect I have been experiencing of my flasks not even existing. They don't carry much water in their current state... Although, on the plus side, they do currently fit pretty much anywhere and I haven't had any issues with leaks! Hi. Three weeks after update 31 - no flasks. I've also emailed you again. Almost a whole year without a single response to any email I've sent to you. Can someone please get in touch or update me on the latest delay thats out of your control... Still waiting for mine. From Singapore. I've been using my flask for almost two weeks now, and I really like it! I thought the flask shape would work well in my bag, but I underestimated the value of being able to put it in my back pocket. Really handy. No issues with quality and I love the light blue color. Worth the wait. Hopefully I'm on the list as still waiting for my two flasks. Hope it's true this time. REALLY THIRSTY. Blah blah blah Fred. Heard it all before. You just lie constantly. Ignoring messages, ignoring comments, ignoring backers. Keeping backers updated is soooooooo GODDAMN HARD, right Fred? Backer #695 Germany. Glad my 4 funded Flaks did not arrive yet. Quite a shitty kickstarter project! Would prefer a full refund! Exhausted when they are going to arrive. Will be a pleasure to create a YouTube Review and a blogpost how shitty this company is in terms of communication and service. Stay tuned! Hi Fred, any news regarding international shipping of white flasks? Summer is over, Christmas is heading ;-) Thanks for a short notice, Best Jan Still no flask or tracking and still no communication from Fred. I wish I had never backed this product at this stage. All I wanted was a flask but I'm not too hopeful anymore. Edit: two months later and no delivery or shipping info. I got an email quite a while ago (8/27) about if I changed my color then they would ship it "the next day". It's now almost two full months later. Must have shipped it via USPS. I'd frankly just take a refund now and rather go buy a round bottle that fits in my backpack holder. Kickstarter needs a policy to handle crap like this. Also no FAQ as promised. No shipping info as promised. I have an acronym that you guys can use for free: FRED - F**king Ridiculous Extended Delays. I give up on the project and spending any more mental energy on it. From Fred"With over 100 years of design, development and production experience under our team's belt, we are confident with this timing, plus or minus two weeks. We have managed out the unknowns to the best of our abilities, but as people who care deeply about the things we make, we will communicate with you throughout the process so that you know exactly when to expect your shipment." Hopefully you were genuine when you wrote this. But the reality has not lived up to the hype. Flasks in your hands over 3 weeks ago and still no word. Ironically your fulfilment partner is called Pride. Surely nobody has any Pride in this crap communication. My flasked has arrived. Well, when I say arrived, it's invisible, and got delivered in an invisible box, by an invisible carrier pigeon. Not tested the invisible washers yet, but the build quality seems, invisible. I have a tracking number saying its on its way in a email. Sorry, no, my mistake, that was an email confirming what a mug I am thinking it's ever coming. Off to buy a water bottle from a local shop, unless they have a list of 3,000 excuses why they have none in stock. China running out of Cargo ships delivering plastic bottles, the clouds not having any water, or a key snapped off in the shop door, all perfectly reasonable excuses to have nowadays. Received my two bottle sets (light blue and orange). I am just glad to have them. Caps take some work to align threads and screw tight. One bottle leaks from the cap. I haven't doubled-up on the seals yet. Filled them both with lemon juice and water and left them over night. I cannot detect a "metal" smell, but will fill them and see if they add a "metal" taste to the water. I have a ZERO water filter so I if any odd taste is detected, I know if came from the bottle(s). Fingers crossed they do what they are supposed to do which inspire me to drink more water. Waiting for mine:-( Ten days since my last message to them. They've ignored previous messages. They've been promising to send out washers which will allegedly stop my flask from leaking for over three months now. Honestly, I think they're just cutting their losses, chucking whatever flasks they have out of the door in order to fulfil outstanding orders, and washing their hands of the whole thing. Clearly the manufacturer wasn't up to the task, and it looks like Fred have been somewhat overwhelmed trying to deal with the high demand coupled with high failure rates. It'll be a nice surprise if the washers arrive, and an even nicer one if they work, but I'm not holding my breath. However, dealing with it by hiding and ignoring communications is pretty pathetic. @arthur Jara, me! Backer# 89 white, UK Still got no info nor product. Still no flask, still no response to email. Just sit and wait cause Wez at the casino trying to double up��� How does one get a refund? I am sick of waiting. Looks like I'm one of the unfortunate ones that received a defect. Cap screws on like a square in a round peg hole - haven't even tried to put water in it yet... so disappointing after waiting over 10 months to receive. Emailed them earlier in the week...but nothing back. I've backed 22 projects so far and this has been the worst. So after a good week and a half of pestering them, I got a response when I sent a message through Kickstarter and called them out that I saw they were logging in but not responding. Here is the message I received word for word on Oct 19th. "Your flasks are in a small batch set for final shipment. We have some folks w scratches on the bottles so we are qcing them in the states during shipment. Expect within a week." -The Fred Team I am not holding my breath. Am I the only one who has yet to revive their stainless steel flask? recieved my blue flask in nor cal. nothing wrong with it at all, feel pretty satisfied with the quality Still no word on when these will be delivered and no FAQ. So happy I was excited enough to order 8 of these. I hope the long wait means I won't get one of the defective ones so many people are complaining about. The least you could do is put up the FAQ that you promised in the last update a couple of weeks ago. That doesn't seem to be such a big promise to deliver on but at least it would be somewhere to go for answers now that you are 'winding down 1:1 communication'. So how can we get in touch with FRED. I received my flask but it's wrong color. I don't even want to unpackaged it cause I'm sure someone out there is waiting on a white one. LMK. Waiting for my flask in Winnipeg, Canada. No tracking number, no nothing. It would be nice to get an update since I paid for two bottles and have received nothing in the slightest, not even an email.... No tracking number still and no answer in the F.A.Q. Why am I not surprised. This user's account has been deleted. I'm with you Brandon. I pledged Nov 26 2014, still waiting. My guess is if you've left a comment then yours ships last. No clue if or when it'll ever show up. Christmas 2016? HoHoHo! I have tried contacting the folks at Fred Water via email, phone, Facebook, Instagram, Kickstarter, etc for over a week. Not one response, not one acknowledgement, nothing to let me know that they have received my question and are working on a resolution. At this point, I have complained so much that I won't be surprised if they don't send me my flasks out of spite. All I wanted was an update, or tracking number. If someone knows of a better way to get an answer please let me know. This is beyond frustrating and very unprofessional. Tim Husted, Apparently there are two rubber thingies that you are supposed to use. See the youtube video here. <url>"tracking numbers," whining about the timelines, and all the other same questions over and over and over and over... Kickstarter should do something about that, it isn't constructive, and it is super annoying.) Received my light blue flask yesterday. No leaks, so seems like Fred worked out the kinks. The caps don't screw on completely smoothly, but it's not a big deal. Looking forward to using it! Still no tracking number. Still waiting to receive a tracking number for my blue bottles. Can you update, please? Pledged Nov 26 2014 Estimated delivery Jan 2015 Funded Dec 31 2014 Maybe by this Christmas? You talked about FAQs a week ago, still no FAQs. I still have not received a tracking number. When should I expect that? Is there a way to contact someone—as my previous request for a refund over a month ago was completely ignored? Not happy about receiving only two of my three flasks. I sent a message via Kickstarter but assume I will be ignored again. Wish I had never backed. Wish I had received a refund. Wish we were all treated better. Backer #1741, just received my KS green flask today, near Seattle WA.(roughly 11 months since I put in my support). No leaks, stands tall and the color is totally ****'. I'm pretty patient with ks sponsoring and I think others should realize you are getting in at the ground floor on an R&D project, which means these folks and others like them are working their arses off to succeed. Some simply don't do it and they fail, I admire them for trying and for the opportunity to share in their passion and dreams. Some teams don't communicate well, like some human beings, and I understand some people don't deal well when their sense of urgency isn't related to others. Oh well! I sponsored another really well known ks- some thing 'bout a really cool cooler - took nearly 15 months for that team to make it right, probably the only real difference was more frequent updates and pics and videos of progress. Might be a lesson in there for fred and the team but hey I wish 'em the best. Thanks for a really cool product that I like a great deal and look forward to using a long time. Cheers, BEEZ What backer # are we on, anyone that has received? #154 less than 2 hrs from Pride. Nada. Fingers crossed I'll hear something soon. Yesterday I received the blue and brushed I ordered. After reading the comments for the last few months I was very worried about receiving bad flasks. I'm happy to say I have no issues with these and the quality is great. <url>"Next time you drop by to write a comment. Why don't you take some more to answer your messages ?" Why don't people take the time to read the answers they have given to the same question over and over again? Kickstarter isn't meant to be a click and get thing, you are an investor in an innovative project and need to take the lumps as such. Another Kickstarter project I backed is over a year behind schedule, and they basically have nothing to show for it. (The factory they were working with simply couldn't come through, so they had to find a new one.) The people whining about Fred would be TOTALLY flipping out if they backed that one... Dear Fred, I want my money back. I've lost interest in waiting for your leaky, poorly constructed product to arrive at my door. Thank you for ruining Kickstarter for me and thousands of of the backers you duped into supporting you. Next time you drop by to write a comment. Why don't you take some more to answer your messages ? Next time you drop by to write a comment. Why don't you take some more to answer your messages ? Pictures?? Don't know why getting an update is so hard. GIVE US AN UPDATE! ANY INFORMATION WOULD BE NICE!! I am a bit frustrated like everyone else. I bought three bottles. I don't have anything and all the updates are showing expected delivery was end of August. It is now October. I really would like to get what I paid for please. I think we are long overdue for an update on this project. I still haven't received my blue flask and it seems like the project creators have gone silent. Hey 3 messages later and I still haven't gotten a bottle or a response on my last 2 messages. Whats going on guys? I have sent you several message but did not receive any response from you. Much regret to back this project. Hi there, looking for an update on the 2 white flasks backed/ordered. Thx! And the status in customs is............ Still waiting. Hello I ordered many different colors and the steel I have not received anything so far please let me know what to do next Hi. Haven't received my flasks. Be great if I can get an update please? Cheers Ben I received my flask in July. Noticed it leaked, the cap didn't look right when on. Send an email on your site and twitter, heard nothing so far Nice update Fred! Help. I'm completely lost now. Nothing received, no emails, no flasks. Still waiting on two flasks. Please please please contact me. @eddy o'neill. The washers must have arrived, as on the 27th of August, Fred messages me to say 'we're sending some to you today'. That said, nothing has arrived yet, so I'm assuming they've gone astray in the post. Frustrating, as I've had my flask since the 18th of July, and haven't been able to use it. Hi Fred, i backed two white flasks, can you tell a delivery Date? It seems Im one of the "5" that doesnt received his yet. All the Best Jan Groovy The seals provided by the company do not prevent leakage and I subsequently asked for replacement seals or another solution. Despite the company said the new seals would be delivered to me soon, nothing has been received so far. The company even ignored my email enquiries in the last few weeks! Adam, Can you at least send out an email to everyone to confirm the status? Maybe if we had some reassurance that you still know you owe us a flask then we'd back off. 10 months and not a single email. Just a blanket, 'They're coming'. You don't instill confidence. i HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY FLASK AND CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT THE HOLD-UP IS... Please reassure us you haven't run off with our $ and the flasks are on their way!! Like many here, I'm still waiting for my stainless flask. Other than confirming my military address several months ago, I've heard nothing. Have the washers arrived? Is it really that hard to log onto kickstarter for 2 minutes and just give us a quick sentence of an update? I think not. Just looks like extremely poor customer service. I wouldn't mind the wait if you gave us a regular update. Washers were to arrive on the 11th and we are nearly 2 weeks passed that date now with no update. It took me about 30 seconds to type this during my working hours in my business so surely you could do the same. This user's account has been deleted. No water, no sugar...no Fred Water Flask... Can you please provide an update? Do you think I will receive my bottle before Xmas? I have sent message and no response, ordered 4 steel and have received nothing, please contact me ASAP, thanks How's it going! Just another backer waiting for my steel flask. I saw the message saying that if I hadn't received a steel flask I should contact you. Please help! I'm all for the message but it concerns me on how long this has been taking. Thank you This kickstarter is a joke. My first flask was defected, i couldn't lock the cap due to factory problem & it started to rust after only 2 weeks of use. I contacted Fred multiples times in 16 days , left comments there and never EVER had a response. So i contacted kickstarter staff to help me having an answer. After again multiples messages Fred finally answered me : "Adrien, You are receiving a new bottle, going out in the mail today, that is personally checked by our team. You will not have a problem with the new flask. - The Fred Team" Yes, they said "personally checked by our team. You will not have a problem with the new flask." Today, i received the new one, here's a couple of pics directly taken after opening the package : <url>"shortly" are not very comforting. Also a little disappointing that you don't man up accept responsibility rather than blaming the factory. Ever consider a simple sorry rather than more reasons or excuses. Just a thought. The is my last message and looking forward to this being over and hopefully "shortly". Best of luck with Fred, you'll need it. Respectfully, Dan why yall keep saying was supposed to be a christmas present when it wasnt even supposed to ship til like january /february originally smh Class action lawsuit for Kickstarter fraud? How about a comment on that Fred, you might be next. <url>"cheaper to export" manufacture to china? This seems to be a hard lesson learned by more than a few Kickstarts as of late. I can 100% believe your frustrations. Keep pushing team! Thanks for all your hard work! Ordered steel and orange. Nothing. Update would be nice with realistic delivery so im not hanging my head everyday walking back from the mailbox. good point. Wow, everybody ease up a bit. We didn't order these from Amazon. That other popular stainless steel bottle brand seals with a silicone o-ring. The only kind I can think of that doesn't use something like this is the Nalgene type plastic bottles. Product and process development takes time. Everyone wants to put out a schedule at the beginning that looks like best case and when problems happen it slips. Sometimes you can make it up somewhere else and sometimes you can't. We are also getting first production runs of product so there are bound to be problems with some. As long as they make it right we will all get a working awesome water bottle in the end. So until they say they have all the bugs worked out and good bottles are on the way relax. There are other Kickstarters that never delivered anything. i ask again ... why we even need washers? literally what the heck. a complete disappointment and not what i had in mind when i initially backed this project. From everything I've heard til now, I'll be surprised if I even can use this flask, should I ever receive it. I'm not even angry, it's just saddening. ps: love ur plastic bottles Imagine waiting for something that was promised, and there being no communication? Imagine sitting here waiting for something that you paid money for and no one stating these issues? Imagine being pissed about it.. We would be more lenient about this if you were there communicating these issues all along. I would rather wait for a flask that did not need a washer. One that the cap fit.. one that did not leak.. just communicate.. 2.7mm washer .. But you guys got the 1.5mm washer.. Pushing all those blames to the factory.. As I know if you have someone from your company to be at the factory to check everything this won't be massed up.. Maybe someone if not doing his or her part.. But anyways.... Where the hell is my flask!!! #2367 Has it been already send or spend?? Worst. Kickstarter. Ever. I got my first chrome flask about 2 months ago, still waiting on my second FRED, what's good? I haven't received a steel Fred flask yet, have they been shipped to the UK? I'm happy to wait, I read that they were already sent out so just wanted to confirm that mine is still undelivered. Thanks. Ok, Fred... It's been 3 weeks since you promised delivery in 2.5 weeks. Still no flasks and no additional news. Can you give us a status update? This is getting ridiculous. Any News?? Shipping to UK, EARLY BIRD SPECIAL FRED WATER FLASK (POWDER COAT COLOR) - Get your limited edition Kickstarter box which includes 1 Powder Coat Color Stainless Steel Water Flask (Choose from White, Charcoal, Army Green, Orange, Light Blue), 1 Extra Steel Cap, 1 Loop Lanyard, and 2 Foil Stamp Fred Stickers. STILL WAITING ON MY FLASKS. Only project that has not delivered yet out of all backed projects. Where's Waldo? NOPE- WHERE'S FRED? Upside down in a box of flasks somewhere outside of Shanghai, screaming about quality to some Chinese folks who don't speak Engrish... so you UHRDME! just heard from fred a couple mins ago. balance of color flask is going through another quality assurance. as soon as they done they go to fulfillment house to be shipped immediately. almost there thank u for u patience. expect flask within 2 weeks I did reach out on their Instagram and Twitter feed.. nothing.. .. @Gordon hahahah I just wonder if we are still going to get them.. LARGE FONT CAPITAL LETTERS AND EXCLAMATIONS !!!! When should the "early bird special" be receiving their flask? I pledges on 12/30/2014...with an expected delivery in January 2015!!! Don't you think that it is a little long? Would appreciate a swift response and an email with a tracking number...thanks Kickstarter Green Submitted: on January 5. HOW ABOUT IT FRED! Your communication is real weak! I dont care what excuse you give me your communication sucks! UHRDME! as well as two months before that and the preceding months too lol @Jesse I got the same message almost a month ago.... just hears from fred. they said they are expecting the remaining balance from the factory to the fulfilment house , rest of colors all shipped within 7-10 days... got this this morning My prediction, there will still be people in December waiting for their flasks. I would of loved an update about the further delay to the rest of the colours rather than having to gather news from other backers. Copied from August 12 update: Our new stated goal for the final batch is delivery out from our fulfillment house to you within 2.5 weeks. Copied: Fred von Stein 5 days ago From Fred Water, in response to asking what the status of my white flask is: Dear backer, As of this week, all of the color flasks (including Marsala, Orange, Kickstarter Green, White, Light Blue) are thru a third round of QA and will arrive to the states in approximately 10-12 days. As soon as they arrive, we will be packing them out and sending them out. Look for a KS Update in your email confirming this at that time. Thank you for your patience, we are almost there. - The Fred Team Should have received it by now. Now adding more time AGAIN. RE-FUND. RE-FUND. RE-FUND. RE-FUND. RE-FUND. RE-FUND. RE-FUND. RE-FUND. Just wondering have all the stainless steel ones been shipped out yet? And do you get a delivery confirmation when your flask is sent out? As I am yet to receive my flask... Hi there. Could you add me also to the list of backers with leaking Fred bottles? Adding a second washer helped but now it's harder to close the bottle. So if you have a nicer solution I would also appreciate it. Thanks. Besides this issue I really like my Fred bottle. Cheers. Pledge # : 3692 Color: (1) Kickstarter Green Backed project: Dec. 21st, 2014 Status: Still have not received flask Comment: According to the latest update posted, I should be receiving it on Saturday. In the mean time, I will quench my thirst with thanks to my Hydroflask. Can I just have a refund. Then won't ever need to come on here again. How do I go about claiming one? Bence, I guess I am still looking forward to getting my I guess I just got my money back from Fred, so yeah, this is the first time I can say thanks. Good luck for the others, I guess. Correction: ...tremendous to bring you back into our favor..... This project has proceeded to step over the line into the "W(hy) T F" did I back this project zone. I was so excited in the beginning. I had bought and enjoyed other Fred products many times. Now, that excitement has been replaced by potential embarrassment. Potential because I haven't received my colored, potentially-flawed, bottles yet. Then, to read that bottles purchased off of the website have been delivered before backers' bottles is atrocious customer relations. I don't know how you plan to rectify all the mistakes you've made throughout this project, but it will have to be something tremendous to bring us backers back into your favor. All us backers have paid for your tooling, jigs, and fixtures (many, many times over). You should have an efficient, high quality and paid-for production process by now. FRED, you have to get your ducks in a row or these "forever" bottles will forever leave a bad taste (pun intended) in your backers' mouths. This user's account has been deleted. Hey, seriously, what's wrong with you & communication ? it's been 14 days i send you multiples messages and YOU NEVER ANSWERED ! i received a faulty product and you don't even give a damn about it ? I won't surrender, i paid 40 bucks for an impossible to use item !!!!! "I've posted this copmment and sent it via private messsage to the team, NEVER got an answer.. I I guess I'll post it again till someone fix this faulty order : I've got problems with my flask, unfortunately, there is a factory problem on the flask itself : it's really really hard to turn the cap, it blocks at middle course cause the thread isn't correctly made. Second problem : i've got some rust points inside the flask after only 2 weeks of use... It makes the water smell and taste really bad... Fred, please fix this -.-" I can send you pictures or whatever else you ask but i want a refund or another bottle ! Hi, what is the best way to update our address? I updated my address on the Kickstarter survey and sent two messages but haven't gotten a reply. Five weeks ago I was told that replacement washers would be sent out that would solve my leaking flask issues. One week ago I messaged direct to ask whether they had been shipped. I've had no response to my message, hence trying to attract your attention here. I'm now six weeks in to a flask I can't use. Are the washers on the way, please? @Fred von Stein: Thanks for posting that, that helps with my query about my orange and masala flasks. Fingers crossed those QA processes have improved by now! From Fred Water, in response to asking what the status of my white flask is: Dear backer, As of this week, all of the color flasks (including Marsala, Orange, Kickstarter Green, White, Light Blue) are thru a third round of QA and will arrive to the states in approximately 10-12 days. As soon as they arrive, we will be packing them out and sending them out. Look for a KS Update in your email confirming this at that time. Thank you for your patience, we are almost there. - The Fred Team Fred. Don't send me private messages saying it's been sent and telling me how great you are. Because your just feeding me lies. I couldn't care less about your product now. I've posted this copmment and sent it via private messsage to the team, NEVER got an answer.. I I guess I'll post it again till someone fix this faulty order : I've got problems with my flask, unfortunately, there is a factory problem on the flask itself : it's really really hard to turn the cap, it blocks at middle course cause the thread isn't correctly made. Second problem : i've got some rust points inside the flask after only 2 weeks of use... It makes the water smell and taste really bad... Fred, please fix this -.- Hi Fred, I received an email that notice me you sent me the bottle via USPS First Class Mail Intl on 10th July, but the email came without tracking code. But now, 24th August, STILL NO FRED. Backer #1587 Fred, are you going to address feed backs on the quality of the product? Fred, when? Be respectful and considerate and ship the products to the people that are paying you for all this. Then find another line of work. Thank you. lol @Fred ... so when should we expect our shipment? Are the caps going to fit without leaking and without washers? p.s. Maybe if they hadn't spent too much money on celebrity endorsements and spent it on quality control instead they might not have all the problems with the flask that they are having now. Unfortunately it looks like the Irish summer has finished and guess what everybody? I haven't received my flask either. And the news from the comment below saying orders off the website are being fulfilled before our own stinks of bad company ethics. It's a pity because I had high hopes for this project. I am truly disappointed. My sister ordered the flask AFTER me, and ordered it from the website, not the kickstarter. That's supposed to be fulfilled after the kickstarters right? Nope. It got delivered a week ago, and me, the kickstarter backer, who donated twice as much, has yet to receive anything. This is getting ridiculous. I'm reasonable. I get that this product takes time to ship out, and there isn't a guaranteed date of delivery. I'm not upset about that. I was irked about the awful communication, but not enraged. But to have a non-backer receive a flask before me is unacceptable. It's the principle of the matter. I get that i may have had a color with delays, but regardless, you satisfy your BACKERS before you go appeasing new clientele. This is atrocious. I can't believe I've been made to feel so upset over a measly waterbottle. I hope some of you see this and it becomes known they're doing this. Not much of a way to punish that terrible product management besides bad press. I'll update in 6 months when no flask has arrived and the company has gone under for poisoning their users with lead. Maybe this is a blessing in disguise. Have not received my flask yet. However still stoked about it! Had to share that I found this neat trick to drinking water till it gets here... Out of cups! Who would have guessed. Still excited about the product on the real. Have not received my flask yet. However still stoked about it! Had to share that I found this neat trick to drinking water till it gets here... Out of cups! Who would have guessed. Still excited about the product on the real. Have not received my flask yet. However still stoked about it! Had to share that I found this neat trick to drinking water till it gets here... Out of cups! Who would have guessed. Still excited about the product on the real. Cela fait un mois que je m'en sers, c'est parfait, merci Fred ! I'm pretty sure mines are brushed steel. Haven't received anything yet No flask and I think mine should have gone out in the first group. Shipping was to an APO, but they're usually not this slow. Distinctly average... Lol Received my flask a week or two ago. It's distinctly average. It had scratches, scuffs and the threading on the cap is terrible. You have to really crank it on, awkwardly, at just the right spot, then after a few times of that you're left with metallic powder all in your mouth. Any water tastes like metal. Don't get you're hopes up if you've been waiting forever for this. If you'd only put as much effort into the product as your stickers, they're great. Unusable in my opinion. I have not received the flask yet. I do not remember the color I selected because it is so long ago. Can you please check and get back to me when can I expect to get the flask shipped out to me, and I guess I Have selected Charcoal. My email is <email> used for Kickstarter account as well Thank for support and confirmation I received my bottles, but only one came with a lanyard. I also didn't receive extra caps/washers, either. Please send these things for the 2nd bottle. Still NO water bottle and lack of communication of when it will be shipped. Not cool !!!! Very unhappy with this Kickstarter! I've got problems with my flask, unfortunately, there is a factory problem on the flask itself : it's really really hard to turn the cap, it blocks at middle course cause the thread isn't correctly made. Second problem : i've got some rust points inside the flask after only 2 weeks of use... It makes the water smell and taste really bad... Fred, please fix this -.- Still NO water bottle and lack of communication of when it will be shipped. Not cool !!!! Very unhappy with this Kickstarter! Hi Fred Team- I'm patiently waiting ... but forgot what colors I ordered... how do i check? Got my Fred water flask in the mail a few weeks ago. Build quality is exceptional! I've been using it daily at home. Strangely enjoyable little bottle. The form factor is interesting because it is not very stable vertically, but it is ultra stable horizontally. I can leave it horizontally on my nightstand and grab it in the middle of the night with my eyes closed for example. Pretty cool. However as an professional engineer I don't use this in public as people seem to assume that it isn't water due to the "flask" nature... Maybe I'm the only one drinking water out of this thing, but I love it! Definitely has increased my water intake :) I have had issues with all the campaigns I have backed however this is the one that will make me stop funding anything in the future. Very disappointed. Also to the people who are running this campaign are you associated with the FRED water that is already sold in flasks? So will this help fix the leaking issue:? or we will have to use the washers? Thanks for the update, I was thinking about it today and wishing that I had my flask. I am still waiting, so if you have any questions about the order let me know. Fred Pretty glad you did another QA review on these last ones, I'd much rather it take longer to arrive and be without faults than sooner and potentially have problems with it. Nice update, thank you. Excited for my marsala flask Please advise when you'll ship it!! Summer's almost over... � @Jared At least it's true. :) I received my charcoal flask about 3 weeks back, and am very impressed with quality. Worth the wait. Below are my notes on it. 1 - no leaks with one washer and no strap attached 2 - attach strap and add additional washer and no leaking either. 3 - attaching strap is great and handy For those of you that really need your 20-30$ back and dont like the delay, that sucks b/c this is a great flask. I am still waiting on my orange one and my roommate is still waiting on his as well. Patience is a virtue, also it is kickstarter which is no guarantees FYI. A new season of firefly will be out before this update at this rate :P @Bence that is the funniest thing I have read in a long time.. Congrats.. *slow clapping* This new update is probably the slowest one ever. Duke Nukem Forever and Chinese Deomcracy by Guns n' Roses came out faster than this, hahaha. :D Received my bottle (silver alu).. international user here. Wow... very very premium look and feel. Bottle is solid as well. No leaks here after some tests. Sending update now .... 11 hours ago lol. I'm starting to think that was a lie I'm sure they are, and have been, working on it for the past 8 months, but damn at least update us lmao. literally every comment is "update please" and nothing. I could understand if the company was just one dude with social anxiety who is now having a panic attack... but its not. It's a company, like a REAL company with bosses and stuff. Like someone who can point to someone and say "my job for you today type up some baloney for our annual kickstarter update". But do they delegate anyone to type something up? No, no they do not. They just leave curt little comments once a month to say how inefficient updates are , and how an update isn't going to get you your flask faster. Kind of a big F U to all the backers honestly. Hopefully this super late batch of bottles is late because they're actually fixing the leak issue and the QC process. really disappointed at the lack of transparency & updates. And after reading the updates, I'm really concerned about the quality of product we'll be getting - if we get anything at all. Gotta love Kickstarter... ...still not seeing the update they sent... anybody else see it yet. says "sending update now" 8 hours ago. hmmm weird Nope Jesse. They didn't put an update up yet! update didnt show for me yet. show up for anybody else ? Two months since the last update. It's really unexceptable.... "Close to receiving balance of bottles. Some day we will tell you what it's like to work with factories in China." What crap. Most of the items I own from high end electronics like my camera to my iPhone and iPad etc say made in China on them. You are hardly pioneering working with factories in China. Let me add my comment to the pile. Not updating your backers regularly is completely disrespectful. Get some integrity and deliver on what you promised. I have my 4 bottels but im really disapointed with the caps. The thread is just not right they just dont seal good and leak. i bought them for camp trips to rode along in my Backpack but i dont trust them anymore had lekkage spills. And im not a happy camper with these bottels and if just one leaked okay but its al four bottels and its all becouse The thread is just not right on the bottel and cap This user's account has been deleted. Please write an update, on the shipping and how you intend to solve the problem with leak. Adam & the rest of the Fred Water team, I pledged because your product looked amazing - and I've been equally impressed with your plastic bottles (which you have to start selling in Houston!) You've run into problems, we know. But I trust y'all to take your time and figure out how to get me the quality product you showed me last year. I'd rather wait a little longer than I planned, and get a great product, then get a POC delivered on time. Thanks for working so hard on this, and keep your chin up! Still nothing from downunder here in Australia, logged on to check if I'd misread the 'balance shipping soon' from 2.5 months ago but it appears not. Happy to wait another 6 months if it means the flask will be usable and not leak on delivery... ���� "With over 100 years of design, development and production experience under our team's belt, we are confident with this timing, plus or minus two weeks [...] we will communicate with you throughout the process so that you know exactly when to expect your shipment." I took this from Fred Water's Kickstarer Campaign page, under the "Risks and challenges" part. No further comment needed I guess. Writing a comment on this project without being rude is very hard. Not only the large delay, but especially your very poor communication are a damage to not only your, but also Kickstarters reputation. I would have expected updates on production and shipment at least once a week. Instead, I had to search through all those comments on your few posts (the last one is more than two months old) to read your weak excuses. Reading the comments to the project makes me think that I've made a huge mistake by investing in your product. Seriously: Is there any opportunity to get my money back? I received my flask a few weeks back and i've not had a huge chance to use it but from what I have it has worked well although I haven't used it to carry water any real distance so far. People mention washers and talk about receiving 3? My lids have the plastic covers inside them which I'm assuming are the washers but I didn't receive others other than the ones inside the caps, is this right? why should we even have to use washers. what the heck lmao @FredWater... still have not received my flask, a shipping number, or an update on the project status. Negligence to the backers can discredit or destroy platforms like Kickstarter, what a shame. Got my charcoal flask a few days ago. My expectations were low, considering the comments. I am fortunate enough to have received a bottle without a leaking cap - mine is leaking out of a pinhole in the weld. Product development sure is a tough undertaking... I received mine in Australia. Brushed metal. First impressions: -solid build due to its wall thickness -terrible internal welding -caps don't sit on the lid correctly (it's actually a task to get them on.) -leaks with 2 washers ( fine with 3 washers) So I thought that I would give it a go, before making any comments. After 2 weeks, the size/look/material is great. There is something majorly wrong with both caps. Either during the CADing stage or manufacturing. You actually need to play around to get the cap on, and once it is on, you need to smack it down to sit properly. The worst part is that psychologically, you can't use it without thinking it may or may not leak. For example, I put my Klean Kanteens in my bag. I'm assured that they don't leak. But with this flask, it's just not an option, as it may leak. The finish looks good, internal welding is terrible, metal taste still lingering around after multiple washes. Major issue with the caps. Due to the lack of feedback and updates I found myself putting the Fred water back on the shelf today and buying another brand. It sounds stupid but I thought to myself I'm going to buy at least my pledge value on other waters before I consider returning to Fred. What a shame that you could not update us. Hello, is anybody home? Has the entire project team been sucked into a black hole of some kind? An update would be nice. Where were the prototypes made? Like the ones in the video that were the result of lifetimes of research and the extreme sport celebrities got. I want one of those, and an update would be nice too. I can imagine the issues this project has faced have been hard on your company; I patiently await a quality Fred flask and some kind of update as to how you've been getting on since June 5. In the meantime I will continue to buy the plastic bottles, which are great. Thanks and best wishes - Jesse We are patiently apprehensive. Updates however redundant can curb hasty comments here. Not asking the Gods to come down from Mt. Sinai. Just it could help if you could Moses us up some stale updates. It is the dark ages for the Fred Water Flask backers. My last email update from Kickstarter on this project was 2/13/2015. No word and no flask since then. And I've been a FredWater customer for a number of years. Hugely disappointing. So here's a simple request: (1) Send us all updates at least monthly. (2) Fix the quality issues and send us the quality project that we were promised, that we supported and which we backed. This project is damaging the reputation of FredWater, which is very good water. Please note. Don't bring in or blame the China factories.. You want to cut cost on the productions and earn more. You can have ask your mates to do a QC (guilty control/check) before ship to U.S or to us KS owners. Omg does it leak? I didn't know skate boarders like to water their pants.. I can confirm that it leaks. Can't put it in bags because of that. Received my flask. Besides the delay, it's disappointing to receive such a poor quality product. The flask leaks, making it completely useless, and the stainless steal finish is marred with marks, stains, and scratches I can't clean. I have never received my flask and my name is even FRED! I am still waiting for my kickstarter green flask, seems like the wait is going to be eternal. Been a month since I received my first flask, still waiting on the second. Roughly how long more do we have to wait to receive the water flasks? ɪᴍ ғʀᴏᴍ ᴀᴜsᴛʀᴀʟɪᴀ ᴛᴏᴏ.. ᴡʜᴇʀᴇ ɪs ᴍɪɴᴇ!!!! Received my 2 silver Flasks in Australia a few weeks ago and they are awesome � very impressed! Still have not received my stainless steel flask. Really unbelievable at this point. The flask leaks. Any replacement? How to fix it? Or look.. Looks forward to hearing that story @FRED Yeees! Received mine this week and it's awesome!!! Thank you!!! Glad I'm not the only one without my bottles and wondering why the campaign creator can't send out updates. After this is resolved I'm deleting Kickstarter. Took the money and ran? The Fred Watet Flask is not only good for water. It's superb for cooling down liquids fast. Great for alcohol :P Ice cold spirits/wine/beer! No updates? Keyboard broken? I have had a tracking number since the end of April and haven't seen anything move yet. C'mon guys. Get it together. Team, Please contact me re: flask shipped to wrong address. I sent you an email about a week ago stating that you shipped to the wrong address. I have sent you 2 followup emails asking how this would be resolved. I still have not heard back from you. Please contact me at your ealiest convenience. Thanks! When are the flasks coming out? It seems like it's been forever. Has anyone received the colored ones yet? Also, approx 2 weeks for rest of colors and orders to ship. - The Fred Team tomorrow is two weeks.. any updates?? Thanks The flasks finally arrived in Switzerland! Caps are not the same size and one flask leaks. Flask looks good but not worth the wait and not very usefull when you have to carefully put the caps on the flask. I find it comical how averse they are to updates. And if everybody has the same questions it should make MORE sense to address it in an update. I kind of feel bad for Fred, all these irate backers and leaky flasks. but at the same time how hard is an update. lmao Two months since last update. Sent an email asking about status of my flasks. Ordered two. No response to email, no flasks, no shipping information. Update please. I stopped drinking water on June 5th (as of your last update). I'm really thirsty now. Help. August 4. Still no flasks or tracking number. Please please please provide some sort of update. Got my brushed early bird, but unfortunately both caps shipped with it leaks. :( Still haven't received my order yet. Whats the deal here? What percentage have you shipped? Only particular colors? When can the rest of us expect our orders? Time estimate: domestic and international? Some kind of information would be respectful and considerate. Still no flask. Would appreciate an update. Thanks! I had a leak with my Fred Flask. Seemed to be a problem with the bottom weld. Fred replaced it. Good communication and fairly quick replacement. Thank you. Just wondering when I'll get my flask? Hey, any updates on shipping? Received an update email 5 June, but it's nearly 2 months later now. Appreciate an update. Hello, I received my black painted flask several weeks ago. It looks great but the screw cap is not designed well. Mine does not leak, so at least it accomplishes that, however the metal on metal scraping sound it makes when screwing on and off is discomforting. Also, I believe screwing the cap on and off sands a fine layer of paint off, leaving a grainy taste in my mouth when I drink from the flask. As a precaution against paint or heavy metal poisoning I will no longer be drinking from the flask. I wish you hadn't done this because I like the flask. Please consider doing some research on screw tops; as I understand it this is not the first screw top ever to be developed. Best, Max My patience is officially over, damn thieves. I reported this project to Kickstarter. More pople should do the same. THIEVES!!! Tq. Finally for long awating list i got my first fred water. Its cool... Please refund to me! Delay a half year and sent a leak bottle to me?! My cap (the charcoal one) is no seal... but I saw your picture and it is seal. Sent email to you but no response!! Never trust Kickstarter! Backer #3714 Received. But item flawed. Dent in the neck which make it LEAK! Unusable! Hi FRED, Backer #4318, singapore. Received mine last week. One of the cap is slightly dented, the other perfect one leaks but with another washer in it, solved the problem. I don't mind the slight dent on the cap, its negligible. Overall design is great :) A little larger in size that i would have expected, it barely fits into my jeans back pocket with half of the bottle protruding out but i guess its probably due to Asian jeans sizing and any smaller would probably make it useless as it would require too many refills for a day's worth of water. Still trying to clear the steel "smell" from the water with the ways and methods posted, thats probably the only thing i didn't quite expect but thats my issue to solve. So many thanks to FRED Team for producing an amazing product :) you wouldn't be able to please everyone and there are boring ppl out there whom would just grab any chance to scrutinize others' doings so as to hide their own flaws. So don't sweat it, it did took longer than expected but ultimately the result is what counts. On a final note, the overwhelming comments must have swept you guys off your feet as communication is a little lacking throughout the production & shipping period. But we all learn from experience :) (i wouldn't go as far as calling it a mistake) Thanks again and look forward to your next creation Received mine this week. Great design and fits perfectly in my pocket! Horrible design. Cap leaks. Just received my Fred Water Flask in the Netherlands. Loves the design. Thanks! Hi, I just got my flask. It has the wrong colour lid (black flask with silver lid) and the lid doesn't even go close to fitting August 1st. No update, no reply, no flasks, no news, no tracking number...... Why is it so difficult for you to engage in a little customer service? Its the end of July and I still have not received my "Fred Water Flask" Stated I would receive in Jan of 2015 Not happy about this kickstarter!! Hello sir, i want to know why is my package departed to SG on JUL 15 and yet now it's back to LOS ANGELES ??????????? my tracking number is LZ632067022US. Please kindly advise. Thanks. Backer 504. Still no flask, no tracking number and no response to my two previous messages. All I ordered was a stainless flask. This is ridiculous. I was going to order some for me and my team if I liked them but I think this will be the only Fred product I ever purchase. Tervis bottles for the team it is. Getting anxious.....would of been nice for summer activities....now I look forward to taking it to school Seems like they mismanaged expectations pretty heavily and are paying the price, sending a mass update "did you receiver your flask?" Makes you expect it soon, guess that isn't the case. I received my flask. It leaks. @Tracy No they haven't. The rest of the colours should be arriving at fred in about a week and a half according to a pm response they sent me. Have all the flasks been shipped? I have not received the two i ordered. Thank you! Tracey Still waiting for my orange flask... Brushed flask arrived today in the UK, I messaged Fred about 2 weeks ago asking where my flask was and they then told me they didn't have my address. So I gave them my address and two weeks later it arrived. I am pleased to say the quality feels good and I count myself lucky with the cap fitting well and no leaks coming from the flask. I hope the quality lasts as ill be using it everyday Brushed and charcoal both arrived here in the UK, been using them a bity so here are my thoughts. The GOOD; Finish on both of the bottles good, both internally and externally. Both are leak free. Both have flat bottoms and stand up without issue. Feels like a quality product. The INDIFFERENT; Charcoal cap not logo'd. Both spare caps are brushed (so I have three brushed and one charcoal cap), only two spare seals for the spare caps. Was expecting a more matt finish to the charcoal rather that the "bright" black. The BAD; Bottle neck/cap thread design is terrible, often takes two or three attempts to get either of the bottles caps to thread straight. Communication after funding completed has not been great. I'm still waiting for my stainless and orange flasks...don't forget about me! Ok, I have to say thanks to Fred Water for getting back to me and helping me out! I really appreciate creators that take care of backers. July 28. No rewards or updates on shipping. Please let me know the status. Got my army green flask a couple of weeks ago in Canada and have used it on a couple of outings. My feed back is as follows: -great launch video but poor backer communication throughout entire length of the project as seen from feedback from the posts here - great choice of colours to choose from - overall size, look and feel of the flask is excellent - powder coat on my army green is better than I expected - nice design on the flask harness - comes in handy from time to time - I would agree with others on the thread design for the cap of the flask - while the low profile threads makes it nice to drink from, their design makes for a very awkward fit as you start to screw the cap on the flask - while ultimately it does work and seal nicely, no one I've handed it to has been able to screw the cap on the first time without considerable fiddling / work (I'd go back to the drawing board on this critical feature for the second round of production for Fred Flask 2.0 which would then make it a truly outstanding product) - I'd purchase a few more if they could improve on the cap design / fit - I'd give it an overall project rating of 'B' - still a fan, Fred! i am still waiting for mine as well. Its been that long i forgot the colour i ordered. I'm still waiting for my stainless and orange flasks...don't forget about me! sent an email about a cap that doesnt seal and a wobbly bottle but got no reply. is there a better way to contact you? My Water Flask arrived yesterday in Germany! It's absolutely awsome :D Everyone needs to show a lot more patience. This is a kickstarter project and they have hit obstacles along the way but it looks like they are delivering albeit slower (much slower) than they had hoped. However, by the sounds of it they are delivering and are delivering quality. I am still waiting for 4 flasks but I believe they will deliver and I would rather have the quality late than cheap and early! I still got nothing. When I get my flask? Received mine today guys! I'm in Melbourne Australia. :) Quality! I got mine!!!! Simply beautiful! Thanks :D :D Semi impatiently waiting on receiving my flask, no tracking info is a little frustrating. Perhaps they are shipping in waves and just did the one mass backer email? Got my green flask and gray flask a week or two ago. Cleaned them, and used them on my latest camping trip. Worked great, no leaks, look good. Total bummer that some people are having leak issues or poor fitting caps. Mine are perfect and worth the wait. Hi, folks. First, I have the flask that my daughter pledged for, and it is fantastic. Well worth the wait. However, I still haven't received the two that I pledged for. I've held off asking, because I know you're swamped with inquiries, but it's been almost a month since we got the flask she purchased. Can you give us any kind of update about the remaining shipments? Oh, and the black cap doesn't have the logo on top as shown in the campaign. Minor detail, but a bit disappointing as it would've looked sweet.. Got my steel and black flask today. It looks REALLY good! (even with a few scratches here and there. Though some weird imperfections are: the black one is a bit woobly when standing upright, caps are super weird and clunky to fasten: got 2 caps to fit each flask after using rubberwashers, but they seemed to fall out of place a lot of the times when unscrewing the cap, - and the two flasks came with a slight difference in accessories: only two rubberwashers (none came with the back flask), got 3 silver caps and 1 black. This is just my initial thoughts and impression though. Hopefully it will be awesome in use! ;D Got mine awhile back, it leaks at the seam. Sent a PM and got some feedback about sending a picture. Sent them a picture and video but never heard back. Sent a second PM, still no replacement for what I supported you to make. To bad, guess that cool video was the most important thing to you, not your backers. I don't like to complain, but it's been months without a response. Flask arrived earlier last week. It looks really good! Didnt know that drinking water could be so boss! Feedback for future improvements perhaps are: 1. A bit of a challenge to screw the cap 2. Wobbles a bit when stood upright For those who've yet to receive yours, I do hope you'll receive yours soon. Fred 'team'. You are Useless. Can you not see the comments on here, and just take it on the chin, you have messed up? Your past the excuses stage. You just seem out of your depth. Flask still yet to arrive. You did send an email saying it had been shipped with a reference number which never had any information. Disappointing. Can you help? Where is it? received my Flask today....happy withe built quality...good product...will use it for sometime and will come back with more updates... Backer #2337 from singapore still patiently awaiting flask Fred, I know you're busy but I have sent 2 direct messages without response 1 week apart. Please check your messages Backer #1572, Singapore Got mine this week, no tracking number received prior. Glad to have received, absolutely love it! Slight misalignment when cap is close but didn't encounter leakage. If there's a V2, would be good the mouth spout could use a little more radius. Looking and feeling it, can understand better why they encounter manufacturing problems. The shape is indeed complex. Kudos to Team Fred! Thanks for the great flask! :D Got mine today. It's really gorgeous. No leak. Stands up straight. Absolutely love it. No complains. Thanks for a great flask guys! :) Hi, Fred, once again, backer #939, no info from you so far. I'm getting really disappointed. Received mine today. Extremely attractive to look at. Having my first drink from the bottle and feeling strangely happy. Received mine yesterday. High quality product, nicely crafted. Leaking stop after adding the additional rubber pad into the cap. I can't resist taking a photo of this beautiful flask. <url>… I received my 2 brushed flasks today and wow! Their quality is superb, very smooth lines, solid construction, both are totally leakproof with the loop lanyards installed on the neck. It's a great design! Totally worth the waiting, very good work Fred! I am very happy with them :) I received my bottle 3 days ago and emailed right away at the provided email in regards to the wrong bottle being shipped. What is the expected turn around before I will be contacted? Got my 2 flasks and aside from the Army green being not quite olive drab, it is a magnificent design and execution. Neither of my bottles leak, but I also don't use the loop lanyards. While the Fred bottle might resemble the Sigg Retro Oval, it is more compact and crazy strong. I'm certainly pleased with this campaign! Got my flask this week. Really great design. I can understand why they had some many manufacturing problems because the shape of the design is quite complex and therefore very difficult to manufacture. However, I doubt you will find many similar flasks like this on the market for this reason. So for me I think that it is great to have this really stylish and unique flask at the expense of the long delivery time. got mine today. charcoal. charcoal cap doesn't fit properly. silver cap is leaking. Got mine yesterday, looks great. Same problem as posted below. Cap leaks with you put the loop lanyard on. Otherwise great! @Fred any idea on when the Kickstarter green and Marsala will arrive? Received mine today (Australia), one cap works good without put on the loop lanyard, otherwise,it leaks,and the other cap leaks... :( just received my brushed stainless steel. very happy with the bottle. no leaks, no rust, bottle able to stand on any side. happy with the product, not happy with the customer service. <url>#2183 from Singapore. Received my stainless steel flasks today. Totally awesome!! Flawless design... Thank you Fred team! The product rocks! Worth the wait. Can't wait to see your future products. I've just received my flask, but unfortunately the cap leaks. How can I contact you guys about it? Cheers Got my stainless steel flask today, in Germany. Great. I'm #4101 from Singapore. I have just received the Brushed Stainless Steel Fred Water Flask. No tracking number received prior. Glad to have received it. I must admit it was a long wait but it is Kickstarter. Received for 1 Brush SS -1 Fred Water Flask -2 Flask Caps with Silicone Disc that functions as an "O Ring" -1 Extra Silicone Disc -1 Loop Handle -2 Large Stickers and 1 Small Sticker The quality is very good. I use the Guyot/Nalgene Stainless Steel bottles and they're the best Stainless Steel bottles except that they're bulky. The better product is one that's with you for use. I can see in future when Fred Water Flask has stabilized and production and quality is very steady that it is a good thing to have. Hydration. Thanks Fred Water Flask :) I still love the video haha! Hi FRED, Backer #4318, like to check if you sent any shipping emails over? I didnt receive, thanks. I haven't receive mine yet. Shall I enjoy it in this summer, or next one? Haven't got any idea. Got it !! This morning ! Stainless Brushed. No problem with shipping and delivery. Seeing it in my hand is just a great product. Starting to use it this evening after a gentle wash. Thank you ! Mine arrived I love it thanks Fred.......long wait though This user's account has been deleted. My order for army green arrived as ordered and perfect thanks. No leaks, all good. Regards, tony The top pulls right off of my flask, I've tried different lids, but they do the same thing. Please replace the flask! Thanks, Larry Not everybody wants lemon with their water ;) I'm just trying to people to the reason why their water still tastes like steel after they did what is suggested. Your* The other solution was to try to put a bit of lemon in with you water. I have had my two since yesterday and I have found them to be very well made. The only problem is the steel taste for which there has been a solution. The only oversight with that solution in my opinion is: The snout. I've found that only applying the taste removal procedure (hot water + soap, rinse, then hot water + lemon slice) to the inside of the bottle is insufficient. I've applied it the entire bottle (inside + outside) and the taste problem is gone. Everything else works perfectly fine: Caps seal perfectly and there seem to be no leaks. Okay, So my order arrived today. I'd ordered two Brushed. I'd actually intended a bottle to be a birthday present for my partner, back in April, and thought I may as well add one in for myself. Anyway, that gives us two bottles and four caps. as far as 'My' bottle goes, of the four caps, three won't screw all the way on. That leaves me with one to use. I can get it to screw all the way on, although it fits with a slight offset. However, that's irrelevant, because it's not watertight! Whether the bottle is full to the brim or only a third full, if I shake it at all, water flies everywhere. I tested this several times, with the inside of the cap and the bottle thread wiped completely dry. Both bottles are now filled with water and sitting in bowls for a few hours, to check whether they leak - not that it'll make any difference to mine anyway, as of course, I can't use it. I can only hope my girlfriend's bottle doesn't leak, because if we have to swap, we're going have to hope that the cap she's currently using will fit on mine. Oh, I didn't get a lanyard either. Is there anything you can do to help, Fred? Maybe send me out some more caps to try? <url>#686 Backer #1255 here, received my stainless steel FRED in Bangkok today. No scratches & no leaking. The final product looks awesome !!! 100% satisfied. Backer #4177 California. No updates or tracking number. Just got mine in Wiltshire UK. Backer #4750. Many thanks Fred. It is awesome. Just got mine in Perth, Australia 1 x brushed steel backer #1846 Gotta say after such a long wait seeing the quality in person really justifies money well spent. My only gripe though is that none of the lids sit in alignment with the bottle that well when fully tightened and 1 lid just will not screw on at all properly. That being said i will definitely be looking at purchasing more in the future for my family. Just received a tracking number from the Fred Team. Flask has arrived in Singapore and hopefully making its way to me. Thanks for the number. Just received my SS flask in QLD Australia. Nice and sturdy was my first impression. Looking forward to using it! Finally got my bottle today (backer 1306 in Canada), and while it looks better than I had expected, one of the caps isnt threaded properly and leaks like crazy.. nice that there's 2 caps, but useless when one is only suited for the recycling bin. second complaint is that the bottle doesn't sit flat and is really wobbly on a table, even with the added weight of water. anything we can do about this? Kickstarter Green ordered --- Any news, confirmation, tracking numbers, really anything at all about orders/colors would be nice Fred. I've seen a few people getting Kickstarter Green already. Patiently waiting. Germany brushed finally there. no notification. nice work anyway. thanks :) When I put the strap on and screw down the lid, the bottle leaks. Does anyone else have this issue? @FRED WATER thanks! i'll give it a shot Im backer #1240 from indonesia, and still dont hv received anything.. Received my army green flask in the UK today. First impressions were great. The finish on the bottle is flawless but there's a fault with the thread on the bottle or on the supplied caps. With the green cap it's tricky to get the threads to engage. When you do, whilst everything appears fine as you start to screw it down, as you tighten it begins to sit unevenly on the bottle - not by much but enough to look bad. Tried the brushed steel spare cap to see if it did the same. It doesn't as the steel cap seems to be a different size on the inside and goes virtually all the way on without engaging the thread - only needs a quarter turn to tighten when the thread engages. Does it leak? No, not with either cap on but getting the cap on is fiddly and the fit of the green cap bugs me as it's not straight. It's just a few millimetres but it takes the edge off an otherwise fabulous looking bottle. Received my army green flask in the UK today. First impressions were great.

Laughable that Fred chooses to respond to a comment regarding how to rid the bottle of the metallic taste but can't be bothered to answer multiple inquiries over the past month on status of the remaining colored bottles. Any one else find some rust on their seams? I have rust on the curve under the neck no my army flask. My charcoal one arrived yesterday, fantastic quality and well worth the wait. Now part of my EDC Nice one Fred Love my flask. Worth the wait. Using it all day, every day. Got two bottles in the mail today eventhough I ordered just one. Not complaining though looks amazing so far. Worth the wait! May I know the standard items included for each flask? I have ordered one stainless steel and one charcoal. I totally got one stainless steel flask and one charcoal flask, three stainless steel caps and one charcoal cap and 2 extra rubber for insertion into the cap. Just wondered what's going on with the Marsala ones?? I'm living in Japan. I received a bottle today. Back in the UK. Didn't get an e-mail and haven't received anything in regards to post. My brushed steel and black bottles arrived in France yesterday. So far so good : every thing in good condition and no leakage, but they haven't been tested on the go yet. Can we please have an update on the rest of the colours. Backer#89 White UK. Any news yet? Going to collect mine from the sorting office this morning. U.K. Midlands Ok leak tests done and good news, neither of mine have any leakage. Filled each one half way and dried the outside, then shook it as hard as I could in every direction. Up and down, back and forth and not a drop seemed to escape. Then repeated with both full pretty much right to the very top and again no leaks. Oh and there are some sharp edges inside the neck of the green one as well. Just received my bottles today. First impressions are good, at least with my stainless one. Small couple scratches, and a mark near the neck where someone made a mistake with grinding/buffing. But it seems ok....leak test will take place shortly. My Army green....not really thrilled with the colour, little brighter than expected. Couple scratches in the coating near the neck...but the real issue is that there are little tiny pin prick sized bubbles in the finish. Ran my finger nail over one and it took a chip out of the finish. Not a huge mark, but given that there are 20-30 of these bubbles over the bottle, I'm less than impressed. I got mines a bit last week. Has anyone had issues with a metallic taste from the bottle? I've tried cleaning the bottle by soaking it in boiling water, leaving boiling water with some dawn inside, and trying to rinse the mouthpiece in warm water while washing with soap. None of that has really helped. Just got mine no leaks cap didn't come with logo other than that great stuff Ok, so wrist strap works on the neck (<url>"Please message, we can't respond in comments effectively". Apparently, messages are not being attended to too, according to comments of many backers in the comments page. I then sent a message myself to creator to test it out myself a few days ago, and yes, I have not received any reply yet. I don't think this is the right way to manage a Kickstarter project. I have seen many very good Kickstarter creators who constantly engaged the backers, and updated the backers of the project status. These are the creators who have repeat backers and strong support for their next Kickstarter project. Conversely, creators, like the Fred creator, who went silent and did not constantly keep the backers updated of project status, would lose the confidence and support of backers and would not do very well in their next project or product. If you decided to produce your product in a country like China, which is infamous for their quality issues, you should be prepared to get lots of imperfect goods and therefore be prepared to get in more staff to help out with quality inspection and customer communication, in this case the "customer" would be us, the Kickstarter backers, who once believed and showed support in your product. We, some of us have backed countless Kickstarter projects, do understand that projects will inevitably be delayed, Kickstarter projects are after all new starter projects that have nothing to start with. We just hope that you keep us constantly updated of the project status, what difficulties you are facing, what issues you encountered. If you do not have the time to update or respond to backers, get help. You should have expected the hiccups when you decided to go to China for manufacture. Now, reply to my message. My patience is starting to run out. I ordered light blue flasks and have not seen any information on when I can expect them here in New York City. Please update, thanks. So...MARCH 20, I asked to change the colour to orange. APRIL 06, your response was, "OK"... Received the bottle today and guess what, the colour is GREEN. Please advise... Got mine today, Seems to be pretty awesome. No leak so far. Only issue, I was suppose to get a Marsala colour and I got SS. Not the biggest issue. Ill live with it for a while and if it works as well as I hope ill just order another :) Just one more comment. The flask leaks unless I double up with the gasket included, but everytime I open the flask this loose gasket is suctioned in wards into the flask and almost falls in to the flask everytime. Is there any chance you guys will be addressing this problem? Thanks Both my bottles arrived today, so happy with everything about it, will be a gift for a friend! Thanks FRED Team! (Toronto, Canada) @Gordon, I wasn't sure that the bottles were being manufactured in China. Also, I was kind of referencing an old movie. Here's to receiving our bottles soon! Edit last comment: Canada, Toronto, Downtown. Got my bottle (Canada, Downtown). Superb quality, the steel feels very rigid and durable. The issue of standing up is a non-issue now, great initiative taken by Fred's Team to resolve that. I am planning to buy 5 more for a few of my friends. Cheers, All. Backer #1572 in Singapore, haven't received any tracking number nor flask. I don't mind the wait but would greatly appreciate even for a smallest update. It will greatly ease our mind :| My Brushed steel bottle arrived today as well ! Handsome bottle ! I did double-up the silicon on the lid and works really well, as for the wrist band it is on the neck of the bottle i assume. Great job well done! (Ireland) my bottle arrived today! so beautiful! thank you ��� Can we please have an update on the rest of the colours. Steel one arrived today in NZ! Did the old fill-n-shake test and seems to be good. Maybe anyone with a leaking cap try putting one of the spare silicone washers into it (double-up)? No idea how to use the wrist strap though... derp Thank you so much, UK brushed steel arrived today @Chris why did China get quotations?? Also I ordered the same colours, looking forward to them as well!!! Got mine today in Switzerland! Backer No.4489 in the UK and still no tracking info or any communication, I thought I might receive my stainless steel flask before I went on holiday but it has come and gone and still nothing, still looking forward to getting it but doubting if it will ever come at this point. I understand that this isn't a shopping website but I am a bit annoyed by the fact that you give info about planned deliveries and don't seem to be following through with them, like your April 28th update indicated that in a worst case scenario I should of received my flask over a month ago. Please keep us updated. Not to beat a dead horse, or flask in this case, but when do you (FRED) plan to provide a status on all the remaining colored flasks? I ordered Light Blue and Orange Flask sets. I have not received any tracking notification and have not seen any response from FRED in this comments section. Seriously, if you don't have a clue, then say so. Are they still in Asia being inspected, on a slow boat from "China" or still being packed for shipment? Lack of information at this point is not professional nor appreciated. I have purchased product from your website and feel sorry for anyone who tries to order a steel flask via the website. Please provide an update so that the remaining backers have some idea of when they might receive their colored bottles. Thanks. Got both of mine today! A ss and a green and I'm in love! Feels like quality got mine today!!! Arrived today in Oslo, Norway. Very happy with the product, just wish I had ordered more of them.:-) Well done, FRED! I got my bottle this week in Japan. When I threw in some water , the water leaks as someone mentioned. In my country people never call something which has possibility of leakage of the water, "Flask". I'm so disappointed. Just received it in The Netherlands. Looks great, looking forward to start using it. Me so happy Backer #3314 in Australia. Haven't receive mine yet. Still waiting for an answer. Check your inbox please. Washington state. Just got mine in green. Love it. Strong, thick, and will last me a life time. Well worth the wait. Thank you guys for making it well worth it. Just got my rather fine looking brushed steel Fred bottle and it looks as cool as Christmas. Backer #743 in the UK Would people please stop complaining. As the company said, everything will be shipped out, sooner or later. I recently got my tracking number, and then suddently, much sooner than I expected, a week later the product is on my doorstep, in amazing quality. If you haven't recieved it already, your product will arrive eventually, so would you please stop asking for trackingnumbers, as they will come when it's your turn? Btw Fred, thanks for the amazing product, worth the entire wait :D Well said Scott I have backed over 50 projects and did one myself. It's common for delays and unexpected turns. One project I backed shipped their product out two years after the expected ship date. I received my Fred flask today and the quality is superb. It sounds like they went beyond the call of duty to make things right and keep the standard up. Even after a slew of let downs. I jumped on board with their vision and excitement and I am grateful to be part of this fantastic Kickstarter campaign. Still waiting. This is BS. Nothing here is Oakland... ...c'mon guys, don't make a fool of me... I've been spreading praise on a product I've only heard bad things about and have yet to hold in my hand... have I made a mistake? Backer #29. Still waiting. Early, early bird backer. December 30, 2014. Nothing yet. Any idea when? Marin waiting.. Massachusetts here ... NOTHING ... Wow Backer #1966, early bird...ANNND...nothing yet Any idea when shipping would be made to the US backers? Thanks Mine arrived in Perth, Australia. Very happy - the quality is amazing. Backer #2477 - 1 stainless steel flask. Finally got my tracking number. Currently the flask transit @ SF to the destination. I asked about my stainless brushed steel flask on July 1st. As requested by you, not in the comments here, but with a private message. But still no answer yet and you already started sending out colored flasks. I've moved. Ya'll said my flask would mail out end of June. No tracking ever rec'd. How do I update address and ensure I get my flask? @Frederic Heuper I did, got my tracking id last wednesday. Worst campaign I've invested in on Kickstarter. I can't wish luck to anyone who runs a new venture this poorly. In truth, the way it's been run, there possibly isn't much of a future in it. Real shame. Statement or question? Sentence structure is confusing. @ Gordon Beautiful, my comment had the desired effect. Care to fully spell out the "D" in "D-Bag"? still no brushed in germany... :( anyone from germany who get at least a notification? @Rod Wow Sesquipedalian D-Bag @Gordon Gekko Wow! - a potty mouthed sycophant Would love and update on the colours and any new challenges you guy have been facing! Also not a post, an actual update ;) Also self important people demanding things from project creator.. They are doing everything in the power. If there is an issue, chill the fuck out and stop being so fucking rude !! :p Fred team reply me in e-mail "We wanted to let you know that your Fred Water Kickstarter pledge shipped via USPS, USPS First Class Mail Intl on 7/10/2015. You can track your package at any time using the link below." where is the link? notting below. except my address. can you sent the tracking number, pls thanks Sent several messages. No communication. Still waiting... since 2014 I got my bottle this week, and when I got home I was stoked, I loved the extra cap, as well as the spare rubber gaskets. I rinsed it out, threw in some water and chucked it in my work bag ready to hydrate and conquer. Got to work and after settling in went to grab it out for a sip of water. It had leaked all over my bag, I would guess about 3/4 of the container drained out. I was curious what the process is for getting it back to you guys, and getting a replacement shipped. Thanks! PS It looks awesome, and I am certain this is just an outlier issue. I received this message from Fred Water on June 30th when I asked them about the white flasks. "The white have not yet arrived to us to ship out to you. We will be sending out an update with timing on that color very shortly as well as potentially offer the ability for people to change to another color in-stock, if that will speed things up." I assume an update is coming, they have just been delayed. Since the regularity of updates is all over the place, I have no idea what "very shortly" is: two weeks, one month, 4-6 weeks? I realize this isn't Amazon and there are always delays bringing a new product to market, I just wish there were regular updates so we didn't feel so in the dark. Add to that 7 months of delays and infrequent updates, as well as confusing information (such as an update saying we can all expect an email with tracking info very soon, when that wasn't the case) makes this a VERY frustratingly run campaign. I got an email about the shipment being sent out, but no tracking number. got my tracking number yesterday, FYI. so it's coming. third time asking this now here and a pm sent a week and a half ago. Any update on when the rest of the colours are going to be sent out? Still waiting too... I still have not received my flask and I am moving tomorrow. Fred, any suggestions as to my corse of action? Thanks! hi there, i have received the email notification but there is not tracking number in there. please help. Five days ago you asked if my flask had arrived, as it says it was delivered. I assure you it has not arrived. I have sent several messages in hopes of locating it, with no reply. Please just contact me. The flasks are awesome but I was wondering if anyone else has what looks like rust located near where the cap screws on? After one use and two washes we noticed it and it doesn't wipe off. Any ideas? Messaged Fred and waiting on a response. That doesn't seem respectful. MY ORDER IS INCORRECT !!!! I am Backer # 632. My order was for 1 Brushed Steel and 1 Charcoal Grey Fred Water Flask. I received 1 Army Green Flask in lieu of the 1 Charcoal Grey Fred Water Flask. I WANT THE 1 CHARCOAL GREY FRED WATER FLASK WHICH WAS INITIALLY ORDERED. PLEASE INFORM ME OF THE STEPS WHICH WILL BE TAKEN TO RECTIFY THE ISSUE. Respectfully, Darren V Rohan I know we are expected to be respectful and considerate. I think for the most part all of the comments on here are. Even though I have received my flask and I am quite happy with it, I must say the communication on this campaign was something that New Kickstarters should use as an example of how NOT to run your campaign. Clearly FRED does not consider Updates important and feels that the backers should have to do the work in finding out what is going on with the product they are giving money to support. I have not backs a whole lot of products here on Kickstarter but I have to say that as far as communication goes, the worst so far. my apologies if any backers finds this disrespectful and inconsiderate, albeit factual. Oh, i dont seem to be alone. I messaged re: status of delivery and no response. Please give us more news if you still have issues. Can you check my bottle status please! I have sended many messages to you without response, Im pissed of this lack of communication. I rather get a refund and my flask. @FRED WATER thanks for the quick response. hey, how to get tracking no. for international shipment? I try to msg for a week and they did not responded... the last msg is telling about the flask that will shipping soon (ordered 4 : 2brush 1charcoal 1armygreen) so.... can you sent tracking no. to me plz thanks @EricChoy That looks like a weld. How they put the bottle together. No flask yet. Diana has put away her bosom, Apollo has lifted his skirt ! The day has been launched and I have received my charcoal FRED water flask!! Hey Fred. Any news on the other colours? Looking forward to having my kickstarter green flask in my hands. still receive nothing...no response... anyone could help? How can I get an update on the shipping status of my flask #4116 - please send update Just received tracking details to Australia also. Eric from those pics that looks like the inside of a weld, they can't get in there with a die grinder to smooth it off. Should be nothing to worry about as they mention all materials are food grade. Just received my Fred Flask today!! It's been a very long wait. But I am very happy with how it turned out. The black powder coating looks great and it was applied nicely. The time you spent with the welding issues paid off. It is very cleanly assembled. Another thing I was concerned about before it arrived was the overall size. But it seems to be just the perfect size. Any smaller and I would go through the water too quickly. A larger size would be too bulky. The caps snug up perfectly as well. Overall, this has been a very well executed product. Thanks! If it's not glue can you please explain what the residue or the material on the inside of the bottle is? This seam down the middle? <url>~ I received my charcoal flask yesterday. Firstly, I'd like to say thank you. I know it took longer than anticipated, but am happy to have it finally in my hands. My question is, should the cap have the Fred seal on it? I see in the picture on the campaign page it does, but mine does not. Can anyone confirm if this is something I should expect or was this just an error? Thanks I am Backer # 632 I have received the order today, however it is wrong. The order I received was 1 Stainless Steel Flask and 1 Army Green Flask. The original order was for 1 Stainless Steel Flask and 1 Charcoal Grey Flask. I specifically want the Charcoal Grey Flask!!! What will be done to correct this issue. Respectfully, Darren V Rohan Now that brushed steel, charcoal and army green are sent. What about the other colors ? Can I at least get a tracking number?? "Was also told that my Flask was shipped this week...we'll see. Stay Tuned..." I wrote that 7 days ago. Still nothing. VERY disappointed. Pledged December 11th, backer #2881 of brushed steel and charcoal. Got a message on May 20th that I should expect it in 10 or so days. Got home yesterday and there they were on my doorstep. Happy with finally getting them. Can't say that it was well worth the wait, BUT, they do look really good. If these became available later to purchase and deliver in a quick manor, I would buy more for friends. Hi, Fred. 11/26/14 — "Thanks for becoming a backer of Fred Water Flask..." Any updates? @Creator You said "Tracking numbers will hit your inbox if INT'L." Should we worry if we haven't received a tracking number by now? RoW shipping may take 4+ weeks with customs and all, so it would be really good to know that the bottles are on their way at least. Really pleased you are all getting yours and you are happy ... what about me? No communication for more than 12-month ... it seems a bit ... poor! Wish I had ordered more. Love it. Amazing flask and well worth the wait. Very cleaned up and solid construction. Only issue is that I somehow thought it was going to be made in the USA. Besides that well done. I cannot wait to see an American made improved version. Hint hint. ;) Damn, still waiting on mine, looking forward to it! Just got mine in MD; no tracking number, but that is OK. The bottle is gorgeous! I love how well the little silicon insert seals the bottle when it is closed. I filled it up before I went to the gym, stuck it in the fridge, and now I have a nice, cold bottle of water to chill down with! It has been a rough ride schedule wise, but totally worth every second! Well done guys! Just received mine as well and it was definitely worth the wait. I'm with Robert Kunda as after I got it cleaned up with Bottle Bright and took my first sip I thought the only way this could be better is if it was insulated. I take my last comment back just received mine, they are very nice can't wait to start using them! Will most likely buy more in the future in different colors! Super happy with mine. When's the campaign for a double wall version?!? ;) Just got my flask and have to say I am disappointed. The threading on the cap and bottle is absolutely terrible and takes far too much effort so screw on tight and threaded correctly, additionally I am really questioning your extra time for "quality control" due to the additional cap being scratched and marked to hell. My green flask arrived today. Well done! Received: one (1) Fred Water Flask (Army Green)...perfection! Couldn't be happier with the finished product. Just got home to a package on the doorstep. Was ecstatic to see it was shipped from you all, since i had not seen a shipping email I wasn't sure when to expect them. Could not be happier with the finished product. The seams look great and the flasks themselves are pristine. Received my tracking number last week, and flask today on the east coast! The flask is gorgeous and its bigger than I expected but the wait was for sure worth it. Stay strong guys! I've not received my bottle or any emails with tracking number and I live in Northern California. :( Received my stainless steel flask today. It's been a long wait. I'll get to use it next week when rain stops and heat piles in . Received my stainless & charcoal flask today! Very happy with the product. This user's account has been deleted. Hi, I know this is Last minute but I have recently moved house, is it still possible to change my shipping address? I'm from the UK :) thanks! My Charcoal arrived yesterday in SoCal, however I did request a brushed one back when they said it would arrive sooner if i changed it. It looks very nice. I washed it with some soap and water to get rid of an oily substance around the neck, I assume its a lubricant used during manufacturing. Used it while cleaning the garage. It fit nicely in my pocket and I'm happy with the product. I hope it holds up well, but I have no reason to believe that it won't. Recommendation for Fred Flask 2.0 would be to have some ridges on the cap, it can get slippery when wet or greasy. 2 arrived for me today. Aesthetically pleasing, I hope they perform as well as they look. Wondering about the strap. is it to be slipped over the opening and then cap sort of forced on? Great project and I am really glad I got in on this. My brushed and charcoal flasks just arrived today in Minnesota. They are things of beauty! Any word haven't received mine yet OK, I received my Fred Water Flask just now...! Love it!!! Thanks guys... I would love to see another update about these flasks. I ordered 2 of them and am trying to be patient but seeing that some people are receiving theirs, sans tracking, is getting frustrating. Are you mailing them in any sort of order? Where are the tracking numbers that no one seems to be getting? Hi Guys, Not sure if it's because im in Singapore, but i havent received any emails as of yet. Could i check if i was missed out? :P Thanks! My flask came this morning, great project guys, brilliant product--Cheers! <url>"HOLY SHIT ITS FRED FLASK" was my confused/happy reaction upon opening a package which I assumed was another Amazon Prime delivery. But yah I finally gots it, super dope about to clean and start carrying it around So what's the point of us filling out the surveys if you aren't even going to mail my flask to the address I used? My flask is set to be delivered tomorrow to an address in Chicago that I don't live at. I live in Virginia and that is what my survey says. Somebody else will be getting the flask that I have been waiting months for. The Fred team better fix this issue. Thank You so Much for the Flask, well worth the wait. Got it today in Utah. <url>#3858 I messaged them and they responded the same day. They are doing their job. Delays are frustrating but we'll get it soon I have not gotten an update on shipping information in a month. any word on if they notify you when your flask gets shipped? I love supporting FRED water, but dang this is the biggest delay I have ever had to deal with. I expected more from FRED. I ordered a brushed steel bottle in the U.S. but I still haven't gotten any email. Help? I am #2609 just checking on my order... hi I come from Hong Kong and no news for me!! Quick message to say I'm in the U.S. and just got a message from fedex (as I have an a/c with them) to say my flask has been picked up and will be delivered next Wednesday. I know the wait is frustrating for everyone, but it certainly my seems we're all going to get or flasks. I've had a couple of projects where it was essentially just a scam and I didn't get anything. Also I know folks have said a lot about communication, but I've seen the creators post lots of comments here versus other projects where I hear nothing for weeks or months. I'm sure the creators would acknowledge that there are lessons to be learned and that they'd do some things differently, but I also believe they are trying their hardest to get us a high quality product as quickly as possible..some things are just outside their control. I'll send an update when the flask arrives, but fingers crossed everyone doesn't have to wait too much longer. So in June the update was "Our goal is to have all Flasks shipped out during this month.". I realize it is only July 1st but how was that goal? I'm backer 835 and in California. No notification yet. Any word? Hi UK and no news no email. no flask... nyc here.... still no flask.... this is bs! Doesn't seem like people are receiving their flasks even though they should be...sounds like we need an official update. This speaks volumes!! I Tweeted Adam Gayner yesterday asking him as founder of Fred Water Flasks if he is even aware of the issues on Kickstarter. No response. Hasn't even been on twitter since February. Was also told that my Flask was shipped this week...we'll see. Stay Tuned. I'm still stunned that they refuse to use the Updates area to inform us of anything. Never seen anything like this! Lol Nick, I'm waiting for my SUPER EARLY BIRD also :D no clue if I'll receive it before summer ends... @Fredwater - 100% answered? That's funny, i asked a question on the 12th and still have no answer. Check your messages, cause it's still there. Nor do i have a shipping email as was promised 3 days ago. Still waiting for my order of the "earlier bird" stainless steel flask? When should it arrive?? FRED WATER FRED WATER May 14 2015 Hi David, Saw your comment. Charcoal or brushed could go out tomorrow. Army green next week. Orange is going to be a bit, expect it to ship but ot takes 10-12 days tonget here and through customs. What would you like to do, change color? - A That was about 45 days ago. Just WOW. Still no news too here... Uxbridge, MA no email no Charcoal Fred Water Flask. There you go Fred, you want a message, here it is. What's the status of my Flask? @Soltyk - that's correct, replacement received and working as expected. @Geo A. You said your bottle had a 'pinhole leak' when you received it in April. Did you get a replacement? Backer 1,001 in the U.S. - got my brushed steel flask - very satisfied! Thanks again. No flasks, no replies of my message, no email - not the finest way to do business at kickstarter. And I'm a "Super Early Bird" Backer. I live in San Rafael. Fred is in Sausalito. I paddle my canoe from my house to Sausalito...Seriously. No email. No Flask. Thirsty. Waiting for mine here in the States. No e-mail either. Me neither. Waiting for brushed steel in Sydney, Australia. No email too. :'( I live in Denmark and is still wating for my flask in brushed steel. No email either. I haven't receive any email on the shipment yet and I stay in Singapore. May I know when will mine be ship out? Thanks @Michael they should be here by the end of the week! "Note: US Customers of the charcoal, brushed and army pledges will not get an email because we ended up using FedEx Ground in the US instead through a faster fulfillment house. They should all arrive in the next 4 to 5 business days in the US." No email, no updates, I ordered two brushed flasks on NOV 24 and know people who ordered colored ones the day the campaign ended who have their flasks! Why do you continue to treat your customers so poorly? Wonderful! I can't wait! what about people outside the usa? you said shipping out wednesday (as in the 24th), shipping out soon, shipping out to usa only. the stringing along is getting old. What is the word on the rest of the colors? Where they up to sepcs? Have anyone (non US resident) gotten an email notice for brushed? Personally, I have not. Fred Team, would you mind a quick update on international backers? You say all brushed are being sent out. I haven't received a shipping email. Are you sending shipping emails? or is my bottle just going to show up randomly in the mail? How do I get a refund this sucks It sucks to buy something and not get it So brushed should mean I get my flask in the UK this week or the next week? I'm on holiday in 10 days and summer will be over after that so the need to carry water sort of diminishes Jase, UK Address good. Thank you! The rest will be shipping soon. - The Fred Team Soon. Can you be more specific? This was suppose to be here by Christmas 2015. I'm 61 years old and I'd like to receive it before I die. I hope you have the common sense enough to be truly embarrassed by how you've delivered on this campaign. Might I suggest for find a different line of work. Thank you. I should be soon, I think. Still excited. If I wanted a bottle quickly, I would have used Amazon. Thanks for sticking to your strict standards. I'm sure it will be worth the wait. Fed up of waiting. Hoping to get my money refund? Still receive nothing! Just wanted to be the 1,000th comment. Looking forward to getting my flask, hopefully soon. How can I get a status on my order?I haven't received an update in quite a while. Also- Anyone know how to figure out what # backer you are? Could you please contact me and let me know what address you have for me? I can't be sure it's correct. Thank you! Thanks for the update on the charcoal! im pledged for charcoal but i got no email And another one with no email (UK), pledged for a brushed and charcoal. Hi! I really like my flask, my coworkers want one for them, thank you not really a surprise to be honest... that's actually the good thing by getting used to be disappointed...you don't expect good things to happen... no email here either, backer 1306 with a charcoal flask. not surprised though.. Same here, no E-Mail regarding shipment to germany. Hello, I have not received any email, i live in Germany...( still shipping? didnt get the email yet The flask looks so cool but this waiting is driving me crazy. So near but still seems so far away! If anybody gets an email, tell us in the comments. Will these shipments be related to backer order at all? Hello team, following your comment, no email or whatsoever regarding my order (brushed & charcoal bottles) :/ not cool but happy to see some positive news from you :) better later than never I hope! Cheerio from France. Finally! Looking forward to an email notification and a new flask still waiting for anything in germany..... will need to change my address for where my flask is being shipped to, is it still possible? Updates on other colored bottles would be nice. Waiting for my Light Blue and Orange bottle sets. Are they still on a slow boat coming from China sailing along in the middle of the Pacific or are they coming into port? Thanks. Hey guys, I need to change my mailing address and can't seem to do it through the process you recommended. Let me know. Thanks. Hey, Guys. When will you be sending out the email to the backers? Your comment update indicated and email to be sent but did not indicate a date for it to be sent. Considering that the current shipment isn't in the U.S. now, do you anticipate any delays at customs as was an issue in the past with this project? Great! I am anticipating to get your email soon! Im from indonesia, and still not received anything. Hurray!!! Hope I'll be in the email or my charcoal flask. @Fred Water, Sounds good, but what about the white colored bottles? Thanks Best Jan If you guys are shipping from a warehouse called "KC Warehouse" In San Diego, I just got my flask delivered to me in Tucson, AZ. That is great..... Except for the fact that i live about 3000 miles away in NJ. Never lived anywhere close to AZ. Please advise ASAP. Thank you. I am getting extremely thirsty!!! So nothing on the social media front.. @Chris, one of mine was supposed to be a Christmas gift.. Good Day, My name is Darren V Rohan...Backer # 632. My pledge is for 2 Fred Water Flask...1 Brushed Steel Flask and 1 Black Colored Flask. I would like to know if my order has been completed and shipped. Please provide me with a tracking number, when possible. Respectfully, Darren V Rohan <email> Hey Fred! Any updates? It's been about two weeks since your last one. I am still waiting to hear that my two colored bottles are shipping in their gift boxes. One bottle was supposed to be a birthday gift (May birthday). Now it's looking like it may be an anniversary gift. Really?!?! I obviously will put something else in the box because I love my wife. Maybe I'll give it to her during a tropical island vacation. That would be really nice, but I need to have the bottles first! The last update (June 5) states that you expect all bottles to have shipped by the end of June. Are you on track for this? I reached out to them on their twitter page. If they respond I will let you know the response. Time for an update. Has anyone recently received a shipping notification? Hi Team, I have not received my 2 stainless steel series. Funder from Singapore - <email> Please provide an update. I'm still waiting for my order. Especially when the projected (& updated) delivery times come and go without comment, warning or explanation... Thanks Theo, you totally got me. For me, it's not the matter of "how long this lasts". It's more the fact that we don't get regular updates. All I ask for are Weekly updates, even if nothing changed. Ok, Look!! What all you people who are saying that "this isn't amazon" and "too many stress people" and "be patient" etc.. All we are asking for is consistent updates and The Comments section is not the place to get these updates!! If you happen to look about half way up the screen there is the word "Updates" that's is where we should be seeing the Updates on this product and guess what when they post updates, they get delivered to our email inboxes! That way we don't have to constantly check the comments section for updates that we should be getting on a regular basis! OK!!?? @Fangmutt??? , OK??!! Pheonix Youth???!! I don't believe that this is too much to ask. Same comment posted just now again - when can I get the brushed steel flask ? @Fangmutt I beg your pardon? I'd like to "fill" some of the flasks for folks before they get them. (Kickstarter ain't Amazon people!) I agree with Phoenix Youth! Too many stressy people these days. Yep I'm still waiting, but I have read the updates and I think these guys know what they are doing. Would prefer them to focus on getting the product out rather than having to deal with lots of folk putting them down for no good reason. Have backed maybe 20 Kickstarter projects, and believe me these guys are pretty good with updates compared to many others. Please remember, you are buying into a design and development programme, this stuff all takes time, and at the end of the day we all get really cool products. You gotta to live with the delay. @Jeremy I get the why he is frustrated. on the 30th it was Days till the bottles were going to be delivered. In reality this should have been more defined. 16 days later we are still waiting to hear back from this.. Nah... Not a shame, your attitude and your ability to keep on track with the updates that's been happening with this campaign, that's a shame. Read update, scroll down. There is no way you should not know wtf is going on. Germany is still waiting, too! Ordered 4 Flasks and I'm getting a bit pissed, too! Your unregular updates are a shame for the whole Kickstarter Platform! Give us an Update! @Fred any updates? Just one simple question. WHEN it will be shipped from your warehouse to my home? Backer 198, nothing... Hey guys I haven't exactly done my due diligence with keeping up on this project. I understand there have been delays, but is there a form or survey I need to fill out to claim my reward? Have any bottles been shipped yet? Wassssssuuuuup? Hey guys, Felex is about to lose it! Water bottle rage!! No email received yet.. When to receive my 2 Fred Flask? Losing patience.. Pls help to check.. Thanks! Where is my flask man! I am getting thirsty! I got an email a couple of weeks ago saying its being shipped that following Monday. never received tracking details or anything after that. Has my flask actually been shipped? Keep up the good work in ensuring your product the "Fred Water Flask" is top notch and the backers receive the quality product promised and backed. � @Jeremy C, you've probably just created a monster! Haha. Can I change my color? (jk) I just changed my address on kickstarter, do I need to do anything else? Haven't received my stainless steel flask yet, BTW I'm in canada Interesting that people seem to confuse Kickstarter and Amazon. I've enjoyed the opportunity to learn more about the process and challenges associated with entrepreneurship and what it takes to swim against the current, to manufacture a quality well thought out product that is different than the crap that is churned out and ultimately designed to be disposable. Looking forward to getting my bottle and feeling like I played a small, no tiny, no minuscule, closer to almost infinitesimal part in it. More pissed than stoked. Will it ever arrive? Can't wait to be done with you and kickstarter. @nelson, you'll definitely be able to give your friend on ONE of the octobers. :D @fred, thanks for the much appreciated update. the black looks great. hoping the white is equally awesome. Thanky you. This is the update we've been waiting for. Hi - please would you keep us updated through email? Understand starting a new product line that is different from existing products presents more challenges than we can imagine. It's also exciting and that's what draws this community together. All the best sorting them out and I look forward to getting the bottles soon. Be respectful and considerate eh...Ok, I'll try. Dear God, when will we be getting the bottles that were suppose to arrive as Christmas gifts 2014. Thank you. Dan @Fred did you get all the flasks? @FWF We understand that the bottle is hard to make, there were some issues and problems, but you guys have to understand as well that we are LITERALLY in the middle of the summer. I mean... damn... Should I explain it? @Graham @Theo I totally agree with you guys. I would like to point out the "So every night, we talk with the owner." part. If this really happens, I don't get why we can't get regular updates. The latest update was in the end of April and if I don't check the comment sesction sometimes, I wouldn't know anything about it. We don't want factory secrets or some shit like that, but just regular - even tiny little updates, how it is goin', what's happening and such. @Jeremy, maybe updates doesn't change the delay, but it do helps people getting chilled and calmed down. Just saw the updates as well! Super excited now. :) Counting down the days I just saw the updates, I hope international shipping dates wil lbe included in the next update. I am hoping to gift one of my flasks as a birthday present to a friend in October, any chance I wil lget mine by then? thanks Cool. At least my fiancee got her stainless steel flask already. It's NICE! I'm looking forward to my Light Blue flask. Although, had I known this would take so much longer, then I would have just gotten the stainless steel (we were both Super Earl Birds). In fact, I wish they (Kickstarter creators) would stop doing stretch goals in terms of extra colors or variants. They only seem to delay production. P.S. The plastic Fred Water flasks are surprisingly durable. We have 2 from over a year ago, and they are being refilled constantly. Thanks for update Adam & co! Stoked to be backing the beginning of something great. Keeping the stoke high and looking forward to getting my hands on them! Thanks for the update. Still stoked on receiving my flask! Is it possible to ship it to another address? I'm still really stoked about this project. I know it'll be worth the wait when I get mine! Well, your wrong.. It is. You will get your water drinking contraption. Someone posting the same news as the week before is not going to change that. @Jeremy C its an Fing $20+ water bottle project that we all decided to help back with our money. All @graham ervin, like most of us, is asking is that we get the updates weekly or even bi weekly just stating something. We as backers should not have to login to Kickstarter to get our updates in the comments section. I too am backing a few projects and I get weekly (every Sunday) from them. Bi weekly from another. I don't think asking for regular updates is having our hands held. Its just good customer service. @graham.. It a fing water bottle.. Pretty sure they updates that have come out have let us know what's up... They don't need to hold your hand <3 That was a great update below but it should have been sent out as an official update that went into you email. Many of us have backed things on Kickstarter before and are use problems in manufacturing and delays. I currently have several products that I am waiting on from other companies, but the difference is that I get weekly emails from ALL OTHER projects except this one. I'm not sure how you still have not realized that people are upset about your lack of communication and not necessarily that there are are delays. We get that working with Asia is difficult, but all of your posts have been defensive and unapologetic. We just want to be kept in the loop, even if that means just saying "Sorry more delays, will get you more info when we have it." By placing an update in the comments of the page you are making your customers seek you out to get any info. Listen to your customers, it's in basically every post on here... @Creator: excellent well worded comment update. Patience is rewarded. Thanks for the update guys. Looking forward to getting a great quality product. I think all any of the backers want is communication as per your point, #2 in your last post. Just let people know what's going on, on a regular basis. Things happen, just keep us informed. Thanks for the update. I am confident that FRED WATER will put the best possible product into our hands as soon as they can. Thanks again for all the hard work! Hi, I'm from Chile. When do you think I could get my flasks? Thanks! where is my flask? I did not receive my 2 flasks, and I haven't received an update in some time now. I pledged in November, still nothing, estimated delivery was January for early backers. I feel they should have know where they were going to have flasks made before starting project. Maybe they did, I don't like the idea that it's made in China but what can you do. I'm really pissed that it's taken sooooooo long. I know there are lots of backers but I'd like to know what's the estimate time your receiving it from China? I NEED MY FRED FLASK ASAP!! CALIFORNIA IS IN A DROUGHT I NEED A PLACE TO STASH MY EMERGENCY WATER! Hey Fred, hope everything is going well. Can we get an update from you please? I'd really like to see some pictures of the color coated flasks, pictures of the factory, something. Just so us backers have a little more clarity in all of this. I know kickstarter doesn't let you update all of the time so I hope by now you'll be able to. Can't wait to get my orange one in my hands. Thanks again Fred. it states ' Be respectful and considerate' one update a month is a joke. Customer Service is always remembering that without your customer you are just someone who makes something that no one buys. You seem to have forgotten this as you already have our money. Kickstarter is a great idea, they must be looking at you and thinking we need to put more checks in place because companies like yourself are ruining our reputation. You claim to be having production issues, you get what you pay for, if you are using a cheap Chinese production facility then that is your issue. You designed your business model not your customer so if you are having issues then this is your issue. You put the high quality spec out there and your customers bought the product based on this and the fact that kickstarter is a cool website. why don't you be 'Be respectful and considerate' to your customers and give us an update on how the production facility that you picked is letting you down and still not managing to achieve the high quality that you promised us. Or try googling Customer Service it might give you some ideas on what to do next. Just do something because doing nothing is getting on my tits. Just off to fill up my plastic bottle, its getting a bit tatty, I thought I'd have binned it by now..... @Nicholas Wax and @Fangmutt What I find amazing that that Fred updates here but a mass update hasn't been sent in a months time. The last I heard is that all the stainless steel flasks are going out but the colored flasks are still having issues passing QC. Of course everyone that ordered a flask is getting one and the final ones are being sent out. Are we to assume that means the colored ones as well or just the stainless steel flasks. Be as sarcastic as you want regarding the comments but, Fred should learn from this and update more on his next project. Amazing how people do not seem to read the thread and just fire off a demanding comment. Fred has provided constant updates. They are on their way. I suggest folks read the post from Fred about 18 hours ago that says, "Every single person is getting their flask. Final set of flasks preparing to ship [from China] to Fred to [immediately] go out [to you]." I'm guessing that "every single person" means everyone that has ordered a flask and not yet received it. I am still looking out for my Flasks as well. Haven't seen anything yet. @Fred does this mean this includes all colored flasks? Hi - I moved to a new state. Where do I send my change of address? Thx! hi... im backer 1240 i live at indonesia, and havent got the flask. How do we know it is shipped out? I PMed you a few times but received no response after you said you were going to mail out my brushed stainless Fred in April. Can I have the tracking number? Backer #740 Apr 12 2015 Hi Alan. We figured out what went wrong with your shipment. You pledged for a color flask, but chose brushed. Because we do not yet have color in, your shipment did not go out. We will send yours out on Monday. Sorry for confusion. Thank you Fred Water, my flask arrived this morning and I have to say this is one sturdy flask. It will outlast generations to come. Good job! I havent received any emails, updates or shipping notifications. I just want an update. WTF is my flask(s) did you take a holiday with our money? Eta date on my pledge says February 2015....it's fricken May!!!! What's the ETA? I ordered an Early Bird Special Brushed Steel and haven't received mine yet? A little concerned if there's more delays because I'll be moving to a different state in a month. 2 of my friends have received theirs but i still have not received mine. Anyone has received their flask? I'm so not going to get my flask. :D At least I was a super early bird special backer, so I only lost 35 bucks. And my faith. I received an email a month ago, informing me that my flask has been shipped with a tracking number. The tracking is still showing "Pre-Shipment Info Sent to USPS" after a whole month. I am pretty sure it's lost, since it should have been delivered after 2 weeks the latest. I do not mind the delay, I am only afraid that I might not actually get one. Backed this project half a year ago hoping i can use it in school. Now that i'm graduating, i'm still not receiving anything. With the estimated delivery date to be in January, we need more updates and explanation please. It would also be cool to see some photos of the factory where they are being made. Wish these could be shipped from China to Australia direct. This is taking forever.. but I appreciate the updates and I am looking forward to one day drinking water out of my orange metal flask! Hi there Fred, good work with flasks! What kind of surface treatment do the flasks get on the inside to avoid rust at the weldment? Since you manufacturing products in china, Is there any chance that chinese backers get the reward earlier? still waiting on delivery of my flask. I have also changed address and notified you a few times without any response How do I contact the creators directly? I really need to change the shipping address of my fred flask and i have not gotten a response yet. Ok Fred , thank you for this news � If we ordered a brushed steel one and a coloured one do they get sent out separately or at the same time? And I apologize, I got their last update confused with another project... it's been less than one month since they've had an update. @Jamie They have been communicating, they have 28 updates since the project started, one just a month and a half ago, plus multiple responses to backers in the comments in the past weeks. I think they've been very vocal about the issues they have faced and dealt with. I've backed other projects where the creators put out a update maybe every three months. I'm an impatient person, but I also understand that sometimes there just isn't anything to say. @Fred so what is the ETA on colored flasks? That being said, Fred, I'm sure you'd do your best to weed out those crap-quality flasks. We backers wouldn't be very pleased if after all the time and checks, we still receive crap-quality flasks. i would rather wait a while more than to get a crap-quality flask with rusty welds. come on guys, it's made in China, and if you've seen stuffs that come out of China, you know they do not have any quality checks. Fred is spending their time to ensure the rusty welds don't get to our hands (and then into our tummies!). Do cut them some slack. :) @ Ryan McKnight. Most people realise it is not a retail store. Waits are inevitable. It is lack of timely communication from the creators of the project that annoys people. When will people realize Kickstarter isn't a retail store. � Hi OK this project is way overdue and there appears to be very little communication from them that run it. I am concerned because many promises have been made and not kept. Sure problems are always encountered but this project is not bleeding edge. I would like to be informed when I will receive paid for goods. Failure on your part will force me to report this to Kickstarters ( which won't do much) and if this doesn't work I will move my complaints to Amazon. Thank you Backer #2881 I sent a message yesterday just asking if there will be any updates to my order and I received this message: FRED WATER says: Yes, your charcoal is on a plane to us and then we will send it right out. They passed QA and are ready to go as soon as they land here. We will send an email when they land, expect 10 days or less. - A I'm just glad the extra long wait = a solid well made product, instead of a half as* product like was first coming from the supplier in China... For me I'm not thrilled about the extra wait time but I'm understanding of it if it's due to better quality product so as long as I don't have big slag hanging inside my flask or tops that don't go on right & pin holes in the steel then I'm fine with a longer wait personally any updates on the flask, fred! very sad still haven't received my flasks and I really was looking forward to having them for gifts wah soooo thirsty lahhhh @Lindsay Maiello try <url>#1076 here, i don't mind the wait but please don't forget about me. So maybe time for another update since it's been almost a month since the last one and still haven't received my flask. I have had my FRED Flask for quite a few weeks now, have had nothing but water and ice tea in it. It's starting to smell (yes, I've washed it several times). Is there a trick to getting rid of a smell and to prevent it from happening again? I love my FF! looking forward to recieving the flasks (4) here in austria as well. i can't beleive that it has taken so long to produce and deliver on this kickstarter project. Thanks Fred, my wife will never let me contribute to a Kickstarter Projekt again :-(( Yeah ! I received a mail saying that my bottle is in the air to Fred, and they will ship it to me 10-12 days after they receive it, at least I have information now :) I was just looking at the latest update, and that was in april... I ordered two normal colours, not weird ones and was just wondering if they were acctualy ever coming? Hi, backer #1,226 here.....how's it looking? A backer (#1842) from Australia here. I ordered the Early Bird Special (Brushed Steel) but have not heard anything yet regarding the shipment. Can I at least get a rough idea on when it might be shipped? Even telling me which Month you will be shipping is fine... Still have no information about my shipment, no update, and no package received of course, I ordered Charcoal color, not an exotic unicorn rainbow color so hard to produce. Can you please let us know when you ship to France ? Backer #336 brushed steel. Did you guys skip me?!?!?!?!?!? HI - I was hoping to get my water bottles in January and I have seen the updates but is this coming anytime soon? I would like to give it to my boss for her Birthday in July???? Could some one please email me or let me know? thanks!! Just received my package from Sausalito, CA (05/19/15) - Ordered the Early Bird Special in brushed steel #2259 FRED is the most rock solid water bottle I've ever owned, it came well packaged with the 2 laser etched bottle caps in bubble wrap and packing paper to protect the bottle. The lanyard is well made and a nice addition I wan't sure I'd like, but I was wrong. On 05/12/15 I commented here that I hadn't received anything, I got a direct message on 05/13 advising me FRED was shipping next day - FRED was shipped Priority mail 2 day on 05/15 and arrived in Brooklyn 05/19. My 2 cents, overall this has been a well executed campaign with primary focus being quality; the FRED team has been responsive to many backers and is active and transparent. Yes there were delays and the team did an excellent job providing specific details - this is a great example of a responsible KS project. Cheers guys! its a simple flask....where or where are they? any chance that kickstarter backers would be able to get a coupon code on yalls site with a massive discount for waiting? Backer Number 1,899 still no info. It's getting pretty hot outside..... There was an update in the this comment section 4 days ago. Scroll down and read it. when can I get the brushed steel flask ? wtf is up guys????? UPDATE?!?!?! haven't heard anything from this campaign for quite a long time. i don't know 'bout you guys, but I dont think my bottle would be shipped shortly as I live very far across the country, I'm in Indonesia by the way. based on my previous campaign experience the package shipment period took about more than a month. andconsidering THIS campaign have shown nothing but almost-a-month-already update all I can say is that this's really wasting time, but I can wait, I have to. and I hope the bottle would be really really great. Backer 4365. stainless to ger. Waiting. Not the first time on ks. Also on indigogo. Strange. Just curious, has anyone received a colored flask? Yes, the last update was almost a month ago. We would all like an update on ETA. Backer #320 here--still no sign of my stainless bottle and I jumped on the bandwagon fairly early. Let us know what's happening please. @Fred so what is the ETA for all colored flasks? hi,, i'm still waiting for mine. it there any tracking number? It's been a month, anyone else has any idea on this? Received an email saying my bottle was shipped to Canada on April 28. Given a shipping tracking number that doesn't show the package has gone anywhere, and no sign of the package as yet... It shouldn't take that long to get to Vancouver. Please advise on what I should do. Thanks, Dan. Thank you for your update! You have no idea how much a simple post can mean to people. It's like water in the desert. Well I've commented and messaged you guys directly and can't get a response. Can we get an update here? I'm in the 500s for a brushed flask and nothing and seeing people overseas in the 2000s getting their flasks already, what's the deal? I backed this as a late Xmas present to my nephew but at this pace it'll be on time for Xmas this year. Asked three weeks ago to see the "New" Army Green color still no response from you Adam go ahead and process that refund. Since I am backer #4709, I take it I am never getting my flasks…. After waiting for a while, I went ahead and purchased a S'well bottle. Stainless steel and keeps water cold for 24 hours. I'm still very much looking forward to my charcoal Fred flask when it arrives. Finally! Thank you for the update! And ya know, a little something extra for us backers who have had to wait extra long night not hurt...just sayin. Can't wait to get my charcoal flask! I just sent a tweet to them to see if I would get a response.. @Kristaps I hope it does not show up :p ps: Stainless germany #12 got it a week ago, pretty good only complaint the opening could be a bit more rounded. Oops, too late type 2 diabetes got me before the flask... But seriously guys when backed I was sure that flask will be delivered before I leave for my trip around the Globe for next 3 years. Only 48 days left for me to go. I would love to take Fred flask with me on the road. I will be cycling through Europe, sailing across Atlantic, hitchhiking in South America, exploring jungle and conquering reasonably high peaks, spending time on beaches all the long and doing God knows what on other side of the Globe. I would love to share with you some great pictures and video, but please do the magic and make sure the flask reaches me before July 1st. Best regards, Kristaps. #3018 from Australia with an early bird brushed flask and nothing yet. When will you guys start acknowledging your backers? #198 and nothing. Not looking good Hi! Who do i need to speak to in regard to changing the address I want my water bottle shipped to? It's a couple of weeks since he last update. Still hoping that I will see my flask this year (2015)! Can you give us some idea of the timing for the next batch of flasks? Thanks Matt Backer# 2064 here I am really thirsty now Is there any update info for our water flask :P How about another update that doesn't promise a product that isn't ready or isn't actually mailing? Hi Fred, what's the scoop on our Flasks? No sign of Early Bird Stainless Steel in Brooklyn - What happened to the 1500 from the early April update? hi fred, no sign of the flask yet. Got the brushed steel flask two weeks ago and it's amazing! Thank you so much :) Backer #824 from Malaysia Lot's of comments underneath this one with no responses...what's up Fred?? Backer #320 here--I should like very much to have an update! Backer #3306 from Singapore; ordered brushed steel and an orange. Still no word. :( Never before have I regretted buying a water bottle with such passion. What the hell? Could you have not spent some of the $200k to do your research on Chinese manufacturing? Havent gotten mine yet either, but I hope theyre just busy getting them out Still haven't gotten mine either - but excitedly awaiting its arrival. I've pm'ed a couple of times and have had no response to this question --> Considering I get my flask's and like them, would I be able to order additional flasks at the KS price? Ideally, I would like to order 10 black ones for groomsmen. @fred thoughts? Hi there yes i would love to see a new update About The flasks i have stainless and colour flasks orderd im from The netherlands but have nor receaved anything yet @gunther I agree I'm not thrilled with the wait but if it means a better product I'll be getting then wait I will! Backer #1997 for one colored flask. I'm trying to be patient bc id rather have a great product instead of a crappy product now. But can you update on COLOR flasks please? Hi there, backer 1501 from Australia. No sign of the flask yet. Just checking in. Backer #3692, Kickstarter Green, Honolulu. No flask yet but still optimistic! still no brushed steel flask and no reply from the creator :( @Chris what are the instructions for getting rid of the metallic taste? Hey guys, after following the instructions on how to remove the metallic taste, the Flask is great. I use it daily, which makes for fun times with explaining that it's not loaded with liquor So I'm backer #294 and I plegded for one brushed steel flask and I haven't received anything yet? Backer #154 but with color flasks in my order. ;-) Actually, according to the update, we should/could have the flasks by the 19-21st (@ least Stateside). (10 business days from 4/27=today or Monday depending, so 5/8 or 5/11 + 10 day air ship (which will happen in stages with some moving quite a bit faster since there is no plane that can physically fly that slow or carry that much fuel) = 5/19 or 5/21 + 2 day ship to US locations = 5/21 or 5/23.) They should be pretty much done and shipping in the next couple business days at the latest according to their time line and may have been done already do things went well. If they aren't, that should be known by now as well. An update doesn't take that long and would be well appreciated. At this point, I don't think asking for more frequent updates, considering the history of delays, is out of line. It all grows out of a collective excitement for the product so it's all good anyway!

It all grows out of a collective excitement for the product so it's all good anyway! any international backer who got it already ? :) starting a trip to asia in 2 month, i hope i can take my flask with me :/ Guys, the last update has the shipping date from China to Fred by May 19th - 21st. Then the flasks should arrive at Fred by June 2nd to 4th and arrive at the backers by 4th - 8th for US, and 9th - 22nd for international backers. Delays are very disappointing and I am want my flask too, but if there is nothing new, an update makes no sense. Backer 198, still waiting in California *~* still waiting I am very disappointed. I really want my flask.You guys stated that orders will be dispatched in order from first backer to last. I'm about #550 and I'm seeing people already getting there's that are backer #2000+. And then there is that poor person that's #89 that hasn't seen his yet. Are we ever going to get our flasks??? Actually, an update would be appreciated as the last update listed approximate dates which are coming up. It would be nice to know if these dates are still good or if we are looking at another possible time frame shift. (Don't want to use the "d word"!) @Eddie O'Neil seconded? Any info on coloured flasks? Just received my stainless flask here in Toronto! It's as awesome as I had expected. Many thanks! @Fred Just wondering what the status is on the colored flasks! Still waiting…my FRED @Jeremy C. yep guilty as charged. Missed that one and did not check before I wrote. Keep up the good work! @Jon.. read updates mate.. not really that much silence going on here. Thanks Chris, So I am backer # 89 ordered 1 stainless. No news at all. @Jon read the last update from one week ago. Come on ... where is my bottle? I don't mind the delay, but I do mind the silence. I sympathise that this is much more complicated than anyone realises, really! But keep me updates please. @Chris Reed, what were the instructions on cleaning the flask? Blue box at the bottom of the screen, it says view pledge. Np Sorry guys, newbie here. How do you know your backer number? Cheers! Still no delivery Sorry, clean the flask, not flaws Minor update: the creator already sent me a message with instructions on how to properly clean the flaws and remove the taste. I'm very impressed with how quickly the message came through. As a whole, very happy with my flask and the responsiveness of the creators Received mine. Looks and works great. I had an issue where after the first use, things started to taste a bit metallic. Going to try doing some cleaning to see if it solves the problem @Alex, I am backer #2325 in the US and pledged for one brushed and still have not received my flask. I think the shipping order got mixed up. I'm just hoping that by the time I get my flask the manufacturing problems will be resolved. @Alex: I had pledged for only 1 brushed. And you? How can backer #2359 has already received his flask in the Netherlands while I'm #294, also living in the Netherlands, and I'm still waiting? Im surprised at the lack of patience with some people. I believe you are going to get your flasks. Just wait a small bit. Delays are inevitable in manufacturing a new product. I guess it doesn't matter that I'm backer #27 really cause I still have no flask... Still waiting for my flasks! Have send you guys a message - no response till today! Go to: <url>… Klick the blue "+" on the right side from the project Choose "Survey" Choose "Change Adress" G'day Fred. I have been scanning the comments to find your ansewer the changed adress issue. I couldnt find it. What is the process to change my shipping adress? Thanks haydn Backer #2359 from The Netherlands checking in. Just received my well packaged Fred Water Flask from the postman at the door. There is some slag on the inside of the bottle, near the seams, but nothing to worry about. On the outside a near perfect bottle. Mine is not leaking. I love it's shape and format. It's now (cap off) holding luke-warm water with a drop of washing-up for the night to have the metallic taste removed. @Shannon: have you tried to use the trick with the 2nd washer (from the other cap) to put on top of the first, to be able to use the lanyard, without leakage? This has been mentioned multiple times as a solution. Anyone know how to change my shipping address? I'll be moving in 2 weeks and it's starting to sound like it won't be here before then. Thanks for the update! I have used FRED water bottles for nearly 10 years so I was super excited to get it in stainless. Got my flask a few weeks ago and I am super happy. I throw it in my purse or bag and it doesn't take up to much room. Plus if I have pockets I can put it in there for quick access. I have not been able to use the flask with the strap because of the leak. Do hope you figure that one out because it was super convenient to balance carrying a ton of stuff and holding Fred when I didn't have a bag or a pocket. I am going to try using the strap on my old Fred plastic bottle since that is the one I still carry around the office. Stainless steal Fred was not big enough for the amount of water I drink at work. Inside of the flask has too much slags.it is really bothering.safety issuesm hi... im backer 1240 i live att indonesia, and havent got the flask. It would seem that you are not the only one having trouble with their China based manufacturer. Maybe it's time to go back to USA manufacturing with all the problems your are having ??? Would have paid more to have mine on time. I really appreciate the honest update. Keep up the good work and I look forward to receiving my flask in time for the spring/summer yard work. Thanks heaps for the update guys. I'm thirsty just thinking about the flask Thanks for the update Fred team & also thanks for going through the flasks with a fine toothed comb For those of you that have not received your flask as of yet - it will be worth the wait. Have had mine for a couple of weeks now and it doesn't leak, looks great, and really helps me hydrate while working. I should have posted earlier, but in seeing some of the comments I felt that this was the time. As previous posters have said, calm down, you did not invest your life savings in this flask. We all would have wanted them earlier but I totally agree that receiving a great product was worth the wait. The bottle is mint. I traveled with mine and worked in the yard with it in the back pocket and no leaks. Some think I am guzzling vodka from a big flask which makes for good conversation at the airport. Best bottle I have had hands down. just a shipping update, how many flasks are already out, how many are left (brushed/colored), how many are shipped per day... still nothing. Any update on colored flasks? Can't wait to receive mine. I've been drinking way too many fizzy drinks lately :P @Andrew Robinson - There are likely many, many people who are loving their flasks. The old adage in marketing is that people who have a bad experience will tell twenty others, where people who are satisfied will tell two. The feedback you're seeing here is almost certainly skewed. I have not received mine yet, and have just scrolled down the list of comments. I have to say, it's appearing to be more negative than positive. I'll wait to see what happens, but feeling less confident of the product. Im happy to be proved wrong. @Xiao Yes :) Got my flask yesterday (brushed finish, U.S.). Love most everything about it, no issues with welds or the cap (which fits perfectly). Sadly, there is a pinhole leak on the neck of the bottle just below the threaded portion. No big deal, I'm sure Fred will address it. Otherwise, it's a great bottle - I can't wait to get one I can put into regular use. Hey guys....I received my flask in the mail yesterday and just opened the box. I love it! There is only one problem...there is a spot on the bottom where it is leaking from. Please let me know how you would like me to proceed from here. Thanks...I am not worried about the Fred Water crew taking care of it. @guy has your flask shipped with USPS LJxxxxxxxxxUS to the UK? James, my package was last scanned on Monday/Tuesday saying it had left CA, i got it yesterday in the UK. Says it has not yet been delivered. Ugh, USPS Is notorious for losing mail without a tracking number... :/ UK: It was sent in a brown box with USPS on the top with the flask in side. via Royal Mail USA: It was sent in a USPS mail box via USPS> @everyone who got their flasks -- what was the shipping method? UPS? USPS? Fedex? Was it in your mailbox or front door? Thanks. Ann, I am a U.S. backer, received my flask, no email, it just showed up. Hi. I received my flask yesterday. I have some concerns about the side seams. I'm not sure how to contact you. I am hoping you can email or message me if I post here. Thank you. US backers who have received there bottles. Did you get a tracking number when the bottle shipped? I'm just curious. I have not heard anything yet. Backer # 2325 brushed steel. Just got my Fred Flask. I'm in the UK and it is perfect. Fred I have to hand it to you :) What do i do with the stickers? :P Oh and they shipped it out on Sunday/Monday and it got to me from CA to Midlands, England in 5 days. Pretty nifty. Finally received my fred flask today. I feel like the cap doesn't screw on very securely, but other than that, I like it. dane - the delay is not the problem :) the informations are :) just a shipping update, how many flasks are already out, how many are left (brushed/colored), how many are shipped per day... that´s the difference to amazon, informations. #1,222 -just received my flask in the mail today! Lovin it already :) This user's account has been deleted. People, stop getting so upset over the delays. Things happen, this is Kickstarter not Amazon. These are also water bottles and nothing life changing. Give the team a break and wait patiently... Any updates.... Backer #154. Nothing, not even an email, received. Sent PM. No response so trying here. #1851 in the UK. Had no notifications or updates in a couple of weeks. Are we going to get any information? Color update please? What's the deal with colors????? Update pleeeaaaasssseeee Shouldn't have to beg. @ecogrl thanks, yeah I got a color & brush so I'm beat till the color get done but I'm ok with it taking longer if the QA process is really picking out the perfect ones for us, but a lil update on the color shipping due date would be cool monkey - klar hatten sie das geschrieben, aber wieso schreiben sie dann sowas wie an melissa? sie haben gesagt es sind ein paar aus der reihe getanzt...aber nunja. any update about the shipping progress would be nice. how many brushed are shipped already, how many left... at least THIS should be possible to tell us. Sad to say I'm backer #359 who was willing to forgo my color choices just to get three brushed flasks faster. Sad end to story is it didn't make one bit of difference no tracking number no flasks no update:( I think they were still qc'ing the colored flasks as of the last update. So far as I know, none of the colored have shipped yet... Yeah, bummer, mine are colored :-( I 2nd that question! Has anyone received a colored flask? How does it look? I am waiting to receive my notification of shipment. Hi Fred Any update on delivery at all? I haven't heard anything or received a tracking number. I've been aching to fit water in my back pocket for months !!! :( Aussie backer 2972. So, admittedly a bit low down the order, but I am also interested in some sort of update as to arrival time. Cheers Backer #396 in the UK and to say I am happy is an understatement!! It's everything I wanted and more, no slag inside, stands up perfectly. I did have a small leak once I fitted the lanyard over the neck of the flask but that was operator error. Below is @Freds fix for it. Would love another one in the future if a discount code comes my way.....HINT HINT!!! ;0) You need to place the washer from the other cap on top of the washer in the cap you are using. Make sure the washer is placed curved side facing the top of the cap on both washers. Voila! Can anyone explain how to put the lanyard on? I read comments on that being a problem but I can't seem to find a way to fix it. Hi Fred Team, I have been asked to verify my shipping address on January 5th, but have seen nothing else. Can you please give me an update on my brushed steel flask? I'm with Greg. I'm around the #450-500 and from australia and have no info about my order. And trying to contain my frustration. Please give us all a new update and idea of how it is all going. Thanks Hello. I'm backer #504 and have heard nothing. Can I get an update? Thanks. Updates on colored flasks? Third time asking this question, In a previous update you had some color matching issues with army green was this fixed?? @Fred thanks for the reply in messages. Appreciate how painful this quality issue must be for you to get right but that does reassure me that you are going above and beyond to get the quality just right for us customers. You mentioned that my stainless steel flask is about 3 to 4 weeks away from being shipped depending if all goes to plan. Feel relieved to now know this. I will continue to wait patiently as I know once I receive it I will be more than stoked! Thanks again for the update Backer number is in the 1800's Oh, I pledged for a brushed (no color). Backer #2359 from the Netherlands here. Just received my tracking number. I will patiently wait for this beautiful bottle to arrive and to use. Agreed @monkeypunch @all: You should come down on this tracking number issue. Fred stated that we get our number when the flask is on its way to you. No tracking number = No shipment yet. Have a little trust.... Deshalb ergibt es auch kein Sinn zu erzählen bei welcher Nummer sie sind.:sz: @Frederic Heuper: Das Team von Fred hatte ein Problem mit ihrem Computerprogramm und die Nummer sind nicht mehr in der richtigen Reihenfolge. Hat Fred am 10. April hier aber auch geschrieben, einfach mal runter scrollen... This is really strange again: "@melissa You are in the queue but your backer number is on the high end. Should not be too much longer." but you´re not able to tell us which backer # is last shipped today? or yesterday? How's those colored flasks comming? @Fred I've dropped you a message last week regarding an update on the flask water bottle but you have not got back to me. I've read that small delay did occur in producing the bottles but never was asked my address did I miss the email or something. Many thanks @Fred: I understand that you cannot answer every single question regarding individual tracking numbers or shipping information but would it be possible to get a general update? I believe that a lot of people are interested in the status of the colored flasks. Thanks in advance. @Fred Hi I would like to check the tracking number for my flask, as I only ordered a stainless steel flask. Thanks. @Fred just wondering what the status is on the colored flasks! I am really excited to start using this! @fred hello team, no news from you since the end of the campaign. Hope I get a tracking number very soon. all the best from France hey~ i want to get my tracking number !!! please, message to me..;;; Hi, I sent you guys a message but no reply. Could I please have a tracking number emailed to me? Can you tell me how far I am in queue? I only ordered a stainless steel flask. Thanks. Fred, I need an email address from you in order for paypal to send you a request for refund. Thanks, Linda Grishman I have not received a tracking number or any shipping information! It seems people are receiving their flasks, but I've heard nothing! I've been using my flask for the last two weeks. And it is fantastic. It makes me look like I'm drinking booze on he job, except I don't drink often. I'm glad I can stop using plastic cups at work. I really hope this bottle outlives all the other ones I've bought and stashed into the closet after a few weeks. And so far, it's looking good. Hi I sent a message No reply since 12 days ago... Hi Creator, I haven't got my reward. Can I have the tracking number please? Private message sent days ago but no reply yet. Thanks, @fred sorry, I double check my survey. It is not locked but always open as for country code. But I do not know whether my flask has been posted before 20 April (whenever I have to change my address and country again). Shall I receive email with tracking number once dispatch? Thank you! @fred when i changed my address in the survey form in February, the country code was locked (now it is unlocked), I am not sure whether my flask has been posted or not, or whether it has been shipped to the wrong country but correct address. Please help, fred. @fred Has my #56 stainless brushed water flask been shipped? I change my address (country inc.) today (20 April) from China to UK. Hopefully this change will not disrupt my shipment. Please response if you can. Thank you! LOVE IT! THANK YOU Please provide update on status of shipments .. @Xiao email from Fred with USPS tracking number @dave you get email notice or DM on tracking number? I think I may explode with anticipation!!!!! Tracking says it's now in the UK postal system!!! hi... im backer 1240 i live att indonesia, and havent got the flask. I received my flask and used today. But I found a tiny crack on the bottom of it and water leaks from this crack. Please exchange to the new one. I haven't received my early bird brushed steel...is it shipped yet? Thanks for the info! Super Helpful, can't wait! Keep up the good work:) Do we get any notification when ours is shipped or does it just turn up one day? Awesome colors are close ! I'm hearing good things on the recent Fred flasks being shipped ... Sounds like the new QA process is sifting through well and sending nothing but perfection! Now that's worth the wait! Can't wait Have all the brushed stainless steel bottles shipped. I am backer 2325 and have not heard anything. I'd love any type of update on the colored ones. If they'll be super late I want to know. I'll be leaving from my college address and need to know if I have to change that. any updates on the colored ones ? ok-so you ship the brushed flasks randomly and not after backer #? that was not clear till now... ´cause: backer numbers are not sequential....vs When we made the labels within pledges for brushed steel bottles only, the label making program mixed up the order of the backers and so some did receive bottles out of order. We cannot guarantee exact accuracy but we are trying. (q was why a 4000 got his bottle already but a 2000 not). I live in Canada and got mine today. I was starting to worry after reading some of the comments about quality. I shouldn't have. It's good looking and high quality. Feels great in the hand! Well done guys! Status on colors? Thank you I live in Canada and I haven't got my flask yet This is a follow up to my previous negative comment. After soaking it for a day, using both washers for the strap and testing several flat surfaces and other locations on the wobble, I took Fred on it s first journey as a portable and Eco Friendly option for hydration. I must say, Fred is turning heads and generating a lot of talk, speculation, and comments. Fred is holding its own and doing quite well in the Corporate office environment only after proving I was not drinking alcohol and promising the "F" really stood for FRED!!! Our acceptance was complete and our day continued just like any other day except for the fact we had a new companion. Even after hours brought more interaction from others about Fred and how they too could obtain one. End of day, Fred had been filled up and emptied too many times to count and was a smash hit. Good job Team. Got my steel flask today in the UK - it's beautiful! Perhaps the best finish of any project that I have backed. Absolutely chuffed to bits, well done Team Fred! If you have time to post here on the comment wall in response to people getting their bottles. Please understand we know you can respond to messages and are refusing to do so. What's the word on the marsala? Got my flask today. Outstanding! Really excellent craftsmanship and evident attention to detail. Looks like a price of art. Those of you who are still waiting, be patient. I've backed projects that have been duds with poor execution or over a year delay. I must say I'm very impressed with the Fred Flask team! Push that blue button at the bottom that says view pledge how do we find out what number backer we are? Give these people a break, I too was a bit miffed at not getting mine when I thought I was supposed to, but they are doing the very best they can. You won't be disappointed, read adam's notes, he explains everything in detail about he shipping etc. Got my two brushed, they are awesome!! 1 single brushed steel ordered backer #396 in the UK and just got confirmation it was posted April 14th. Hello everybody ... I'm #4209 ... love what you are doing, inspired me to create my own project ... I hope you'll share it when the time is right. In the meantime, any ETA on my bottle? Woot! Thanks Quinn for the vid. Thumbs up. In addition to my earlier comment I pledged for 1 x brushed steel flask in case anyone was wondering Hi backer #1846 here. I live in Australia and have not received any delivery information. I also sent a message several days ago without reply so just wondering how it's looking? P.s. Luv ya work! @Quinn Hall cool!!tx for the video.. :3 I posted a video of my unboxing... <url>´cause every question, which # is out, gets ignored :( with 1500 bottles out till tomorrow (friday), we all should get our stainless. or nearly all (i just expect that most of the "2 or more" -rewards wait ´cause of one with color, that´s why i don´t count them). @jeremy spray can you provide your backer # and general location? Just curious, thanks Mine arrived on Friday, and it is GLORIOUS! Thank you so much for focusing on a quality product! this flask is EXACTLY what I hoped it would be, and I could not be happier! Thank you! @Adam Alter, because people nowadays often associate expected return with entitlement, not so much unplanned circumstances as accepted risks. @Adam I'm glad someone finally said it. It's hard to wait and I'm also very anxious but I appreciate their concern for quality, I imagine they've been just as frustrated, if not more. Why is everyone so damn impatient? They're working hard on getting the production out. Things came up to delay it and they're dealing with it. I'm sure they're doing everything they can to get this out as soon as possible. This is the risk of backing something on kickstarter. Not everything always goes on planned. Just chill out and it will come when it comes. Any updates? I have sent 2 emails, no reply. No updates. Is this even real? Pretty bummed on this. Hi backer #1846 here. I live in Australia and have not received any delivery information. I also sent a message several days ago without reply so just wondering how it's looking? P.s. Luv ya work! Just read the label program mixed up the shipping orders... Hopefully you guys work out your software. Nothing worse than following up delays in manufacturing with shipping issues. Backer 1,022 here. Backed a stainless flask in California. No email and no flask yet. Are you guys shipping in order or just random? Submitted my survey almost instantly so not sure what method you guys are using. Would be helpful if you let us all know. Thanks. You guys know what we bought isn't proprietary or that special right? I spent $25 on a water bottle. So what? I've got 4+ waiting in my kitchen right now. Who cares? If you want one bad enough you don't mind waiting. But @creator I still want one asap! :D No update on coloured flasks and from the feedback these have been getting in the comments, I'm starting to regret this. @creator I'm also curious about colored flasks ETA. I'm backer #1997 with one charcoal black flask, and I can't wait for it! I understand the issues, thanks for keeping us updated as much as you guys have. Good luck! When is the projected time for the colored flasks? Thank you for hearing my problem and for the refund! :) @Creator Still no email to confirm my stainless flask has been shipped? Can you confirm its shipment please. Backer #396 UK. I am backer number #2287 haven't received mine.. @fred thank for the reply. At least please let me know whether my #56 flask has shipped and when you post it? Couldn´t you give us just an update, which # you are on? It´s only interesting for stainless-backers of cause, but I would love to see any overseas-confirmation. How many flasks have been shipped out so far? I'm #2028 and it's day 11. Any sign of the colored bottles being sent out? @Creator - I've been sending you emails and private message since April 06. It seems you have been ignoring my issues and don't want to reply at all. Please advise. Thank you. I don't know how many times I have done this: I am in China and I wonder whether you feel convenient to send mine brushed flask to me this week from your Chinese production line? I am #56 and have to leave China next Wednesday (22 April). So long but no reply from you in any ways. Thank you! (My ks name is the recipient for package) I'm here in New Mexico and still haven't received mine. So being backers #294 living in the Netherlands, when can I expect mine? I can't really find an answer in the updates I'll post this again for all those who don't know: TO GET RID OF THE METALLIC TASTE... All you do is fill the bottle completely fully of water, add one drop of dish soap and then let it sit overnight with the CAP OFF. Done. Boom. Over. Or you could google or YouTube this problem, fix it, and stop whining about a non-issue. At least you have your flask. You're welcome. Hi - I'm backer 1032, but have yet to receive a shipping confirmation (or the flasks themselves). Any idea on on ETA? Thanks I'm a backer #1247 and am in the US. Still have not received my two stainless flasks. Messaged creator 4 days ago (April 9, 2015) requesting tracking number because of this comment: "If you want to know, message us with the name on the "ship to" and we can look it up. Sometimes different names are used as kickstarter usernames - making it difficult." But I have still not received a reply. Horrible metallic taste! I threw away $30?? Received mine and like many others, it looks cool, wobbly, metallic taste, cap does not screw on smooth. They actually feel warped when threading them on the neck or the flask neck is warped. Not really happy about having to double up on the cap insert to use the strap. I guess this is the risk vs reward portion of Kickstarter. Know... Yes please if any overseas backers get theirs, let us know. Couldn´t you give us just an update, which # you are on? It´s only interesting for stainless-backers of cause, but I would love to see any overseas-confirmation. In Oklahoma still waiting for my stainless steel flask :( nobody believes it exists can't wait to get mine the only store in town quit selling the plastic one so i cant recommended anything can't wait to get this off the ground @creator I sent a message to you regarding my email address updates and so far I haven receive anything yet, from Hong Kong, with love. @creator apologies, told UK #396 sent out on the 9th April. However still no email to confirm this!. @Christopher got told that they only started to ship overseas on the 9th April!! I'm #396 and in the UK but no flask and no email to say it's been dispatched yet. Any news on overseas backers? I came in around the 1800 mark and i've had no email or any information? I could care less about the tracking just hope I get one that doesn't have slag blobs inside & cap fits & stands up!! Are you sending out tracking numbers when the bottles are sent? Still waiting :( Got mine yesterday. Beautiful and beyond cool. It is coming with me today everywhere I go. IT CAME IT CAME IT FINALLY CAME! (that's what she said) My Fred Flask arrived on Thursday and it's just as awesome as I hoped it would be. It was packed perfectly in a box. I received two dope stickers and a strap for the flask. The flask is flawless. I truly believe that each one was inspected individually. Coming with two caps is really handy as well. I can't wait to start using my flask all the time. Thanks Fred! PS I'm located in San Francisco if anyone is wondering how it arrived so quickly. @Creator - I've sent you a few messages privately. Can you please reply? Thank you. @brian what model did you get? Got mine. Love love love it. Only concern is that it wobbles when standing upright. but what # u r on at the moment? is there anyone from overseas with shipping informations? Thanks for the quick response. I was just wondering what happened. Are you sending tracking information? If so I haven't received any notice that the bottle shipped. My backer number is in the lower 2000s and I noticed that backers in the 4000s have already received their bottle. What if I don't have a working dishwasher? I'm loving the flask but I have to agree with some of the comments so far that the metallic smell and taste is quite strong. Any ideas on fixes? @TheSanFrancisco Finally someone mentioned the metallic smell when drinking out of the flask. I thought it was just me, so I refrained from posting. I can't stomach the smell. I've tried soaking the flask in baking soda/water solution and it still smells. I have a stainless steel coffee mug and there is no metal smell whatsoever. QA is substantial and we all appreciate it. Patience is a virtue. But effective communication at this moment is the paramount on Kickstarter. Thank you! I am not sure whether any backers outside the U.S. have received flasks by now, as those recipients reported here are all US residents as I recall (except those without identifying themselves). I think you creators probably should let international backers know whether their rewards have already been shipped (even part of them in pledge order ) when handling native post. Or you decide to ship them respectively based on nationalities if this is the case. It is obvious people feel frustrated when we see others locals get their flasks while we not receive anything like email and tracking number. Yea I'm just hoping it gets here by the end of next month as I'm moving at the end of May I'm in the same boat as the other UK guys. I think USPS take around 10 days depending on what shipping they selected. Got mine two nights ago. It does stand up. Had some fun with the bubble wrap. I am #3900ish and only had stainless steel flask. Two things. When I put in the Lanyard and tighten the cap, it leaks a little with both caps. But that's not a problem for me. Both caps fit tightly for the most part. Second, I can see the blackish color welding on the inside and wondering if that is contributing to the metallic taste from the water I put in. Anyone else? Overall, it's a great product. 4.5/5 I pledged for a color and had the option of choosing brushes stainless for a color. I chose brushed stainless. Name is Kenneth Potts 7537 Sol Ct 32822 any idea when it's going to ship?? I got mine. Thanks. @Justin I was also wondering the same thing, apparently international rewards are being sent out today. Just wondering, does anyone in the UK has theirs yet? Got mine today(SF Bay) Beautiful, but a few problems. The threading has a crunchy feel, grinds as I screw it on, is not smooth at all. And one of the caps has a nasty brown stain on the silicone. I got mine yesterday (SF Bay Area). Everything seems fine. It stands up, top screws on well, and looks great. I'm ready to start using it. Thanks! forgot to mention I'm in Orange County, CA Backer #4596 and just got mine right now. No problems with the item and looks awesome! Can't wait to use it. @FRED WATER Private message sent, eagerly awaiting your reply. I have not had an email yet and I'm around 2000 backer. @P.H @FRED WATER No I pledged for a brushed but still no email!! @FRED WATER any idea why? Has it even been shipped? Would be nice to know if it's on its way. @Dave was your a colored one? I have a crazy early backer number as well but I pledged for a color one so nothing yet. To all that have recieved their flask did you get an email saying it had been dispatched? I thought they were being dispatched in backer order? Just wondering why backer #4042 has recieved their flask and as backer #396 I haven't even had an email saying it as been dispatched yet!! I am in the UK so didn't expect to get it quickly but did expect it to be posted by now! Thanks for the reassurance. After seeing some of the comments, I was going to see if I could wait to get mine until improvements were made. Thank you also for the continued activity on the comment feed. :) Dang I really hope my bottle will be able to stand. @creator please fix these issues before sending out further bottles. Sounds like you guys are on it. While I understand the onerous endeavors and admire your efforts, I do think Shane has a point. Unless someone's making a water bottle shaped like a ball, the function to stand firmly upright without tipping over is just an implicit feature of any bottle regardless of size. Not sure if this issue can be easily resolved. I set the bottle down for a moment while grabbing my phone. Tipped over. If you feel you will never ever set the bottle down without its cap, so be it (though I doubt that will be the case in reality). That said, I expect I would (and have) set mine down from time to time with the top off and it being filled with liquid. Cap not fitting flush with the body is just a lack of attention to detail. Oh well. Kickstarters. What can you do. Nice attempt though. Has potential. please check more stringently. having such quality issues not only makes us disappointed, but worse, spoils your reputation. Got mine yesterday in NY. I can feel the interior weld bead, but not sure why it would be a problem as it isn't flaking off. Fits great in my pocket or bag and can't think of a reason to leave it standing up with the cap off as I thought it was marketed for the on the go water bottle not the desk bottle. Overall super pumped about the quality and execution of the project. I had such high hopes for these.....:( Additionally, the welding inside is not clean at all. I received my brushed bottle and I am VERY disappointed in the quality. The cap doesn't sit flush on one side when twisted close. This is due to an obvious imperfection in the bottle top area. Secondly, the bottle is incredibly unstable when setting it down on a flat surface. You have to be careful when setting it down or it will tip over and spill. Definitely not worth the money in its current form. As much as I was bummed I hadn't gotten my brushed cause I also got a colored one with it I'm now thankful I wasn't one of the first to get these! Maybe I won't get the ones with slag drops inside along welding bead! Blessing in disguise I hope! Backer 1,001 for a brushed bottle. Nothing yet. Staying tuned. Got mine today! Stuck it right in my butt pocket and went for a walk. So much better than a water bottle! Thanks guys! I'm backer 277, haven't received my flasks yet. I'm not that far away from you, what's up? Would be better if people are willing to post carrier, location (country), backer's number; so it'd be easier to interpolate shipping times for everyone. I'm #210 brushed steel but haven't heard anything yet. Hey guys I sent you a message please take a look and get back with me. Received mine! Lovely! i would like to know if my address change has been recieved as we will be leaving our current address soon. have tried multiple times to make contact,please confirm. I just received the bottle right on time and it looks beautiful! Question, I see there is some burn marks where welded area of inside of the bottle. Is there anyways to clean it up? Thanks! What postal service was used for the international shipping? I'm in the UK. Good point @Brad H, sometimes it's better to be last then first. I seem to have gotten lucky, no weld seems on the outside, and no slag, bumps, or voids that I can see. I'm backer #154 and haven't received anything. Patience people. It probably just means you'll end up receiving a better looking product than those that got theirs already anyway. I'm backer #1574 and still haven't received anything. :( Just wondering if there is anyway to find out if you have sent mine out, as just trying to get an idea on time. Got mine today It looks great. I plan on using it tommorow. Best of luck Got mine today. Looks great. I don't see any slag on the inside but I see the faint weld marks/lines. Nothing enough to bother me. Thanks for the quick shipping. Looking forward to using it on a trip to New Orleans and Boston at the end of the month. Got my FF a few days ago and have been giving it paces. It has a nice weight to it when full and is a pleasure to hold. I'd like to get another one down the road, with a color to help add some extra protection. Mind you it is quite sturdy. If you dislike seeing finger grease and the like then go this route as well. I am glad the lid has such a rounded edge at the seam, with the carrying strap around the mouth it gets pinched quite a bit to ensure a seal. A sharper edge would have demolished the band already with the use I have given it in such a short time. For me the strap is not an option and makes carrying MUCH easier. The bottom of the flask doesn't sit quite as flat as I would like, and tends to rocks front to back if I stand it up. Honestly that is just me nit picking. Thank you for the hard work, and very fast production turn around. Backer #4042, U.S, Oregon. I'm backer #4389. Where do I fall on the list of shipments which # u r on? Got no notificatin till now. :( Happy Easter anyway :) I have a question. If the bottle does have slag inside can I snap a couple pics and just mail it back for a refund? I don't have any plans to keep a defective product. Mouse over and click on the vertical photo in my link below to see Fred Flask in cupholder adapter. Got mine Friday. Love it. Wouldn't fit in my Jeep's cupholder so I printed an adapter. Photos and download of files to print your own here: <url>"slag" on the inside left side on the weld leading up to the mouthpiece. Doesn't bother me since its inside and the only way to feel it is to go looking for it but it would have been nicer to not have it there. Other than that looks great! Yes the bump is in fact Slag. Hello Gentlemen, I did receive my bottle today And I appreciate that. I did want to point out that the bottle is a bit rudder then I would hope some of the welds are visible from the outside, especially the right side, also some minor pitting on the back of the bottle lastly, there is something ruff near the mouth piece. Received mine in the northeast yesterday. Flask arrived safely, no damages, but add me to the list for replacement. I too have slag near the mouth. It is pretty gross actually so I don't think I will be drinking any water out of it but it looks good otherwise. All they need to do is revamp the QA process so the upcoming flasks won't have the same problem and therefore, less replacements. Amateurs. New address info sent to private message. Please check. Thx @sf, thanks for the correct term: "slag" .... @Fred Water --- what do I need to do to get a replacement? Thanks. I was fortunate enough to receive my flask today. However, much like sf, I ran into the same issue with excess slag near the mouth of the flask. Aside from that, my flask had a few indentations either from shipping (It was crammed into a small USPS Flat Rate Box) and/or how it was stored/handled at the manufacturer. I was planning to order another for the powder-coated version. However, I'll see what happens with this first. It feels sturdy despite the other issues mentioned above. <url>#3,268 how to update my address, please answer Got mine today! I'm number 127. No sharp bits on the inside. Really enjoying using it. Thanks, Fred Team! Congrats on the progress, I can't wait for my flask! One request - I've moved, and need to update my address. How do I do that? Thanks! Sara, Fred Flask Enthusiast Someone make a video review and post it to youtube! And the interesting part of this manufacturing defect is 4 out of the 5 I ordered have the slag, and it's in the same spot inside the bottle. Right where the bottle neck meets the bottle. Hey Fred Water, The bumps as you call it, is welding slag leftover from manufacturing. Mine have it too.NOT COOL.!!! Regards sf Fred Fred Fred!!! Where was the update to say shipping has begun? We appreciate you're busy busy busy but it should be all about your backers and keeping us in the loop. How about letting us know how many have been shipped and what backer number you're up to. It's not the bumps I'm referring to, but rather very sharp metal and what looks like fine wire sticking out around the area where the threaded top section meets the main body. Not sure if I can get a photo of it (more than one piece...quite sharp, but flexible) @james - no idea of my number, but i do happen to live very close to Fred HQ, so it was only in the mail 1 day @toladib thanks for the warning!!! by the way, what number were you? Mine just arrived. Looks great. Haven't tested it out yet. Just a warning to folks, there's some really sharp metal on the inside (i assume left over from the welding process). Be careful if you try to feel the surface texture on the inside.......easy to get cut/poked. Looking forward to getting my two flasks soon!! I'm getting excited for this little guy to arrive, I is truly appreciate your attention to detail. This I understand creates delays but I would rather have that then have to ship it back. This is still my favorite Kickstarter video as well. Start send out Kickstarter reward now? No email received. At least some of them please... Thanks for all the hard work, Fred team! One small criticism: if you're going to share news about progress, can you put it under "Updates" so that we don't have to look through all of these comments to see what's going on? There hasn't been an Update since last week. Given that the expected timeline is delayed again, a global update would be much appreciated. Thanks for the update. Please keep us posted. :) What is the shipping method for overseas customers? UPS, USPS, DHL, FedEX? I'd happlily pay more for tracked delivery than USPS Attention to detail, sounds fine to me. Keep up the good work guys n gals... Good work chaps! By the sound of it you've had to move mountains to get this project forward. But as Winston Churchill said "If you are going through Hell; keep going!" Well done and fair play! 3 days of 2x8 shifts packing and sending, anyone got that magical email saying their flask is on its way? cant wait for my new bottle less sugar!!!! Love the colours and it might take a while to get to Australia but really looking forward to my new hydration delivery system. Oh my! #172 and I ordered brushed! So stoked! #198 but I will patiently wait for the colors @brian if you go into your backer history and select the fred water flask project you'll see your backer number. Where do I find my backer number? #1836 ... brushed... could you update us which # was the last today? :D #396 in the UK wonder how long my brushed steel will take? YEAHHHH I'm backer #260.......... But wait I got a two pack which included a color flask.......I'm not getting Sh#t no matter what my number is :( tears in heaven .... Yay! I'm #210! Soon soon! omfg I can't wait to fill this with vodka n drink till I throw up on a cop.... Thursday! :) Flasks? So all flasks have to be shipped from sfo? Impossible for Chinese backers to have ones directly from mainland China? Am I right? People and their patience, adorable. Hey Adam what's your issue with NOT answering private messages? Messaged you three times now and no response. Really WTF? I have sent a DM for a color change. please reply I have sent a DM for an address change. No reply yet. Likewise, I also requested a change of color to ORANGE. Can you pls confirm. Thanks very much... I sent a DM on 3/17 requesting to change mine from charcoal to brushed steel and have had no response. Can you please confirm the change in order? Thanks. Does this include the coloured ones? or just the brushed steel? How's it going guys? Any chance of an update? update? First come first ship from the states starting March 11. 1 week from land date for the rest. And now since 6 days in transit? Please, what happend? For people wondering about the "metal taste" that comes from new water bottles like our amazing Fred Water Flask, I have a solution! It's an easy trick that I learned a few years ago, and have used it several times since. Do so at your own risk, haha. All you do is fill the water bottle completely full of water and then add a single drop of the dish soap of your choice and let the bottle sit overnight (or a full 24 hours for best effect). Do not put the cap on the bottle, just let it sit full of water without capping it or anything. Hope this helps! In addition, I worry about the color, because within packets collision and fell to the ground, will knock off color, reveal the inside parts, will be very ugly, because be used outdoors, it is difficult to avoid the bump I am in China, can directly from the Chinese delivery, also can save time and shipping. They look good...but I am not liking that army green at all. Any chance I could switch to charcoal? I'm backer 4119 and so's my wife! Sorry that was a very poor attempt at an" I'm Spartacus!" joke. I know very poor indeed. No! I'm backer 4119! Er...the powder coat colours look amazing. Is it too late to purchase additional flasks? Can we see the white please? Sorry, I'm backer 4119. Can I pls change my army green to the ORANGE? Just fell in love with that color. I ordered a charcoal black flask, but I realize I'd prefer a less dark color; I'd like to switch mine to white if it's possible to get a different color, but if it's only possible to switch from color to brushed, I'd like to do that instead. Okay so to anyone who's not sure what's going on: The bottles are coming to the Fred building from the factory. Fred will then package them and send them to us. I'm glad I picked the kickstarter green. It rocks :P Looked at the new update and I've got to ask, is it possible to change from brush steel to one of the sweet colours? Really great job on them, they're all gorgeous! Can we change from steel to colour flask? Looking forward to receiving my bottles. Have a dad and son trip planned on 19th Apr. I've recently moved. How can I update my address? If my order has already shipped that is fine. Thank you for your assistance. i think they´re still @fred water and not send out. guys..if you´ve got problems, just TALK to us :/ you were online 2 days ago. I am backer 4887. Given that the project states there is only 4623 backers I challenge anyone to be a backer greater than I am! Suffice to say... Once I've got mine everyone should be sorted! Has anyone gotten theirs? Holy sh!t I'm backer 27! Yeah would love to hear about the sleeve for these becoming a reality......leather or whatever it may be Where do things stand regarding the development of a cover/koozie to fit the flask? It would be nice if this cover had attachment points for an optional shoulder strap. The shoulder strap would be useful for slinging the bottle over the headrest of your car seat. Is painting still looking like it will remain on schedule? @richard great thanks! @jared if you go into your backer history and select the project you'll see your backer number just under the project name. @Dave how do you find out what backer you are? Great work guys, backer 396 here in the UK and can't wait for my flask!! Are you still able to ship Chinese backers from inside China? I DM you several times but no confirmation yet. I'm being patient.....very patient.... ....................................................................................... silence. ....................................................................................... FRED WATER: Last login Mar 7 2015 ....................................................................................... Another KS-Project that just fails in keeping backers updated near the final line. Just checking when you will be shipping to Australia. Thanks! Can't wait to get my hands on my two! And for clarification, everyone who ordered a plain steel flask will have it shipped by March 11th? What Jack Green said! Also, how many business days does air shipping take in the states? To anyone who gets theirs before me: Make a youtube video of the unboxing! Soo... How i know which batch i am? or when exactly the item will be sent? Do we get shipping notifications? Like "your bottle is on its way"? :) I dunno if I´m already in the first batch or not... Guess to be more specific SIGG mentioned this in their faq with regards to boiling water. "Can SIGG bottles be used for boiling water? No. Extreme heat can damage the exterior paint. There is also an acute risk of burns as aluminium is a good heat conductor." In other words you don't know the effects of the paint on prolong usage of the bottle with hot water? I'd like to change my color selection from black to brushed. Whats the best method for making this change. Thanks. When can international supporters expect a flask? I'm in the UK, and I haven't seen anything about it in the updates Adding on to daniel's comment on durability. would the paint have any issues with prolong hot water usage? Also i thought from the last update that the caps look different from the pictures in the story page. the pictures in the story page had a glossy finish at the top? is it going to be with the glossy finish or without? thanks for clarifying. =) would it be possible to get a picture of a painted sample ? I'm curious about the durability of the paint finish Just to be clear - I'm sure you're going to deliver an excellent product; it looks great from the photos you've posted so far. Please don't read too much negativity into my posts - they're really not intended that way. Apologies if they've seemed overly critical. Jason - With the best will in the world, the last post I'd read said 'I will post an update tonight'. Then five days passed without an update. That's the kind of thing which causes concern. I completely see what you're saying; clearly it's not vapourware. It's just things like the comment I've just mentioned, along with 'We're going to miss the target date, so we're not going to state another one' which are somewhat frustrating. I don't doubt that ultimately we'll be happy with the flasks when they arrive. They appear to be high quality. I may have missed this point, but what is your advice on cleansing (the inside)? Because in time the inside of stainless steel bottles will smell a little and only rinsing with water won't be sufficiënt. Thanks in advance for your information. Backers-calm down! Its only $29. I am more than satisfied with the pictures of the manufacturing of the Fred Water bottles to understand that production is progressing and this is not "vapor ware" - I.e. A fake project. This manufacturing is taking place overseas and this project does not have an IPhone number of items to allow the creators to push any harder than they currently are. The last post (before today) said they would post again when they had definite dates - and 2 weeks later they did. I was also hoping for the Jan date but receiving the quality product that was promised a month + later works for me. I have a question. I was able to change the 'Address 1' in the survey but not Address 2 and 3. Is there a way that I can confirm all 3 go to the first address? Thanks so much! Project managers or not it takes 5 minutes at most to type a couple of sentences to let your backers know what's going on. I know Fred water is much bigger than this kickstarter project so let's not act like its impossible to appease the few that have given in faith of receiving clear concise information. We can't do more than wait. I'll be honest, I was willing to just let things ride, as I assumed there would be regular updates - particularly as things had gone a little awry. However, it's been two weeks without any meaningful update. I'm a little concerned by '... we are not going to put a new date out there until the bottles are on a plane...' I work on a project team, and if we had something cause a slip in timescale, and responded by saying 'We're going to miss our target date, so we're just not going to set another one' well... the powers that be would chase us up a tree and set fire to it. Please can you give at least a ballpark estimate of delivery. Clearly the manufacturing is well progressed. You must have SOME idea? How Hard is it to give us an update? It's been 13 days!!! since the last Still waiting for that update you said you were posting 3 days ago. I'm excited but updates keep your backers happy and relaxed. hi is this double walled or vacuum insulated? does it get condensation? Give them a break! They're doing all they can! Kudos to the Fred Water Flask team! Can't wait to receive mine :) I'm sure it'll be worth the wait! I have messaged you guys a couple of times with no response. I understand that you are likely working on things. But - is it possible to purchase more of the Fred Flasks at the KS price? I would like to purchase 10-12 more, if possible. Thanks Update please? :) I'm thirsty. @Creator, Thank you I am assured in your dedication to competence and am thrilled to be a part of this project. The product looks cutting edge and I hope to see Fred Water products marketed in Las Vegas some day. How come in the last update they tell you to message them directly but when you do there are no responses? @Soltyk thanks I see that now. Was actually trying to get a gauge on the backer/creater communication on this project. I am certain the product will be stunning and exact. If all else is as it is, in the least the end result should compensate for the means. I would like to add / purchase more bottles. Is it possible to do it at this time, at the kickstarter price? Can we get an update on the progress? I am a bit antsy wondering how much longer I will need to wait. @Dono Boyer III If you look closely at at the picture, quite at the top and slightly blurred, there seems to be what looks like the outer shell of the cap. In the update you shared a few pictures of the manufacturing progress. As shown it looks as though the screw portion of the caps are in progress. Could you affirm that those plain caps are not the finished product. In essence the caps in which the products where marketed had a seamless rounded appearance that flowed with the bottle design and has logo artwork stamped above. This was not mentioned and I would like to know what I should expect to receive from the Fred Water company. If you have the time to respond to a backer that is. I have sent multiple messages since the last update but I haven't heard anything. I am moving really soon and need to change my address. I looked on backer kit, but I guess it need to do it someplace else. How do I change my shopping address? The updates are part of the Kickstarter experience. Personally I like getting the insight into what goes on to get products out to the pledgers. If I receive regular updates and a quality product at the end I'm happy. In the meantime I'll keep replaying the promo video. Makes me smile every time. "I am a patient individual and prefer waiting to receive a Perfect Product as opposed receiving a Sub Standard Product." My sentiments exactly, thanks for the update. The update is much appreciated. I am a patient individual and prefer waiting to receive a Perfect Product as opposed receiving a Sub Standard Product. Please release updates on a more frequent basis. I am sure the "Backers" will appreciate the effort. The update is much appreciated. I am a patient individual and prefer waiting to receive a Perfect Product as opposed receiving a Sub Standard Product. Please release updates on a more frequent basis. I am sure the "Backers" will appreciate the effort. They look awesome! Adam, They look great, no worries from m on the timing, what ever it takes to make them somewhat perfect! Can't wait to start using them! They look good, don't worry about delays I'm moving in a month. Should I change my shipping address? And how would I do that? Thanks for the update. Sounds good! @Adam thank you for the update and response, much appreciated! @Jared I don't see how the amount of projects I've backed applies to the fact that developers of this current project could do the professional courtesy of communicating to backers with daily updates. Like I mentioned, I don't mind waiting at all but I'd rather wait with some reassurance and communication. @ David and James... how many projects have you backed? I have one that should have been delivered in August... Shipping from China has shut down till the 28th of February. If they are getting this from China it could be not until after then. These things take time, and they may not have a solidified date yet. @Jared I think what James, and what all of us are looking for - as stated numerous times earlier in the comments - is consistency in updates. No, no one here wants a product with subpar quality in exchange for speed, however, it is bad business to keep financial backers in the dark to this degree, in both time between updates, and descriptiveness of those updates. I am excited to receive this, was from the beginning, and that has never waned. But I just want information, that is all for now, just consistent, relevant information. @Jared I don't mind waiting at all, but it gets to the point where the shipping process has been consistently delayed and "soon" is the only answer from developers when asked for a shipping date. So, what I'm saying is, a firm shipping date would be nice as well as daily updates just to not keep everyone in the dark. @James what seems shady about a few weeks out? Would you rather have a product that was made poorly and received on time or a product that was made perfectly and a bit late? +1 for knowing when shipping is starting. Looking forward to getting this. I'm also wondering when you're going to ship? I think everyone's been plenty patient and at this point the whole thing seems pretty shady and unprofessional. Soooo how's shipping going? Awesome. I drink Fred Water everyday (I recycle my plastic Fred bottle and use it everyday). Can't wait to use the stainless steel version soon! Quality is worth the wait. Thanks for the update! :D nice, an update! :) Unfortunately I have seen many project creators who were very active and answered many questions readily before the project was funded, but after funding, they just went quiet, sometimes without a single update for months, or just went MIA forever. I do understand that some creators probably are busy preparing for production/manufacturing, but I just feel that the spirit and fun of Kickstarter is the constant creator-backers interaction from the start of the project all the way until the delivery of the final item to the last backer. I'm perfectly fine with silence for up to 3 weeks or even a month, but it'd be nice for a creator, if he cannot afford the time for an update, to post a short comment here once a month maybe, as a "mini-update" to let us know he's still there busy working with the production and things are going smoothly or will be delayed. Typing a few sentences to say "Just to let all you backers know that things are going smoothly" or "Unfortunately there will be some delay. Do expect a one-month delay, due to .....". We Kickstarter backers are all prepared for delays, delays are absolutely fine, we embrace delays, we rather have delays than to have a reward that compromises on quality. We just hope to hear something from the creator, whether good or bad news. I'm very excited about these flasks. I live in San Antonio, Texas. Recently I saw that in our larger HEB markets, you guys have actually been putting the Fred Refillables (not Empties) on the shelf. This is really exciting. I've been carrying around my Refillable for over 2 weeks now. Very convenient sizes bothe the 13 and 20 oz. My question is however, how are you planning to stick to your goal of keeping the Fred Refillables sold in stores from just becoming another tossed empty bottle? Awesome work all the way though. I loved your marketing campaign for the stainless steel flasks. They actually posted the 2 extra colors days before the campaign ended, long before the survey went out. That's why I picked them for my reward. Some people weren't paying attention or thought they needed the colors photoshopped onto the same picture of the flask that they had used for the other colors. The color change requests have been a little annoying... I'm sure to the good folks at Fred Water, too. Yes, they assured us they knew what they were doing with production and there wouldn't be any gigantic delays (+/- 2 weeks) due to their experience and set up but stuff seems to inevitably happen with Kickstarter projects. Having said that, we're right around that 3 week delay window that was mentioned so another update, even a small one, would be nice. The fact they posted the survey without the kickstarter colors helped slow this down well before the issues with the jigs and molds came up. Sorry I know you said there is a three week delay but just wondering if there was yet anything to update... Theo Hey Adam, Been about two weeks since your last update...any news? Theo @Alex 3 weeks is pretty standard in my opinion. I have backed only 2 that were right on target with what they said. @Adam... Amen! @Adam... Amen! @Alex Chai There was an update on the 19th discussing where they were at and delays with the project. They said it would be at least a 3 week delay and were pretty open about what happened. Is this another project where the creator disappears and keeps quiet after the project is successfully funded? Are we gonna have some updates? Where can I change my address @Leo I have only backed a few, but I have had two that were actually on time. Blew my mind... Generally I have found 4 weeks has been the most exact time frame. I am really excited about this one. @Jared-I know the feeling. I've got one that was to be delivered 7 months ago and another that is over a year (we backers figure that one is long gone). I build in an extra month or two when I pledge. Out of over 40 pledges, I did have one deliver early! I'm betting this one will be well worth an extra month or so. @Adam Three weeks is reasonable. I have been waiting 8 months for something that just went into production. How is production going? I'm super excited and glad I chose the stainless - my boyfriend will enjoy this for his bday! The new KS app for iPhone didn't prompt this latest update. Didn't know there was one. Does anybody read the updates? As of 1/19 they are about 3 weeks behind schedule. Things probably won't ship for another week or so. Have the first batch shipped? If so, to early backers? If not, when? Hopefully they start shipping soon hi! friends!! :) when will my products shipped? I have the same concern as Jeremy Hey guys, the shipping address I listed is only going to be my shipping address until January 27th. Based on the last update, I assume it won't be arriving in time. How do I get in contact with you to update the shipping address? I have tried calling, using the web contact form on your website, and also messaging through Kickstarter. I don't want to leave the shipping address in the public comments. Thanks. Thanks for the update! Cannot wait. How is production going on now? @Jess I had the same reaction has you when I saw Jeremy's post. @Jeremy all I saw at first was color change and I was about to get really pissed. Yeah I can't wait for this thing to come out. Hi, Can I change my color to a color not even listed?? JK!! Month almost over!! Looking forward to this big time :) According to the "8 weeks after $50,000 in pledges" time frame, they should be ready to start shipping late next week? @Fred Could you update us with a production schedule ? Team Fred - Thank you for working with everyone that wants to change their color(s). I know you guys will work it all out for everyone who supported you. Rock on, it will all come together. Has the first production bottles been completed? I think you mentioned January delivery. Are we still in time for that? Early backers first? PLEASE READ THE LAST UPDATE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!! Also please quit changing your color. It was supposed to be offered to those wanting the TWO NEW COLORS not an open call to every back letting them change their mind all of a sudden. Did nobody read the last update? You have to message them directly to change your color. They do not want people to ask for color changes in the comments section. My god, why is everybody changing colors.. Can't you just stay with thy color you orginally chose? I hope all this color changing doesn't delay the manufacturing and shipping process. Hi Fred Crew : ) Pertaining to your last message, I would to change my colour choice from a Brushed Steel Flask to a Charcoal Flask, Thanks @Fred go look at the last update Hey Guys, Fred here. Can you please update my color to Kickstarter Greeeen? Thanks!! @Leslie you need to message them directly with your color choice Hi Team Fred. I sent you a message. I want to change my 2 black flasks to 2 white flasks. Cna you update my order. Thanks Leslie Where are you with the production timeline? Are you thinking the estimated delivery dates will be met? thanks I think changing of colors/options shouldn't be a priority but good on Fred for even trying. You pledged knowing the option and selecting a color. It'd be a nightmare for them. Hope to receive them by Feb! @ Lori Yep your already been charge 6usd if you live within the u.s. if you are international you pay 16usd. @Eddy from what I understand Fred will start shipping the first FRED bottles in the first half of February. Between the 7th.-21st. of February let me say that there is always a possibility of a time frame shift. But if we let the FRED team concentrate on getting production ramped up and not worry about questions that will or have been answered already if we just do a little research. Our FRED may be able to arrive a little sooner rather than later. Stay tuned they always will update when a milestone is reached. Hi There! Can I kindly change my Brushed Steel to Marsala please! Much appreciated guys! Hey. Just wondering is there an expected delivery time? PLEASE CHANGE ME FROM BLUE TO KICKSTARTER GREEN?? :D I'm having the same question as Jin Lim: "Is it possible to add a couple of empty plastic Fred bottles in the order too? I'm willing to pay for the additional costs." Normally you only accept orders from the US. I live in The Netherlands and I would really love to have the clear plastic bottles as well. Are we going to be charged $6 for shipping ??? Hi there, I like many others pulled the color trigger before seeing the other options, could you please update my order from Charcoal to Kickstarter Green? If it can't happen, I'll still be happy! Yeah I am hoping that I can change my colors but if not I will still be happy with getting the products! Hi having seen the kick starter green on a bottle just wondered if I could change the army green on my order to the kick starter green? I tried changing it from the link on my survey confirmation but the link is dead. Cheers Matt When will production start? And is estimated delivery end January? Or earlier? I have the same question than Holger Sube :) Just saw the Kickstarter green Fred which looks awesome . Is there a way to change my order? Congratulations and thanks for a great project! The video was enough hilarity to put me over the top and order a Fred. After seeing the kickstarter green color just now, I would like to change my order, is it possible to do that? will the leather available for us? I dont really care if i need to add some money. the leather sounds great. I just saw your update! Thank you for being on it keeping us informed! Also, extremely pleased with how Kickstarter Green looks! I'm glad I picked it! Am I able to change my mind on colour. I love the green now I've seen it I just send survey with my iPhone app adain, then it work well. I have no idea what's happened, that's because I input same address and characters. I think time heals all error. sorry the comment is mistake here iphone 5s no confarmation mail for delivery no nothing I am hoping mine went through! Also (it maybe in the thread somewhere) but is there an ETA on when this will be delivered? hi, is there a reason that every time I fill out the survey, there is an error? please help! @Kenny Potts unfortunately the survey only offers to choose between the color options but the stainless steel is not offered :( @Adam I just try again, but not working... I only use "-" as a special character to separate my address number and telephone number. I will try again tomorrow with desktop MAC Safari instead of iPhone Kickstarter App. @Sebastian G. On the survey it says you can also choose brushed steel. Not sure if that's is on all of them but it was written on my own that I submitted. This user's account has been deleted. Same here. Tried several times to submit the survey since yesterday and there is a "Something gone wrong" error. Survey not working - I've tried several times over the last couple of days - just returns an error... Just saw that the 'exclusive' kickstarter colors are also available for pre-order. How is that exclusive? Hi, got an error submiting the survey. I did not use any special characters or # etc. im not able to submit the survey too. I have a # , and a + # for my house unit , for , and + for mobile number. Please advice? I pledged for a POWDER COAT COLOR water flask, but now i'd rather get the BRUSHED STEEL edition. Is it still possible to change/increase the pledge to geht the BRUSHED STEEL version? Thanks Is there any way to increase my kick starter order? I would love to get two but I had only pledged for one. @Adam Survey not working... I only input alphabet character, do not use japanese character. I fill all spaces. Number of flask is 1. Please correct the system. Thx! I would love to see a belt type holder. Would be awesome when hiking!! Survey is not working for me. Filled out a few times. Sorry if it's already been asked but are the coloured bottles dishwasher safe? I cannot wait to give this to my wife for Christmas.. well belated christmas I want to see a picture of the kickstarter green and the marsala flasks! I continue to get an error message after several attempts of submitting the survey (using my laptop). @Sina Vodjdani Try using your laptop/desktop instead of your mobile. I had errors using my mobile and it was solved on the laptop. Can't wait for my Fred Water Flask! Rhys Darby and the video rocked big time! I have filled out the pledge form around 4 times, each time a problem arises. Not sure if it went through. Is it possible to a couple of empty plastic Fred bottles in there too? I'm willing to pay for the additional costs Hi, I ordered a brushed steel version, but, with the add-on colors, I much rather change it to Marsala. Is there a way to add the $1 and change the order? So only one of my orders made it in before the time cut out, seriously my receipt says 3:17 any chance I can just up mine to add it onto my initial order? � You guys are awesome great job!!!!Man I'm glad I pledged for 3 with the new colors it will be hard to narrow down can't wait! I'm really torn on what color to get. Yay! Happy days! Yes they will Are they going to ask for my address so they can send it to me in the survey too? @Daniel they are sending out a survey shortly where you can pick color choices. Congrats.....cant wait to see the color choices and get my flask Whoo Hoo. Can't Wait. The basic idea of having a water bottle in a more flat, compact design is one you barely ever see implemented nowadays. I am so glad to see the Fred flask coming to life, and I am excited to get my hands on one! Rock out! Great way to start 2015! Can't wait to fill up and show off my Fred! How do I pick my color of water bottle ?I pledged 30 bucks is that coming later ? Orange is what i,want were do Ieave this info? Woot woot! Congratulations to everyone at Fred Water! I can only imagine how floored you all must be that you made the 200k goal. Happy New Year to all! Congratulations! It looks like old army water bottle(?) used in 70's. I love that aluminum bottle!!! WOOHA! Congratulations guys! Huge stretch reached. Gratz!!! Snuck into an early bird slot at the last minute, and we hit the 200k stretch goal! :) yay! Congratulations and good luck on production! Oh, and happy new year too! =) Whoo! Forgot about this baby! Backed it just in time! : ) Wahoo! Marsala, baby! Well the stretch has been hit!! Hi, I have a doubt, which company are you going to use to send the international pledges? Thank you in advanced I too would love to be able to add some empty plastic flasks to my pledge/order. Even better if they were added as a stretch goal when we hit $200K. I've got some others hopefully chipping in and hoping you guys hit the stretch! Great work on the design and great job responding to comments Adam! I've been trying to choose which 2 colours to get (I'd narrowed it down to 3 but then the two new colours in the last update came along so now it is up to 4. .. curses!) and I was wondering if the stainless steel showed fingerprints/smears at all, like some refrigerator doors do? And if we pledge a bit more, is it a possibility to get some Fred Empty (plastic) bottles included for international backers when pledges are fulfilled? (I'd like to use one of your great designs at the gym and I figure the plastic version is lighter for when I can't move my arms any more...;o) ) Hello! Will there be a photo posted of the flasks in the two newest colors? As opposed to just a picture of the two colors presently listed. I'd like to see what the flasks look like with those colors before I make my final color-decision. Jen. If I get a brushed steel flask can my second cap be a different color instead of having 2 brushed steel caps? I love Fred water and I have been drinking it for some time now, sadly it is only carried at one store in Minnesota, I was just wondering if there is any plans to get it stocked in any other stores. Thanks, Brendan Love the design, great job to all the team, and yes that video is badass! :) Hands down one of the best crowdfunding videos of all time. Nice work! Managed to make my pledge before it ends, a problem though: my billing address will be different from my delivery address (because of relocation), will I be asked the delivery address or it will be sent to the billing address automatically/by default? Just changed my pledge to 3 Fred Flasks my only question or issue is I want them all to be shipped to me. The option was to have them all shipped somewhere different but I found myself wanting several colors to go along with the brushed look. Im sure this won't be an issue just wanted to put it out there that I'm greedy:) nevermind, I already see my answer i pledged a while ago but just missed the stainless version. is there a way to get the stainless version? Im forced to pay for the coated version. If I change to the 4 or 5 pack to from the 2 pack, all shipped to one address, will I get my bottles later than if I leave it? Hi, I have a doubt, which company are you going to use to send the international pledges? Thank you in advanced I love the font used for the "F" on the flask! Can you please tell me which font it is? Good luck with that ZenBar 100vs1000 Just snag one of those $19 super early bird powder coated pledge that someone released. Now if only someone with a $18 super early bird brushed steel would release theirs I could get the one I really want - the brush steel. I just pledged to the campaign, but don't see where to ask for what color I want. Hi, I just tried to order some of your very useful 'Fred Empty' bottles from your website but it looks like you only ship them to USA addresses? So you only care about US people "not dying" from lack of warer...?! ;o) Seriously, as an idea, perhaps you could add some extra add-ons for your backers to include some of the Fred Empty bottles as an option, since you are shipping these new flasks to us anyway? Thanks, and I'm loving your fun brand positioning - it's refreshing! [see what I did there...] +1 to Sammy, is it possible to ship the product to Hong Kong direct to save shipment fee? Hi, I would linke 5 flask ship to one adress, should i pledge 4 flask and add 23$ for an extra brushed Steel? Yes, is it possible to ship the product to Hong Kong direct to save shipment fee? Same with Parker here. I also live in Taiwan, so if there's a way to ship the flask directly from China, it can save some fees. @Nathanael Yeah I second that question. Is there a way? will you guys be providing any information regarding the leather sleeves before this project ends in a few days? I've backed for the SUPER EARLY BIRD SPECIAL FRED WATER FLASK (POWDER COAT COLOR). Now I'm thinking about preferring the STAINLESS STEEL version. Is it possible to get that one without changing my pledge? Hi, I just found that your product is manufactured in China. So I'm wondering is it possible to deliver it from China to my place, Taiwan? This can save shipping fee. Thanks! Less than 5 days left, pledge amount far exceeding initial goal and many mentions of additions to the campaign (stretch goals?), any news, updates for the final push? This is your first KS project. What is your experience with producing in China? I have backed some 50, of which 12 were China based production. Of these, most all were delayed, of which half severely (more than 3 month, some up to a year). Most due to unacceptable quality issues (material, mechanical or color). I urge you to have an experienced 3rd party quality inspector for process and output. Also: do tests (also on the quality of the promised coating). Else you might end up doing lost of uncontrolled iterations, causing severe delays and lots of unhappy backers. I have seen enough of those project. How are you going to prevent this from happening to your project, despite good cont(r)acts, promises and (high) expectations? Just my 5c. So if I have ordered two Fred's, and I want colour, I will need to add $2 more dollars to my pledge? When will we find out if the leather sleeve will be available @Creator, when will these ship? Second question: Because the flask is made of metal, it conducts heat easily. Is there some sort of tech involved in preventing heat transfers? I hope I'm clear enough. I really love the simplicity of the design. Just wondering. Any plans to bring full copper/brass to the options? I totally would pay more just to have a copper flask like that. Does it cost 'me' more money to have a coloured one? Cool! But when will it be in my hands? @Creator: Thanks! Yup, I got a response soon after my last post here. I ended up ordering a case of water from your website on Friday (20 pack of the 20 oz.). It arrived today. It's good water. How is the leather sleeve coming along? @jeremy C. not really. Does the colour version cost an extra dollar? @Creator, now that you hit triple your original funding goals, are you anticipating any delays? Will everything be ready to go after funding hits and what kind of production issues are you anticipating? @Creator when you get the powder coating done is it possible to see a video in how this will look? I didn't want to be difficult so I just changed my $19 pledge for 1 to the $49 pledge for 2. Go get that 1 early backer pledge I dropped guys! I would love to see the Kickstarter Green option! Also, will there be actual pictures of the coated bottles like the model shots for the brushed and one charcoal pic? @Creator: Per your response on December 7, I went to FREDWATER.COM, clicked on Contact Us, and left a message asking where I could find Fred Water locally near my city and zip. More than a week went by and no response. I went back and repeated the entire process about 5 minutes ago. I also asked the same question via twitter. Hopefully someone will respond soon. Or maybe you can tell me here. I'm in Pasadena, CA 91105. Thanks. :-) Ok so I jumped on with the early backer powder coat pledge guys. I have a way of backing projects on a whim without consulting the missus. Now that I got the approval! ;) She is actually wanting one now too! Any way I could just add an amount my early backer pledge get a second one for her? If so what amount should I add for the non early backer and shipping? If I just need to bite the bullet and manage my pledge to the 2 flasks pledge it's cool. Just thought I'd ask first. Excellent project, guys btw! Fred water is the best and I currently have 3 larger sized Fred water bottles and one of the smaller ones in my fridge that I use every day at work!!!! I'm so excited for the stainless steel version!!! Is this product dishwasher safe?? Keep on making great water!!! Hi! Sorry if this is a lame question but is this flask good for holding alcohol (as a more chemically active substance that water)? I mean I do realize you promote it as a health-friendly item but I would love to be able to have my favorite bourbon in it. That's the reason I've pledged for two flasks, actually - one for water and one for... something less healthy :) Cheers! +1 for kickstarter green =D I pledged to receive one of the gifts that says I can choose between stainless steal or poweder color coated, and I was wondering how I requested a certain color. Thank you. Love this bottle but now having found out that it is "made in China", am having second thots. Tend to avoid things made there due to poor quality, workmanship. Would have preferred if it were made in the USA. Would love red as an option. Fire engine red? Maybe Marsala? I prefer a stretch goal for a red colour option. If you have more colours I will have to get more of them! Bee-uuu-ti-fuuuulll! @creator Where will the flasks be manufactured ? Are you considering adding the kickstarter green option has a choice of color ? I can't belive there's no red option @Creator, great news. The colours look sweet - will we get to see more photos or, preferably, a video comparison? Also, you mention that they are more durable than the powder coat option but could you give some more reassurance with regards to the likelihood of the paint chipping in the longer term? Have you done any testing? Thanks I bought a couple 20 oz. plastic bottles and found out they don't fit in my back pocket. I haven't tried the 13.5 ounce ones so I'm not sure there's any size difference besides height. I was wondering if these bottles will be smaller in depth and width than the 20 oz.? well done getting rhys darby to do your video.... probably the sole reason i pledged. god damn that guy's funny. 2 things: 1. Would you guys consider something similar to this product in leather? <url>� Rolling my eyes over the gold plating... Thanks! I can't wait to use Fred Water Flask! Check out my kickstarter <url>"F" (I know "F" is for "Fred"). hehe. I would be delighted to have a "A" bottle (for Alex). just a wish. :P I also think a leather case would be awesome! Hit that Hundo mark. A leather case would be awesome. Gratz on reaching 100k. Can't wait to get mine. I've got the two flask pack but it says mix brushed & powder coated ... I've read you guys said if you want brushed make sure your pick states just that... Will I be able to get brushed in my two pack for sure at the end when I get to choose ? Just making sure is all , thanks Does this come with the other Fred stickers besides the silver/chrome ones? Hello! We just backed with the $48 reward. Hooray! Can anyone tell me if there is a difference between powder coat color and colored stainless steel? From what I understood, the only colored option is a powder coat one... <url>"We will go into production on the first batch the moment we hit our funding goal of $50,000." Does this mean you guys are already in production? @kenny potts i see thank you. @BaSiLB the bottle isn't a vacuum flask. It's a single walled container. It will keep it cold but not as long as a double walled container. Seriously, does anyone know where I can buy Fred Water near Los Angeles? I'd buy from their website, but the shipping kills the deal. Any grocery store sell Fred? I don't want to have to check into a Kimpton again, but I will if I can't find Fred anywhere else. I love this idea! I am getting one for me and one for my wife for Christmas! Are there going to be any stretch goals? If not I'm still excited to get one! Hi, I'm curious is there any stretch goal and rewards? dose it keep the water cold ?! and if it dose for how long ? Love the idea of a leather sheath/case for a stretch goal. I would def up my pledge to get a brushed steel with the leather!! Can't wait to receive my flask! Never heard of Fred Water but love the design. Will be great in back pack! If it possible to get a plain stainless when I pledged for a powder coated? Is the black powder coated flask that Chris Joslin is holding going to be apart of the colors we can choose from? +1 Giving CPR to bunnies. I stayed at a Kimpton Hotel in Los Angeles this past summer (with gf + 2 dogs). They had Fred Water in the room. My gf really liked the bottles (33.8 oz. size), so we brought both bottles home. The bottles are perfect for refilling and drinking. Anyway, I'm so glad I found this project. @Creators: Do you sell Fred Water locally? Whole Foods? Trader Joes? Vons? Ralphs? Kimpton Hotels?? @sam. I asked about backing for the powder coated one and was told to guarantee I get the stainless to pledge for the stainless. I backed the extra buck for the powder coat color, but will I still have the option just to get the plain brushed one if I so desire? I haven't decided yet. :P Thanks for the great campaign and I'm looking forward to receiving my flask! I've needed one of these for a long time... +1 for the leather sleeve Agreed on the leather sleeve. +1 I would like to see some pics of the colored flasks !!! Thanks Like I have already read here, having an accompanying sleeve, made of either a leather type material or a synthetic with the brand name on would be perfect. Is there any opportunity to customize these? Yippee just signed up for 2. My camelbak is leaking and this will be a welcome change. @kenny @ Joshua Leather sleeve would be the perfect touch ... And I bet that would be added to every flask for sure Still waiting on those pictures of the powder coat colors. To add, I agree with the earlier comments that a leather sleeve would be AWESOME Would you be able to include some more pictures of just the flask (with some measurements if you can)? Thanks! I ordered one with the powder coating but it didn't let me chose the color. Any way I can still do that? Will this really be available in January? How big will the mouth be? Will ice cubes fit in easily? Idea for a stretch goal: a sports cap? It would be totally cool to one in brush stainless brown...... It's a GO fellas! @Kenny, I think I was thinking of this Creator FRED WATER 6 days ago Yes, it is safe to use hot water but note that the bottle will get hot. It is not insulated. Which isn't quite the same thing, but same difference I would say. @Chris I for one would love leather. It would look so good. And if leather wasn't an option rubber would be better than nothing I agree a leather sleeve option would be perfect!!! 9 Hundo more left to raise then they can drop the hammer fellas! All these comments & all I remember is, "In terms of a KS green, not out of the question." That... would be amazing!! any chance of seeing a photo of the mouth of the bottle without the lid on. I 'd really like to see what I'm going to be drinking out of to see if it looks comfortable - i.e. not sharp edges. Thanks Also @creator/Adam what about just getting a plain steel flask if I pledged for a powder coated super early bird. Not a fan of coatings. @Nixolous I didn't see anywhere where it states that. Not important but just saying. I'm not wanting hot liquids but a metal bottle against the body will warm quickly I think a leather sleeve would be an awesome add on that I would pay for. Just pledged. What a great looking flask guys, and I'm even looking forward to seeing it after years all battered up and dented and full of stories!! Great job, and good luck! Kenny, They've stated its not a vacuum flask, just a steel flask, So I wouldn't try to pour hot coffee into it. Just wondering. Is the flask double walled vacuum sealed? Also if I pledged for a powder coated super early bird am I able to get a plain stainless one instead? Amazing product, hilarious video. Will the water remain cold in the flask? Cheers. +1 for Kickstater green ! I love watching the numbers rise. So fun to see a great product so close to it's goal. I wonder what would happen if we all posted the link to our FB page for a day? Join me and let's see how long it takes for the Fred team to hit $50k. Great gift idea. I can't wait to get my hands on Fred. another question! i'm currently backing at the 19 dollar level for one flask. i really want two, but the two flask level would cost me 48 dollars. would i be able to double my 19 dollar pledge and get two? or is the only way to get 2 to pledge at that level? thanks again! How leak prove is the flask. I mean, can I rely on it when it's in the same backpack as my MacBook and phone? i love the project, fred water, and rhys darby! quick question though.. will the metal flask make my water taste metallic? could you please post a photo of a close-up of the top of the bottle without the lid on. I'd like to see what the rim looks like. Thanks Looks sweet, think it would look awesome if you could heat tint some of the brushed steel ones as an other colour option. you got my $20 just because of that video.... well, and this thing should fit more vodka than my current "water" flask.... well played sir.... well played. It's worth a dollar to me JUST to tell you your video is awesome. I'm very likely to pledge a bit more if you decide to do a one-time limited KS green. I don't need one ... but my resistance is weakening. I would like to see all the colors in the pictires just as you have with the charcoal so we can get a good idea of how it looks Proud to support you guys even though you abandoned us for sunny CA. Can't wait for my new orange flask boxed set! Since this project is getting so much attention so fast, do you think you guys will be adding stretch goals down the road? Always happy to back an old friend. Good luck- great product! -Jess Reider Thanks for making 2 flask available internationally, but I just went ahead and raised my order to 4 on an impulse. I drink a fair amount of my water carbonated (5lb Cylinder with regulator under the sink for carbonating my own tap water). Will the Fred Flask cap seal hold the pressure of carbonated water once transfered from the vessel in which it was cabonated. I have a 750ml S'well bottle which holds said pressure just fine... but it's a bit big to be jogging to and from work with. Thanks Perfect! Got a bit confused when backing Oh man... Kickstarter Green would be rad... Hi there Fred! I was not able to select a color whilst checking out...do you know a solution to this? Glad to see you are thriving and quenching thirst! Besides the powder coat, is there any difference at all between the two choices? Aren't the powder coated ones just brushed steel that is coated? Or is there something structurally/materially different? I just watched the video (fantastic!) and am excited to be a backer. One question, would it be possible to, sometime before the survery's go out at the end of the pledge period, to post some pictures of the flask in the different colors? That would be immensely helpful in picking a color. Also, any thoughts to about adding a "Kickstarter Green" version? That always seems to help projects when there is a limited edition color (though, for the record, the kit was a great selling point for me). Thanks! Hi, hard to imagine the color one looks like powder coated. Is there any sample of it? As I was thinking of getting brushed steel or coated ones. Thank you. Awesome! Thanks for being so responsive to your backers' feedback. No way for an international backer to pledge for 2 bottles? Very strange way of organizing the pledges by allowing only the option of 1 and 4 for international backers. Hi, I think this is a great idea, and keen to get a steel flask, but I also would like two. What's the reasoning behind the "1 and 4 are setup for International, 2 and 8 are domestic only" idea? Also, if you're open to suggestions, have you considered a lid tether? a small chain (that is fixed on the lid in a way that enables it to spin freely, either a rotating fixing on the lid, or a rotating collar on the neck.) similar to the Aluminium US army Water flasks from WWII. When the lid comes off it hangs from the bottle and doesn't get lost, or need to be held lest it fall in the dirt. Thanks for the answer, Adam! One more thing though, how much does it weigh compare to those original clear version? I have only learnt of the bottles from this project. Are the originals plastic? I'm also pretty interested in them. :) I'd be interested in the sleeves. Is it possible to make it a stretch goal (so the flask and sleeve can arrive together to save on shipping)? Or when eventually available, would you be able to give it to your backers at a discounted price? Thank you. The sleeves would be awesome! Love to see a clear plastic version too! Like eva solo but your shape! Nice idea hope this goes through !!! Hi creator, Since it isn't insulated, does this mean that there will be condensation and drops of water around the flask when carrying cold water in hot/warmer areas? Cuz that might not be very handy when we put the flask in the pocket and get wet. Thanks, Hi creater! Can I use Fred Water Flask for coffee and tea without sugar? Hot water is acceptable? I do have similar queries as Chad Moore (1 stainless steel and 1 powder coat for international; can you create another pledge level for that?). If not, like what P.H. suggested, I would also like to ask for stainless steel even though I have pledged for powder coat. Hi. Can we see pics of the powder coat in the different colours? :) @creator Is the cap threaded with silicon or just completely metal (prefered) to prevent leakage? @creator, can I get the stainless steel version if I pledge at the $19 level? Will that be an option? Thanks How do I pledge to get one Stainless steel and one powder coated bottle? Could I pledge for multiple Flasks and how? Also would it be possible to purchase some Fred Water Bottles during or at the end of this campaign at a discount price? Thank you. I have been buying Fred water for nearly 8 years. Started when living in nyc and needing a good compact design. Continued when I got way to excited to see you guys in a store in Denver. Currently I carry your 32 oz and when people ask about my water bottle I say "meet Fred he is an Aquarius..." Good luck guys I hope you meet your goal I wanted a hover board but since Tony Hawk bought them all, I will just have to settle for a flask. I've been wondering when a decent flattish steel water bottle would come out. More packable in tight bags.
