CYRUS WARD: Edge of Darknessis amurder mysterythriller, with a touch of noir and sci-fi rolled in. This adult theme graphic novel, takes the reader down a dark road and doesn't let them go until the last frame. Cyrus Ward is a down and out homicide detective, who after being forced to retire, is called back years later to help investigate serial killer who is copying a notorious serial killer from his past. Reluctantly Cyrus returns only to discover, that this killer is taunting him and playing a game of cat and mouse. The deeper down the rabbit hole he goes, the closer he gets to the truth...a truth that will change him forever. What makes this story different? This is not just a crime story. This is a psychological thriller with a Sci-Fi twist.This story will take you place that you never saw coming. CYRUS WARD: Edge Of Darkness takes place in the not so distant future of 2026. The one time glorious Manhattan has been transformed into someplace dark and seedy. A part of it, is underwater due to the tsunami of 2018, while the rest has become the breeding ground for the underbelly of society. Across the river, in what was once Brooklyn, lives (if we can use that term) a society of robots. It is a total contrast to Manhattan, clean, shiny and filled with the best technology the world has to offer. Although Robot City plays a small role in the story, a few of its inhabitants do leave a major impact on the life of Cyrus Ward. And who is Cyrus Ward? Cyrus, a retired special crimes detective that focused on serial killers, wants nothing to do with his old life...a life that cost him an eye as well as everyone that ever mattered to him. So when the department comes to him for assistance, he is extremely reluctant, until he discovers that case involves a copy cat serial killer who seems to know everything about him as well as the that of the original killer (whom Cyrus had killed years earlier). With the help of a female detective and a watcher robot from his past, Cyrus will discover a dark truth that will force him to face his own demons. CYRUS WARD: Edge of Darkness The story will be told in 2 beautiful illustrated parts (part 1 and Part 2). Each part will be roughly 50 to 60 pages and in FULL COLOR.

That Comic Guy - 2/20/2013 In a few months the world will be introduced to Cyrus Ward, a detective in the not-so-distant future, who is on a mission to capture a copy-cat serial killer who is mimicking his most notorious case. Creator Maurice W had this to say about the project. "I have always been a fan of noir-ish detective novels, as well as murder mystery thrillers, Sci-fi, and of course comic books. I had just come off what will be a somewhat high profile film project and was finding myself really wanting to write what I love. Cyrus Ward was born out of that." He continued to mention that as he was writing the Graphic novel, he had pitched the concept to several film companies as well. "Being that I write scripts, I approached this as if it was going to be a film and graphic novel type of project, Kind of like how Mark Miller did with Kick-Ass and his other properties. Several studios have shown interest, some more than others. I guess we will have to see what happens once the Graphic Novel is released, but The interest is there."

Maurice Christopher Rising bk 1 is done and going out. the others are almost completed as well.. Just be patient all books will be shipped... We will be releasing some more artwork soon!!! it's coming!!!!!!!!! Like you I can't wait to see the whole thing completed. I just wanted to inform everyone that book one of Cyrus Ward is Shipping fisrt week in february. Most rewards will be shipped shortly there after Maurice We are trying to raise extra funds at <url>#!covers/c1aci There are 8 hours left and just a little more than $500 needed. We can do it! <url>"come hell or high water" M I have no problem responding here. First let me say that I appreciate your comments and truly understand. Shady practices...trust me If i was trying to collect money and never produce i wouldn't be answering you here. I would be gone like the woman in the patrick swayze song."like the wind" That said, I can go on and on about the challenges, but I won't. All I can say is that I have been battling and struggling to get these projects done. regardless of artist issues, I take responsibility for these books and will with my last breath get these books out. Those that bare with me, will be rewarded...I will know longer give you a date or a time frame until I am 100% sure, however I will guarantee that before February is over some rewards will be mailed. This is all I am going to say on the topic for now. Maurice Books and rewards will be gin shipping in January. There will be many extras for those that had to wait. I apologize for delays Vincent sent you my number..call me we are on track we have started mailing out rewards and will be doing so over the next 2 months. thank you for bearing with us. I gave it a chance and it went through. we are only really $2000 away form complete funding to finish everything. I put it on Indiegogo but the odds of getting any traction is slim in comparison..figured if i put that number if i received 2 to 5 percent of it, then we would be good. I underestimated the cost..its a learning curve. But we are still close to supply most of rewards and will begin shipping in December...i prefer to do all shipping in the first week of December. I am 100 percent sure i will get it on kickstarter..indiegogo was always a shot in the dark...at the end of the day...i just want to get the books to everyone... I have the budgets worked out this time around. Hey Matt, just in case you didn't read, we will be sending out books abd rewards starting the first week in December. as for the other thing, we really underestimated what we needed. we cant run second Kickstarter, so we are using the other guy. We are doing all we can to get these books and rewards out. Sorry for the silence for the last two weeks. I was training for a marathon. Which I did. 13.1 miles in 2 hours and 23 minutes. That said. There will be an update later today. M and I thank you so much. we are working hard to get it to you thank you. I am stoked to bring you guys these books A big studio saw the project and are showing interest. Another company is as well. I will tell more as i learn more. THANK YOU, thank you, thank you. I can't wait to finish these books and begin sending them out to you and the rest of those that have supported us. There will be extras from us to show our gratitude. we are humbled. Maurice It is because of people like you that we have made our goal. The support from everyone has been amazing I can't thank you enough. i agree. It just needs to pick up some. I am doing press. I need to get the word out to more people..pull in more people. Getting media coverage is not easy. Yes. Me too. Have to keep it going. I am teaming up with legendary artist neal adam's son for some thing special. Stay tuned That is what we are shooting for. $30,000 would be perfect. lets get the word out. yeah we have a great start....I want to keep the momentum going Per usual, thanks for the information. :) Your comment reminded me that way back in April this year someone reached out to me for info about Woodson on Facebook messenger. She had a claim to file against him as well and said she'd been in contact with someone from California and Canada who also had fraud-related charges (either could've been a fellow backer). I do hope he gets some well-deserved comeuppance. OnChannel I mean Someone just sued him regarding another fraud and won. She used info from this KS to do it. Apparently he has a network called the OnNetwork I'm pretty sure Maurice has slunk under a rock for the time being since he hasn't logged in here since 2017 (which is funny considering before that It hadn't been since 2015 I believe). Also, don't think I have a backerkit email unfortunately. Can't seem to find my BackerKit email and I need to update my address. Anyone got a link handy? Also, has everyone given up on this? <url>"Maurice Screenwriter" facebook profile. *like a More than likely he scurried into the shadows like cockroach when you turn on the kitchen light. No sign of the thief. Website domain is up for sale. No comments on No One Told Me I Could Be President since 24 December 2013. Also, no activity on Cyrus Ward: A Sexy Sci-fi thriller since 22 August of last year. I have to agree with Andrew Dill. We spread the word, keep an eye out, but move on. I just feel bad for those who backed at the higher levels. Maurice! I see that you logged in on October 1st, I want to re-emphasize how much of a lying piece of crap you are and let you know that I haven't forgotten about you. it's looking pretty bleak No refunds and no books. @Nian: Nothing so far. His last login was for 23 July. The last update said that refunds had been mailed out, but no one has posted anything about having received either a refund or any product. Hey guys, just wondering what the status is for your graphic novel? Any update? I have no doubt that Maurice will be back on here sometime down the road, obviously with an alias and with some other "story" to sell. From what I have seen of Mr. Woodson's history, He's had a few issue sin the past where he has conned, lied, cheated and stolen from people. My feeling is that the best way to strike back is make sure people know about what he is done and ensure anyone who searches out information on him knows for sure that he is both a liar and a thief. We may have fallen into his little trap here, but I'll do what I can to make sure no one else does. And from what I've seen, Maurice will be pitching a scheme somewhere else and defrauding people out of their money if he can. I came back here just for fun to see what new updates there were (from other backers of course, it is ludicrous to think Maurice would actually post something at this point). I am just glad I only lost out on $30 because of this. It does kind of suck that Kickstarter does not do much to help fraud victims like what has happened here, but they do provide a warning saying they do not verify projects or their creators. Unfortunately the date from our submitted payments is so long ago it is no longer available to dispute with our banks/credit cards, which would literally be the only way to get any money back after something like this happens. Kickstarter does not have any money to refund us, besides their service fee. A class action law suit makes no sense for $3600 in losses (after you take out Maurice's fake $500 backing). So my apologies to everyone else, but thus is life. Time to move on. I have backed many projects and this is the only one that turned out like this. Maurice was last online July 23rd and he's left no update and no feedback about anything. It seems this thief and coward won't step forward and do what's right address us backers and correct his issues. Anyone from the other Kickstarter projects should also feel free to join the Facebook group. More strength in greater numbers Hey, I just noticed that Maurice logged in to Kickstarter on July 7th. Maurice, I hope you've read everything and I want to reiterate once again that you are a liar and a thief. Benjamin; if you have info; post it in the fb group. Vincent you as well! I found this project with like six minutes left and it was almost 150 dollars short...so i backed without research...but at the same another mysterious backer added 150...yes i think it was Mo who was worried it wouldn't fund......Thats what i get for rushing to help...i would really feel bad if it funded right on target...but Mo made sure it would fund anyway...What an ass! He did it under the name Maurice Henderson, look at the list of backers, last name in the list, 1 project backed THIS ONE and account opened in April 2013 just in time to back this project..how lucky!! Yeah, I'm taking this info to KS. One other thing I want to point out...anyone wondering WHY we have a $500 contributor who isn't shredding this message board looking for his products or refund? Because Maurice is that $500 bidder...think about it, look at the site I linked (under the daily data tab), massive influx of cash right at the end of the project, this project was $1500 down with 2 days to go and it cleared goal? Because Maurice dumped some cash in under an assumed identity (something he seems to enjoy doing). Wouldn't you contribute $500 to your own project if you KNEW you'd get that $500 back plus an additional $3500 (minus 5% of course). If I popped $500 into this project and it turned out like this, I'd be at his doorstep collecting my books or collecting my refund, yet we have heard nothing from a $500 investor. And if we can prove he crowd funded his own project to get it funded, that's fraud (and a breach of KickStarter's own rules). We need a lawyer to subpoena the payment records for this project though. <url>#chart-daily Ummm I have his home address :) I work for a mass media mailing house. I ran it through the national change of address registry and everything. It's current.....any takers wanna go visit him at home at say....2am?! It appears the other KS has noticed us. Welcome folks! <url>"Maurice Woodson ripoff reports" I received this from NY Comic Con FYI. Thanks for the note. You are looking at a floor plan from last year. We will not be allowing that exhibitor back in the show based on some other reasons. We appreciate you reaching out. I think with the comments posted here was can constitute fraud was the intent from the moment this project was setup (regardless of projects before or after it, this project was fraudulent from minute one). With that said, fraudulent intent plus theft over $1000 constitutes a felony in the state of NY and if I go to my local police dept in MD and file a charge, felony theft occurs at $500. Can you have a civil matter and be a felony? I think felonies have to be attended to by state's attorneys, if there's a charge? And then the State's attorney decides whether they can prosecute it? Please go to NYCC Maurice, I beg you, your fans have something very important to give you. Mo wont go to the convention. He now knows his scam has been exposed..on to the next scam. It will be interesting to see what Maurice intends to do to those backers who attend the convention. @Matt Give him a great big hello for me at the con. Harper, thanks for posting what Kickstarter told you, it is pretty much exactly, line for line, what I was told when I reported something to them some time ago (not sure if it was Maurice or something else to be honest and I can't seem to find my correspondence with them). I was sure that they would spout the same line of bull crap to anyone who reported this Kickstarter about trying to communicate with Maurice and "being aware" of him in the future if he attempted to do it again. Which is amusing considering that all Maurice apparently has to do is make another email account under a false name and he'll circumvent Kickstarter's "thorough" security system. I fully expect Maurice to appear on Kickstarter sometime down the road or on another crowd funding website in an attempt to screw over more people whenever his money supply starts running low. Kickstarter could do one or two basic things to protect people on this site and prevent people like Maurice from having an easy time at getting money. 1. Kickstarter should actually look into the Kickstarters that they publish. Yes, it would take a bit of time and effort on Kickstarter's part, but it would have caught Maurice's lie with the 2nd kickstarter with relative ease. Instead of walking away with just over 4 grand, Maurice instead walked off with almost 9 after the 2nd kickstarter. Most of the stuff I posted about Maurice was literally tracked down in a single sitting and with minimal effort. 2. Allow people to message each other privately. I shouldn't have to back a project in order to communicate with people, I would gladly have messaged anyone who backed the 2nd Cyrus Ward KS to let them know about this one and therefore save them the headache/money/etc. I genuinely think that the reason Kickstarter hasn't implemented this feature is that they know people will communicate and that could hurt some Kickstarters and therefore, their bottom line. As was pointed out, Kickstarter gets 5% of every single project that meets it's goals. Maurice's frauds he's committed? Kickstarter got 5% each and every one. At this point the only real options for dealing with Maurice are as follows 1) Getting the word out about Maurice - Maurice Woodson should be banned from any kind of crowd funding site again. Any attempt to raise money anywhere should be met with laughter and derision from the community at large. The best way to stop Maurice from doing this again, is by prevention. 2) Legal action - More than likely Civil Action, while I don't know the laws in New York (where Maurice is from) I'm betting that contacting Police up there would be met with a, "This is a civil matter, not a criminal one" so more than likely it would come down to filing a civil lawsuit against Maurice and having a court order that he pay up to all the backers of all his projects. Now obviously there could be costs associated with this, but it gives me a hell of an idea for a kickstarter... The "Sue Maurice Woodson Kickstarter" As I said in my earlier rant, I do very much plan to be at New York Comic Con this fall. As of right now Maurice has a table booked for "Blaque Sun Publishing" the fact that he posted pictures from there last year tells me that he does indeed show up at this event. More than likely he'll be trying to get more money from people for selling Christopher Rising and I wouldn't be surprised if he was taking "Pre-orders" for Cyrus Ward and the other books while at the Con. I plan to be there and confront him face to face. Sorry for any redundency in my posts, which i see there is. I'm kind of typing blind here on a tablet with my finger, can only see a few lines of what i type at a time. I heard back from kickstarter. Matt, you were right they couldn't care less. Vincent, you were correct also, they are accomplices with no consequenes it appears. After i wrote the 1st time, stating what i pointed out in my post from 5 days ago, i got basically a form letter back stating what i already knew in their faq.. that they are not liable for anything and some plans don't fulfill as planned etc. I was tempted to just give up there i knew a while back i was out $80, which isn't the end of the world (... but hey, it isn't 'chop' liver either... i sure hope somebody catches that and chuckles.. some levity is needed...) so i did respond saying i know my money was stolen but they didn't address: - the fact that it was sneak thievery from the onset and what consequences does Maurice face for having 2 kickstarters under 2 different names? Can he scam others on this site, buyer beware? -what kind of consequences and reprocussions does Blaque Sun and Maurice face? Here's the answer i received, copied and pasted.. be interested in someone elses interpretation: Hi Thomas, I'm happy to reach out to this creator and ask that they communicate better with their backers about what's going on with their project, but we're not able to facilitate fulfillment of refunds or rewards. I've also made a note in our system about your message, and we'll take this into consideration should the creator submit another project in the future. Best, Megan Thanks again to all who kept the discussion going. @James Moss: Much agreed. I've also had most positive experiences on Kickstarter as well. By and large, the creators are willing to take responsibility for delays, shortcomings and what have you work with the backers to engender good will. Queso6p4 - the one bad experience is not a problem for me. I've had many good experiences on Kickstarter. My very first project fell through, but the people running it were responsible individuals who kept everyone up to date, gave a refund and treated the backers well. Maurice Woodson's problem is that even if given the benefit of the doubt, he had no plan, no follow through and left backers with no answers despite being asked for them. I could have turned the other cheek and let him have further opportunity to do so but decided not to let him. I refuse to let him victimize anyone else here. This message is for Rob "Egon" Lamerton from the other Cyrus ward project or anyone else who wished to discuss it further - search me out on Facebook to trade info if you like. @James Moss and Matt Reppert: Thank you both for keeping this dialogue going, but your comments further emphasize the two main huge drawbacks of projects like this: cheating creators (Zachary and quite possibly Yuriy) as well as discouraging backers from taking a chance on a project as the potential risk of backing an unvetted creator can outweigh benefit to the backer. It's a shame as such actions undertaken here and presumably on the other related projects completely undermine the attractiveness of Kickstarters in general. As Matt said, I'm also more cautious now, especially of comic projects as those are almost all I back, but will jump on board with creators who've delivered. Quite a few have done so recently and are going on to subsequent projects (Unsounded, The Will of Captain Crown, Recipes for the Dead, Artbook Collection, etc.). There are even projects where the creator has yet to deliver but does maintain contact and is generally accessible, and while this is undesirable I understand that stuff happens-just be honest with us on your progress and keep us in the loop. Own your project and most backers will be pretty darn forgiving and be willing to work with you. Honestly there is no "its not looking good" anymore. It ISN'T good because Maurice essentially ran off with everyone's money. Based off of what Zachary Brunner (who is whom I spoke with with I wrote my earlier "rant") has said, Maurice obviously conned the artists out of their time and effort. Now, I don't know the time frame when Maurice commissioned Cyrus Ward, Christopher Rising, Executive Order and No One Told Me I Could be President, but given the fact that the No One Told Me kickstarter began in 2012 it's obvious Maurice has probably been doing his scams since mid 2012 or so and given the other complaints that go back to the mid 2000s or so, it's plainly obvious that Maurice has been lying to people for years and he is pretty much immune to feeling any sympathy towards anyone whom he bilks out of their money. As for Kickstarter, reporting this is a start, but honestly, they aren't going to do anything. They aren't going to reimburse anyone for their money and in terms of legal liability it would probably be very difficult to wrangle anything out of them. Kickstarter never promises anything from anything that you back, one way I could see them being legally liable would be if they KNEW what Maurice's intentions were when he started his Kickstarters and that would be pretty difficult to prove. The only way I could see that happening would be the fact that Kickstarter approved Maurice's second Cyrus Ward Kickstarter despite the first one (this one) already having been successful. It does bother me TREMENDOUSLY that Maurice was able to create another user name, create a Kickstarter using the title of something that was already in existence and absolutely NO ONE at Kickstarter caught on to this. I've seen some creator projects taking days or weeks to be "approved" by Kickstarter and one would think that Kickstarter was doing even the most basic of searches on it's own site to ensure the protection of backers. But I guess not. Kickstarter over time will see a hit in it's business because people will bow out due to horror stories like Maurice here. It's a shame really because there are more good people than bad ones out there. At this point in my "Kickstarter Life Cycle" I only back projects that are very, VERY interesting or projects whose creators I've backed before. It's a far cry from 2013 when I backed TONS of projects around this place because I loved the creative vision that this place seemed to be nurturing, however, much like any other business. The company's callous disregard to it's own consumer base will hurt it if not kill it outright. PLease find below the last message posted by Rob "Egon" Lamerton on the second Cyrus Ward Kickstarter project: Just following up on my previous comment. As Mr. Maurice Woodson is ignoring my messages to him (and, by the looks of if, messages being sent to him by others, too), I decided to contact the artists involved with the project – Yuriy Fialko, the artist for Cyrus Ward, and Zachary Brunner, the artist for Christopher Rising – and ask them if they knew how the project was progressing. I haven’t received a reply from Yuriy yet, but Zachary has given me permission to post his response here on Kickstarter. (Incidentally, if James Moss, Matt Reppert, or anyone else who backed the previous Cyrus Ward Kickstarter happens to be reading this, you might want to copy and paste this next bit into your comments section so that as many people as possible can read it, although I don’t think it’s actually going to tell you guys anything you don’t already know at this point). “Honestly your guess is as good as mine. He never paid me for the work I provided for him (an entire book) and he hasn't returned my emails for almost a year. On top of that, he stole artwork unrelated to Christopher Rising from my website and is selling it on his online store.” Then, when I asked for a few more details, he followed up with this: “Just last week I found out that he had stolen the artwork and was selling it on his site. I was in full communication with him until I sent him the final artwork (for the book). He paid me 10% up front, so I had no reason to believe he wouldn't pay the rest later. However, once he got the pages, he had a different excuse every time as to why I hadn't gotten paid. He said he sent the check several different times, and when it never arrived, he told me it must have gotten lost in the mail. Every time. He even went to comic con with the book and sold copies of it.” It doesn’t look good, does it? I also reported the project, letting them know about the email exchange i had with Yuriy Fialko and asking them to let me know where i could forward the email. I'm sure, like many of you, that it will do little good but I pointed out a few things to them: -That Maurice started this and a second kickstarter after his first unsuccessful attempt at funding with no new artwork and no contact with the artist, so this isn't a project that fell through... it had to be fraud from the start... <url>’d set out to do. You never did. Blaque Sun Publishing also hasn’t updated it’s Facebook since October of 2013 which further gives evidence that you never intended to deliver on what you promised. No pictures of anything being worked on, not even a “we’re excited for what we’re doing here at Blaque Sun!” Hell, your image that you’ve used for your profile of Blaque Sun is ripped from a wallpaper that I found with a simple Google Image Search. Not to mention that you are apparently selling posters of artwork that is literally being sold on the website of the artist who came up with it. For example, on page 3 of your “store” you have a print called “Shotgun Valentine” for sale. <url>#!store/c1p5g But the funny thing is, I found it posted on DeviantArt back in 20-freaking-11. Meaning that the artist posted it online around 2 YEARS before you stole it, cropped it and put it on your site. Furthermore, I was able to get in touch with one of the artists you said was doing the art for one of the graphic novels and here is what he said about you. “Actually, we did have a business agreement and I did illustrate an entire graphic novel with him. However, when it came time to pay me, he disappeared and stopped responding to my emails and phone calls. Even after we signed a contract discussing payments and rights, he did this.” Is anyone here not convinced that you are a liar and a thief? But a little digging about you Maurice revealed some interesting things, like how you were “CEO” of Nomad Entertainment, AO Records, and god knows what else. How do I know this? Why, the complaints board of course! <url>“Maurice Woodson owes for a years rent. He said his accountant was sending it, then his account stole $75, 000 from him, then his father was ill, then his father died, then a movie company was to send his payment directly to me, etc. He has no integrity, don't rent to him. left the apartment filthy, window blinds in shreds from peeping out to see who rang his doorbell...” Man, constant excuses about where your rent was, going on for months at a time that sure sounds familiar doesn’t it? Another complaint mentions how you were given $10,000 to launch your books but took the money and ran. Yet ANOTHER talks about how you stole $250 from him and a script copyright and you actually RESPONDED to him. Here is your response. “I Won't even dignify this idiot with a response. Get a life. I walked away from project as per my right because you are disrespectful and I believe racist. Damien Calmeson of Flushing. Your idea of vacation gone wrong wasn't a good one. I had to change it completely to make it work and sent you a signed document stating that i forfeit any claim on your insipid story when I decided to walk away. See you in court for slander and defamation of character...clown. Your $320 yo will never see. It is payment for my headache, stress, and time. This is the last I will say on topic” Payment for your headache, stress and time? Accusations of racism? Are you actually serious? I’m guessing that’s what you’re doing here as well. Myself and the others hassling you are probably causing you so much “undue” stress and you probably feel as though you “deserve” the money. I wonder if you think those of us calling you out are being “racist.” People (myself included) have been saying things like, “It really is my fault for not researching this more before backing,” and you know what? It’s not any backer’s fault. Anytime I back a Kickstarter project I shouldn’t have to do a thorough background check of the person making it. Maurice is a con man, plain and simple. As has been said by other people he peddled Cyrus Ward around in an attempt to hook as many people as possible in order to get as much money as possible, suffice it to say I will be contacting any website that has a preview of Cyrus Ward or any other work he has “done” and will be demanding that they take it down, I will post them links to this and the other Kickstarters as well as the previous links I have posted. I’m also going to ask those sites to publicly post something detailing what Maurice did and to warn anyone who has any contact with him in any business sense to beware. While Maurice obviously is a con man the entire world needs to be alerted to this fact. I encourage everyone else involved in this or any Kickstarter Maurice has started do the same, if need be I will provide links to “articles” about Maurice’s Kickstarters. Anyone else who wishes to add anything they’ve discovered on Maurice, feel free to do so. I am mentally and physically exhausted from writing this whole thing out. There is a TON more stuff I could delve into about you Maurice, but I won’t for the time being. I will say this, if you are at New York Comic Con this October, you had best pray to god that I am unable to attend because I will sit by your booth for an entire day and tell every single person that dares walk up to you that you are a fraud and you will steal their money. In closing Maurice, I want to emphasize this once more. You are a liar, you are a thief, and to quote South Park, you are the biggest **** in the universe. - Fin Time’s up Maurice, you’ve failed to meet another deadline for the last time and it’s time to drop the hammer, no one has posted about receiving anything and if you had actually mailed something, a refund, a book, anything, it would have arrived by now. This rant is broken into several parts but I will post them all for people's education, I've copied it from a word document so any spacing errors are a result of my missing them in the copy and past process. Okay everyone, this is going to be an extremely long, extremely detailed post. If you sit down and read the whole thing, you might get angry, or you might just be apathetic at this point about this Kickstarter. Maurice, if you are reading this whole thing, I don’t expect to hear from you again after this post. First of all, let’s get something out of the way, Maurice is indeed a thief and he is indeed a liar. He lied right out the gate to everyone, I and others have done extensive search and have found no reference to a Maurice Woodson being a writer for Law & Order anywhere on the net. Hell, your name doesn’t even come up on a search on IMDB for anything. For someone who boasts as you do about how “involved” you are in the TV/Movie business, I find it amusing that there is apparently no record of you ever actually doing anything with said businesses. In fact, the only things I’ve tied you to actually writing are this book. <url>’ll get to later. Also, you claim to be an editor which is absolutely laughable because your spelling and grammar is horrendous. I don’t think you’ve posted a single thing that hasn’t contained multiple spelling and grammar errors. If you’re an editor at any magazine/newspaper/whatever you probably weren’t one for very long and from what I’ve gathered you’re terrible at editing because what I’ve seen you write is an insult to the English language. <url>#v=onepage&q=Child%20Abduction%3A%20How%20to%20Protect%20Your%20Children&f=false That is a link to your Child Abduction book; it is riddled with spelling and grammar errors. What’s amusing is that every single review on Amazon that gave it 5 stars was not a verified purchase. But don’t take my word for it, here is a LINE from the book for people’s reading pleasure. “If you can obtain a recording device, connect it to your phone. (In case abductors contact you). Ask your local law enforcement if they have device.” Wow. A-ma-zing. But I don’t want people think I’m being an ass to you just to point out your total lack of writing or editing skills Maurice, oh no, I’m being an ass to you because you are a THIEF AND A LIAR. But how do we come to this conclusion? Oh, what a journey Maurice, but let’s go on it together shall we? First of all this Kickstarter was funded in April of 2013, so over a year ago as of right now. Since the Kickstarter began you were lying to us. You never had any intention of delivering a single thing that you promised to us. The only reason you responded to us is because some of us decided to stand up to you and what you were doing. I notice that your other Kickstarters don’t have the same outcry (yet) you haven’t posted any updates or even commented on things in months. In the case of No One Told Me I Could Be President, which was funded in November of 2012, you have not uttered a single thing to those people since December of last year. Furthermore, you decided to start up ANOTHER Kickstarter for Cyrus Ward despite the already successful nature of this one. You did this under a pseudonym to get past Kickstarter’s rules because you KNEW that they would shut it down if they found out. Thus, the Cyrus Ward Kickstarter run by “Blaque Sun” came out and was funded in November of 2013. So far in either Kickstarter you have posted next to nothing about any sort of progress being made about ANY of the books. Not even “No One Told Me I Could Be President” which, need I remind you, was funded in 20-freaking-12. Instead what you posted were excuses, I will not repost them because there are too goddamned many of them. Numerous times you set dates that everything would be shipped…and broke them. You made promise after promise and never lived up to any of it. I have gotten numerous and I mean NUMEROUS books, comics, graphic novels, even video games in the time since I backed Cyrus Ward. But I digress, back to the whole you’re a liar and a thief thing. You’ve also created Cyrus Ward pages on other crowd funding sites including Indiegogo <url>#!products/c1u3q That is just what I’ve been able to find with a basic search, I have little doubt that you’ve gone elsewhere panhandling for cash. However, where we really start to delve into the whole “Liar and Thief” territory is Lies in Blood. <url>’s this? A link to amazon? Huh, wonder what it is…why, it’s Lies in Blood by Maurice Woodson! <url>’re going to try and argue that “But it was for a physical copy!” you might say that Maurice, except for the fact that one of the tiers was GETTING IT FOR A FREAKINGE-READER OF YOUR CHOICE. Seriously, here is the direct quote from your Kickstarter, at the $10 tier. “Our thanks plus a PDF of LIES IN BLOOD the Novel. An ebook of the novel for your reader. Plus a Signed Poster by the Author” What’s also truly amazing is that you are the only person who will ship the novel (which apparently doesn’t exist, except, oh wait, Amazon says it was physically published NINE DAYS before the Kindle version was). I seriously just discovered that information about the physical copy as I wrote that previous paragraph. God, you are a piece of shit Maurice. I notice you never updated your Lies in Blood Kickstarter to tell people that they could already purchase what they were putting money towards the creation of. According to Amazon, Lies in Blood was in existence nearly six months before you created the Kickstarter to fund it. You walked away with $500 of people’s money for something that they, by all accounts could have bought. I wonder how much money you’ve pocketed from your scams at this point. Enough to apparently fund you getting a booth at New York City Comic Con this October and last year as well. <url>’ve responded to us, but ONLY us and I believe the primary reason for that is because we were the squeaky wheel getting the grease. You haven’t commented or updated any other Kickstarter which is further proof that you’re just walking away with people’s money. You obviously care nothing about any people who willingly gave you money for something that looked cool. You are one of the greatest reasons that I’m extremely distrustful of Kickstarter these days. Congrats Maurice you’ve nearly killed my generosity towards people on this site. You may actually respond to me, I doubt it, but if you do, don’t you DARE come with an excuse, another deadline, another promise, or another whine about the difficulty of the project. I know, you know and hell, most of the backers on here know that you probably never intend to deliver on a single thing you’ve promised. Not the PDFs, not the Posters, not the books, and certainly not the refunds. It’s funny because I have backed a project where the creators came out recently and said, “We’re broke guys and we’re sorry, we can’t deliver on what we promised,” you know what the reaction was Maurice? Suggestions. Acceptance. Support. No major angry posts like this one. - Continued in Part 2 Tick tock Maurice, though I don't know why I'm saying that, you haven't even logged in here since May 28th as I write this. I supported this project because I thought it was a great story and I believed in helping the little guy get recognised. I have now had that belief completely shattered. It is probably my own fault for not researching this project enough, but now I have I find that this graphic novel has been the basis of many attempt at funding all at low targets. Looking back over this there are some big alarms I should have picked up on, all the reviews on Cyrus Ward and interviews with Maurice W are written by... M. Wood. In the comments (March 20 2013) Maurice admits the target he is shooting for is actually $30,000, if I had seen this I would not have supported. Then in photos he posted of comic conventions he is signing Christopher Rising books for people and worst of all on his website he is selling copies of Cyrus Ward, Christopher Rising and No One Told Me. So he is either holding out on us or ripping a lot of other people off. Maurice I held out and gave you the benefit of doubt but you have done nothing to instill any confidence in me. All your other projects seem to be asking the same questions years on and I have no doubt in my mind now that you are nothing more than a scavenger. If it's not already clear I want a refund and expect an apology. He has 7 days.... I pledged at 150...That was all my extra money after a month of bills. I believed in his project and wanted to help him out. I apologize to the backers right away for not keeping up to my promise to update and checkin weekly. I'm dealing with some of my own personal issues that prevented me from checking in last week. Needless to say, I'm still awaiting for a refund / package / sign of life from Mr. Woodson. As I look to the comments section, I also see that I am not alone. I also see from some of the other project run that they are starting to grumble about lack of items being delivered, lack of updates and in general where is Mr. Woodson himself. I've tried to stay away as much as I can from labeling Maurice a thief to give him the opportunity to be responsible to his commitment and follow through with anything. I have no issues calling him a liar however, since he's lied many times over many different aspects of these campaigns. I want to point out that at any time Maurice could have stepped up and become a great project manager and worked with the artists, the backers and made this into a big success. He didn't. In fact he's antagonized people around himself so much, he's caused himself more problems an more pain then anyone else. I can not see Blaque Sun being a successful company with the reputation that he has left in so far. Me. Woodson has said things will be delivered within the next two weeks (I say, there's a better chance of us all being hit by meteors) but he has given himself and stated that deadline. I still urge people to report here if they end up with anything coming from Maurice. It'll be a good indication of fulfillment of anything if they do and less heat for Maurice. I doubt anything will be posted though. I also urge others to start digging into Mr. Woodson'A background. There are many indications of shady business practices and very little in supportive information of Blaque Sun being a viable business entity. I challenge anyone to show me a piece of news/website/interview/anything that shows this company exists outside of Kickstarter. I've seen a few interviews when the Kickstarter a were running but nothing afterwards. The big question from this update now is not only where the items are but just in general, where is Blaque Sun? I feel bad for the poor SOB who backed for $500. LOLOL 1st comment in 3 weeks is to correct me typing the incorrect month. Not to give any updates or anything. So good. June 28th and no refund. Just glad I only backed for $30. I feel bad for the people that committed hundreds to this project and got scammed. Nothing yet...June 17th fast approaching. Still nothing here. Anyone receive anything? Hey Maurice your the biggest piece of shit !!I don't think you have in honest bone in your body !! hope you are able to sleep @ night , and by the way if your ever in my neck of the woods stop by so I can punch you in your lying face !!!! ( That would by refund enough for me ) I lost patience 6+ months ago and 10 lies ago. You've lied about book deliveries, you've lied about sending a refunds. No one here has received a thing, there's no proof you are working on anything. We are a almost a year after the initial completion date, you tell us nothing and offer no plans. You insult us further by saying you are too busy to update us after taking our money. And now you request another extension to follow through on your fourth? no... fifth? promise to deliver on something. Where are these so-called refunds you promised months ago? Tell me in your own words, at what point do the backers who supported you stop being nice and call you a thief? How much time has to elapse? Maurice, what does "about to be rewarded" mean? Are we getting the posters? The books? PDFs? What? I notice you haven't provided pictures of anything completed or even boxes about to be shipped out. You'll have to forgive me if I don't trust a single thing you say right now about anything. Another week. No package and no one stepping forward to say they have received anything. Maurice Woodson seems to no longer be responding and others are starting to question in his other campaigns. He has continually lied about this project and at this point it's safe to say stolen the money from the people who backed him. @Vincent White: Partially to blame? I'd ague that it's become a clearinghouse for fraud. Looks like the state of washington filed the first consumer protection lawsuit againt a kickstarter...Looks like the fines will be rather costly if they win...stay tuned...Accountability is coming! Still no refund here...nor any product. Kickstarter is partly to blame as they have no accountability system in place. They need to change that and get more proactive in protecting what is ultimately their customer base. Here is another project Mr. Woodson has run on Kickstarter. Same person. Different account and people kept waiting for there product. At this point it's a pattern of abuse by Maurice. <url>"No One Told Me I Could Be President" and you haven't updated that since November of 2013. The other Cyrus Ward Kickstarter that you ran after this one you haven't updated since February. Another week and still nothing has been delivered. Nothing has been communicated to be delivered and again, no one has mentioned receiving anything here. It's now almost been nearly 6 weeks since it was last communicated that refunds have been sent out to 10 people. No one has stepped froward to say they have received anything. Where are the refunds? Where are the books? Where is the digital books? Where is there any progress on any of these books even being recorded right now? What is the plan? What is the launch date? These questions persist and not one good answer is supplied. Maurice, You wanted to step up and be the kind of man your mother would be proud of, so follow through with your words. tell us your plan, tell us your sad and sorry, but more importantly follow through with at least something. Still nothing..but i did get a personal email after my last post saying my refund has not been sent out yet. Just a note: nothing received here. Again, very disappointing. This project had promise, unfortunately Mr MoWood has seen fit to disgrace himself and his work. Sadly, it doesn't matter how good the books are, the level of artwork, at the end of the day, all you ever have is your word. It would seem, in this regard, Mr MoWood is morally and ethically bankrupt. According to Mr. Woodson, 10 refunds were sent on April 2 (See update # 40), so far I've seen no postings to suggest anyone has received any of these along with the books. At least one of these refunds should have arrived at someone's doorstep if in fact these were truly sent out. There's been no PDF links, no refunds no artwork and no books. There's still no visible plan and updates have been reduced to broken promises on the refunds themselves. There has been no more mention of work or information on the books that this project was intended to be about. Mr. Woodson has been given more than ample opportunity to come clean and make good on any of the various promises he's made in the past. I've opened the floor and encouraged anyone who can acknowledge delivery of good or receipt of refunds to step forward, prove me wrong and that we all have not been duped. No one has stepped froward. No one has received anything. We are now at the 60+ day mark of when Mr. Woodson quoted a 90-120 day turn around time for refunds. It was unacceptable then and unacceptable now. "PDF of Christopher Rising will be sent over the email..Monday the latest and the physical of the first of the books will be mailed on Monday." In case you were wondering, Monday (from when you wrote that) was the 7th. It is now the 12th and I checked my email and no PDF or link to a PDF is in my mailbox. Not to mention nothing has arrived in the mail. The mail I could let slide (despite the fact that I live literally an hour and a half drive from New York City meaning that any mail you had sent from there would have arrived at my door sometime in the middle of this week). Hell, I ordered things from California that came through regular mail in about that time. But what I CAN NOT let slide is how you said that a PDF was going to be emailed out to everyone and obviously, it wasn't. "For those still waiting, when I have a definite ship date I will let you know. I refuse to give another date and be wrong." So much for sticking with that promise. Another week and nothing has been delivered here. Has anyone received any package from this project yet? If anyone does receive something, I still urge you to let us know here. Still nothing here. I am a days postage away so i definately didnt make the mailing list. Again another week and checking in again. Still no package and no refunds. Mr. Woodson, should these be starting to show about now? If there was a delay, shouldn't you have shown up with another excuse as to the delay and be telling us why nothing has been sent again? Why does it seem that I and a few others here are having to almost take over and run the show? I told you months ago that we would not be going away. "Refunds will begin beginning in two or so weeks and will continue thru the month...Christopher Rising will me mailed without further delay the end of next week. More details to come." I'm still waiting with baited breath Maurice. I notice we are now into April with nary a refund or a book in anyone's mailbox. Sadly, nothing received here either. Couldn't be more disappointed. Nothing here yet either. Again checking in with no updates, no packages and nothing to report. Just checking in. Nothing to report. No packages or refunds for me and it looks like no one else received anything either. I still urge others to post if they do receive anything so that we are all informed. I would also like to helpfully point out that Christopher Rising has not arrived in my mailbox despite you saying it would ship around the end of February. It is now the second week of March. Now, you're saying the end of next week? Seriously, this is getting comical. If anyone receives either a refund or shipment of rewards, please post on here. In the interest of everyone here and moving forward I am dedicating myself to update once a week on here with my own status on the situation. If for any reason my messages stop, please take it that actions were taken to prevent me from doing this. Mr. Woodson, I would seriously consider finding someway to show to your backers some progress with the rewards and/or the refunds. I again state that we are not going away and more than deserve respect and attention. We are now 3 weeks in from the time that several members have started to demand refunds. With your lack of comment on that, I expect that they should be in the mail by now. I have not received mine yet. I am done waiting as well, mainly because there is not even a time frame given. It now being March 2014, we are almost to the 1 year point since the project was successfully funded, and 8 months past the July 2013 estimated delivery. I love kickstarter, its community, its artists, and the opportunities it gives people ... but this is just abuse at this point by the creator. We should not even have to ask for refunds, if you were a decent individual you would return all funding as no commitments have been delivered upon. Cyrus Ward looked really cool, I wish you well on its completion, but this was a fiasco to involve 66 people, collect their money, and have no legitimate plans to complete things. I expect a refund in a timely manner, not 3 months from now. It's not just how you word things Maurice, It's how you treat people... your backers and supporters. You refuse to give information. You can't be bothered to check the details on the people who have trusted you and backed you. You leave investors with no definable plan of action or delivery date. You have stated items are in the mail. Just look below on November 20th. "we are on track we have started mailing out rewards" This is a bold faced lie. No one had received anything and by all means, please have someone come forward and prove me wrong. If you were working on a project for a business you would be fired for mismanaging it and trying to cover it up. This project had meaning to us too. We invested in your initial dream that you presented to us, which included timelines and a plan. All that is left now, is a vague promise of items will be delivered ... well frankly, who knows when. There is no plan, no dates and no commitment given. You stated you were worried about your reputation but your actions counter that. Since it's none of our business what difficulties you have and we don't need to know any of the details of your problems or how the project is going, we really don't need to know how frustrating it is for you either. If you can't give us anything to help us understand, I don't see how we can supply you with the sympathy you are looking for now. Add me to the list of the refunds. You have the information already from the survey. I also don't expect to wait 90-120 days. I think we've all put that time in as extra on this project already. And as much as you state you aren't running away, none of us are either. We are tied to each other until this is resolved one way or another. Okay, this is going to be a very, VERY long and angry response to Maurice here, so if you don't want to feel the fury, stop reading. Maurice, Okay, I'm going to point out how many things are wrong with what you posted, I'm going to do this calmly and logically. I'm going to do this, comment by comment of what you just posted. Post One: "Look. Dont think I dont understand...I do completely. I expected to have this book finished months ago. I have to deal with all the issue and I am dealing with them. all books will be done and sent.. if I didn't want to deliver books I would not be responding at all. that said, If you want a refund, send me your information and you will be refunded within 90 -120 days. If you are willing to wait, then allow me to do what I need so that you may recieve what was promised to you..its your call. send refund information to <email> ( I don't have time to go searching for the information)" First of all, no, you don't understand. You've been giving false information about the project for months now. Delays happen, I understand that, hell, anyone who is reasonable that has backed multiple projects on this site understand that. However, what you've done is blatantly lie about each and every ship date. Furthermore, you've provided next to no evidence that anything is even being worked on. The closest thing I can think of is some "preliminary sketches" you showed us in May of last year of Christopher Rising you've shown nothing of Cyrus Ward, No One Told Me and Executive Order. Furthermore, people shouldn't HAVE to send you their information for a refund, you sent out surveys nearly a year ago, remember? Also, you refer to "this book" and not "these books" which tells me all sorts of bad things about the project, not to mention that you tell people to "send refund information" to your email address but in no way state just what in the hell constitutes "refund information." What is refund information Maurice? My name? my address? my social security number? my paypal account? Furthermore, you "don't have time to go searching for the information"? Seriously? That is condescending as hell towards backers of this project that might want refunds. So what exactly are you doing about shipping stuff? Do we have to resubmit our info since you obviously can't be bothered to look it up. There are only sixty-six backers to this project, it's not like you have to sort through thousands of backers to figure out people's info. Finally, 90-120 days? Are you FREAKING KIDDING ME? The most amount of time I've ever had to get any refund from any person/site is two weeks maximum. Basically you're saying that people potentially wouldn't get a refund until potentially JUNE, are you actually serious? Post two: "Posters and Christopher rising book 1 will go out the end of next week....I was waiting to send everything together, but Book 1 of Christopher rising has been finished since October and I should have Just sent that out. Cyrus Exectutive order and No One Told Me are all on a delayed schedule. I am not going into the details because they are irrelevant. all that matters is that for those willing to wait for some great books, they will all get done and delivered...for those that want refunds..it doesn't matter anyway." Maurice, First of all, details are relevant to BACKERS OF A PROJECT. The head of a company doesn't tell investors, "Well, things aren't going as planned...but the details aren't important and frankly irrelevant," people would RIOT. As I've stated you've posted next to NOTHING to tell us that any of the other books are being worked on. How about this for a clear message Maurice, people aren't asking politely anymore for details, they are DEMANDING them. Also, I would like to know what in the hell you meant by this, "for those that want refunds..it doesn't matter anyway." What doesn't matter? The people that want refunds? The ability to give those refunds? Are you saying that you're incapable of doing refunds? Or unwilling to? Post Three: "For those still waiting, when I have a definite ship date I will let you know. I refuse to give another date and be wrong." No definite ship dates except for your previous post when you said, "Posters and Christopher rising book 1 will go out the end of next week" So good, now that we've gotten a "definite" ship date of February 28th for Christopher Rising, I look forward to it being in my mailbox within the first week of March. I'll close this out by saying no one should give you their personal information for a refund. I will be god DAMNED if I give you any information related to any form of digital payment or personal information. I still want the books but honestly, I'm doubting that you'll ever deliver. Yes, you're keeping in touch but that is hardly any hard evidence that you're not walking away with people's money. From this project and the other one you posted for Cyrus Ward, not to mention the OTHER kickstarter for No One Told Me, you've gotten nearly $10,000, with Kickstarter's cut you've probably walked away with just over eight grand. I suppose I should point out how the project for No One Told Me actually finished in November of 2012 and from what I've read NO ONE has gotten their books from that. I, for one, have to agree with these other backers. I know that delays happen and I have no idea what it's like to fulfill a Kickstarter project. That being said, I and backers in general, are very forgiving of delays, setbacks, and what have you. We ask that there be transparency with the project. Almost every comic project that I've back has suffered delays, but as long as the creators are up front with the process I don't mind. I must agree that not only having funded another project separately (I Could Be President), then again in a bundled project (this one), as well as a separate Cyrus Ward project (Cyrus Ward: A Sexy Sci-fi Thriller by Blaque Sun), does come off as shady. To be fair, Blaque Sun does seem more like a collaborative project more like this one. To top it off, I went to your website, where apparently at least one volume of Cyrus Ward is available for order through PayPal. If it is possible to put in an order, this comes off as both underhanded and insulting. Please just keep us in the loop with what's going on. If anyone has received anything please let us know. <url>#!cyrus-ward-edge-of-darkness/c5g0 I think the biggest issue can be summed up easily as after being 6 months late and everyone being continually lied to and the target date pushed back and back, we currently are at a state where this project has no plan, no commitment and no end in sight. And to tell us we don't understand what is going on and how hard it is when the responsibility lies directly with the person running the project is unforgivable. It's time to start offering refunds. You obviously can not deliver on your promises and offer no concrete business plan to move forward. By the terms and conditions of Kickstarter you are obligated to return funds to the people who pledged to you when you cannot deliver what is promised. @Matt Reppert No one told me I could be President was backed and stuff 2 years ago. <url>"Christopher Rising book 1 is done" When was that posted? October 4th. Since then nothing. No ship date. No further artwork. Hell, I honestly can't remember the last time that "No One Told Me I Could Be President" or "Executive Order" have even been mentioned in any update, THAT is how long it's been. "Also wanted to mention that thank cards went out today and some posters and artwork will go out around the end of next week and the following week." - May 2013 "Christopher rising will be completed by the end of august. It will begin being shipped in september and will be available at NY comic con." - July 2013 "The books and rewards will start shipping In December." - November 2013 "We will start shipping fulfilling all rewards starting the end of December" - November 2013 "I just wanted to inform everyone that book one of Cyrus Ward is Shipping fisrt (sic) week in february." - January 2014 These are some snippets of updates you've posted. By all accounts Christopher Rising was done last year but yet nothing has shipped. You said Cyrus Ward was shipping the first week of February but now, here we are, going into the second week since you made that proclamation and nothing has arrived. Also, I should point out that the posters, which you said were going out in bloody MAY of last year never arrived to a single person. Hell, we haven't even gotten links to the PDFs of the completed book (by the way, if Christopher Rising book 1 is completed where is our link to the PDF?). I suppose backing this was my stupid fault, I really should have looked closer at what you were offering and hell, how you typed it up. The following is verbatim part of what my reward tier was. "PDF as well as special edition Hard Cover versions of all titles (send a note indicating which titles)" Why would I need to send you a note designating which titles I wanted in hardcover if, by the tier's own description, I get ALL of them? As James Moss posted a few days ago, there was grumbling by myself and others when I posted that link to your other Kickstarter which was to gather more money for Cyrus Ward. However, I and others overlooked the fact that you were pretty clearly breaking the rules of the site. People underestimating the costs of actually producing and shipping something on Kickstarter are one of the primary reasons for them failing/being delayed/etc. Backers here I would argue have pretty consistently showed their support, however I think we're approaching the point when SOMETHING has to start coming out of this. PDFs of the books, the posters, hell, ANYTHING. Most of the things I've backed by people around the same time as this project have shipped and I've received them. Hell, have people who backed your other Cyrus Ward project at the $10 level gotten their thank you cards even? Everyone understands that things happen but if you don't tell us we can't understand whats going on. You are 100% right that we would not understand the challenges, complications and problems involved if not told about them. The reputation you speak of is already diminished by your own actions taken already. You managed to raise funds through your ideas and commitments made. You ran into trouble which happens and the rules were bent, Despite minor grumblings, I think as a collective whole. we turned the other cheek and gave you the benefit of the doubt. But now, after more missed dates, poor communication and neither a plan or a commitment shared with the people who helped put your project in the water. When you create a second Kickstarter selling the same goods as this project but under a second identity, I would call that a shady practice and the concerns were raised at that time. As someone trying to preserve the reputation of their new company, fracturing off projects under different IDs ensures that it's harder for backers to fully understand what is going on. And I will agree it is very much your job to deliver what was promised. My question back to you would be that after multiple promises of delivery (even going so far as to say some of the items are in the mail) at what point do we say, this is broken and it's not going to work? It is not unreasonable for any backer at this point to be angry, disappointed and expecting some answers Hi Maurice, I think people have been more than fair and generous in giving you time to finish the books you have promised. Shady practices such as running the same Kickstarter again under different user names does not promote confidence in the project. One in which the production time to complete is nearly doubled the original estimate. Out of 4 products offered, we have none that have been delivered. As much as you would like me to address this with you one on one, the good folks here who supported you deserve the answers to this as much as I do. I think we've hit the end of the line of good will here. Please provide a complete and proper status update, the people here deserve to know the complete plan on what is going on and when to expect the items promised. As much as you hint at and elude to issues with the artists which delay the book, I sincerely doubt that 4 separate artists all having the same issues with you to deliver the product means that the actual issue is with the artists themselves. You have several completed Kickstarter projects, Indiegogo projects and your own website set up to generate sales for these books. You've had double the estimated time you yourself asked for to generate these books and deliver upon what was promised. Your updates are basically a string of last minute surprise extensions on when to expect delivery. You contradict yourself on numerous occasions stating you started mailing rewards Nov 20th below) and yet no one, not one person, has come forth and said they have received anything. It's time to step forward and address the situation. I'm also the same username on gmail if that's more prefered or anyone else for that matter @James my facebook is facebook.com/trollboy hit me up. If Cyrus Ward was to be published this week and it's completed, done and gone to sent to the printers, then why in the updates released today does it say a few pages still needed to be completed? And even if a few pages were needed to complete, there should be something to show us. Why is it, none of the artists working on your books are connected to your Facebook page? @Matt Wiseman: That's good news. Thanks again. From my latest emails with him: Cyrus Ward is going to be finished this week, sent to the printers and shipped. Hopefully PDF's to follow. @Matt Wiseman: Thanks for that info. @Matt Reppert: I hope the info Matt W provided helps. I am hoping that we get some kind of update on shipping soon. @Queso I mailed him directly a couple days after posting. I got this response: hey Matt yes I am posting on friday...been away working on a film......I saw the order thank you. Cyrus Ward Book 1 is due to ship Feb 2nd. Chris Rising goes out a week earlier. @Matt: No recent updates to speak of. We only have the creator's comment from last month. It's been a couple months since the last update, anything new on this? Has anybody received there book yet !! I'm getting to the point where I want a refund is that a opinion ???? I mailed you direct via a KS a couple times. Did you get my msg about the new address and the correct book? When is my book going to ship ?? Thank you!!! As long as everything gets delivered I will be happy, I still haven't heard back on how to get the commissioned art level i backed at :( With your second Kickstarter running under a different name and it now being November with a promised delivery of last July. Rewards seem to be different but increased in your new campaign. Anyone who purchases your Cyrus Ward book at the same dollar level I did seems to get 2 issues (not specified what type ) compared to the one hardcover I pledged for. Promises of further items for stretch goals in your new campaign are leaving an extremely sour taste in my mouth. You also said that Kickstarter won't let you do another funding but there is this <url>
