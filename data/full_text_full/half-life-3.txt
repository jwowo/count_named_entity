I have a small team of 6 people including myself, we all have our own funds in order to keep ourselves paid for the duration of the project, the main ask for pledges is literally just to keep up to date with the latest software and maintenance in a project such as this. We are looking to create a full playable game of half-life 3 as we feel the game needs a continuation which we loved playing so much and as valve seem set on not re-creating a half life 3 then we are looking to steal the market for this ourselves. No we haven't approached Valve about this, this will be released under a different name and concept but it will in-fact just be half-life 3, we are naming it half life 3 at present just so fans know what we are actually doing rather than coming up with a new name game from the start that people are more likely to pass by not knowing what it actually is. As this has just been brought up the '10month' timescale is not a delusion on our part. This is when we hope to deliver an alpha test for our backers in order for them to see our progress and have something back from the project. This will include some general movement and interaction play as well as previews for later graphics.
