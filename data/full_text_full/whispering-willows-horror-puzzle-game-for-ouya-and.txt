Follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube! Go to our official website. Whispering Willows is a horror puzzle game that features a dark and rich narrative, beautiful 2-D visuals, and haunting melodies that will leave you yearning for more. The game will release for OUYA, PC, Linux, and Mac (and if stretch goals are hit, later to Android and iOS). The emotional story will unfold over five riveting chapters, each more intriguing than the last. The story will immerse you in a rich history steeped in the depths of the human soul as you solve the mysteries of wayward spirits. You will assume the role of a young girl named Elena as she searches for her missing father, against challenging odds, working through unconventional puzzles and bypassing other-worldly obstacles. She must harness the powers of her heritage, utilizing astral projection and other ethereal abilities to find her father before he, too becomes lost to the hopeless morass of the Willows estate. Our goal at Night Light Interactive is to create innovative, exciting, and memorable experiences. Being gamers ourselves, we're always trying to innovate and create something totally new and unique, while retaining the best elements of the old. The ultimate payoff is to see the reaction of someone who experiences a game we have created. When we initially started Whispering Willows, that was and remains our goal. Control Elena in the Physical and Spirit Realms Utilize Elena's supernatural ability to make an astral projection of her spirit and enter the realm of the dead. You'll solve puzzles by switching between her two forms and using them to your advantage. Fly through the air, squeeze through cracks no mortal could fit through, manipulate time to your will, freeze objects and harness the power of light to ward off evil spirits in the mansion. Help Spirits Move on to the Afterlife The wayward spirits you interact with are all hopelessly chained to this existence. Help them to peaceful absolution and save them from their violent fates. Each ghost has their own story to tell, and helping them may just help you to overcome obstacles of your own. Solve the Mysteries of Willows Mansion As you assist Elena in finding her Father, the many disturbing secrets of Willows Mansion will unravel, revealing to you a past that is so horrifying and yet so human that you'll be left not knowing what to think. The lies, deceit and inhuman violence will all bubble to the surface when you play Whispering Willows. Art from the game can be found in the Art Book. Pledge at the appropriate reward tier to get an exclusive Kickstarter copy! To thank you for your support, we have brought together some very talented people to work on the rewards.

When you will get your rewards: May 23rd (or sooner)- PC/Mac/Linux - we are working with the Humble Store right now to update all versions of the DRM-free game. This will include Chapters 1-3. May 27th - OUYA - We will update the Humble Store with the OUYA codes. This will include Chapters 1-3. Unfortunately, this version has to be alongside the OUYA release, and not earlier.

Words can't really describe the excitement that just rumbled through the team. We just wanted to thank our fans and our incredibly supportive community. This would not have been possible without you. Expect awesome things in the future and were super excited to share this game with you! Hello everyone, it's been a while since I gave you a meaty update about the game. As an indie game studio it is hard to predict release dates, and I hate giving premature estimations on delivery and scope. I'd like you all to know that the game development is going incredibly well. We've had a great year so far and I'm sure you've seen that we got 1st place at the Seattle Indie Gaming Competition. We are going to the Game Developers Conference next week and showcasing WW at the OUYA booth. We are also incredibly close on Steam and anticipate we will be greenlit by the end of this month. There are two scenarios getting discussed right now- one is releasing chapters one at a time, and the other is releasing the game once all chapters are complete. We hope to have the game wrapped up in the next month at which point we will make a pre-launch build for backers to play while we put the final touches on everything. I will give you an official release date once the game is complete and ready to launch, which as of now I predict would be a May release. Thanks again for all your support, this game wouldn't be possible without you! GDC is right around around the corner! We’re very excited to be able to show everyone the game in San Francisco and hope to meet some of the community that’s supported us thus far! To celebrate the excitement in the coming week, here’s an art piece by Night Light’s freakishly talented concept artist, Amanda Kiefer!

We just submitted Whispering Willows to the IGF! Best of luck to all the applicants, we’re honored to be submitting our game alongside so many talented and passionate game devs! Speaking of talented and passionate game devs, check out and support our friend Oded and his awesome Reggae Adventure game on Kickstarter, Bolt Riley Hey everyone, We just recently released a new Whispering Willows gameplay trailer and were really excited to share it with you! Chapter 2 beta is right around the corner and it will be coming to exclusive backers first ($50+)!!! Stay tuned, more updates to come!! I'd like to send a shout out of support to Matt Gilgenbach and his Neverending Nightmares Kickstarter . The project needs an additional $15k in the next 27 hours to get funded. Not only will they get the $99k if they are funded, but OUYA will match it because it is a Free the Games contestant (and the best looking game I've seen on there.) It is a psychological horror game coming to OUYA, PC, Mac, and Linux. It is inspired by his battle with obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression. The art direction is fantastic and the mood is incredibly creepy. I actually had the pleasure of listening to Matt speak at GDC this year, and he seems incredibly talented and dedicated. I am backing this project and I highly encourage anyone who is a fan of horror to check out his game. Good luck Matt, Night Light supports you! I wanted to give an update on our estimated release schedule for Whispering Willows. We are moving at a pretty good pace now, and if we keep it up, we will be able to release a chapter every month and a half. Some of you were worried when I announced that we would be OUYA exclusive for 6 months upon release, but we will be able to still work on and sell PC, Mac, and Linux versions of the game alongside OUYA. The exclusivity only applies to consoles and mobile. As for translations, we will be starting the process this week for Chapter 1! After we feel each chapter is polished we will send to translators. Translations will not be implemented until 4-6 weeks after the full game is completed. Again, this is estimated and subject to change. Since we are all volunteering to produce this game, it's harder to predict events that set us off course. Mid Oct- Ch.2 Beta Early Dec- Ch.3 Beta Mid Jan- Ch.4 Beta Mid Jan- Release Ch.1 on OUYA and PC Mid Feb- Ch.5 Beta Late Feb- Game Finished Early April- Translations added And a special treat for our fans and supporters...The Whispering Willows opening cinematic: <url>’s website, and through their media channels.

And if that didn't get you excited, The book will also include finalized game art, storyboards, and more. All this brought to you by the the Night Light Interactive Art Team. Hello, A lot of you have been asking about Whispering Willows and when the first chapter will be released. As of now we are hoping to have a soft launch of Chapter 1 for PC, Mac, and Linux on September 1st for Kickstarter and early backers only. We would like to get as much playtesting and feedback as we can before we launch on the OUYA and other web stores for PC, Mac, and Linux. We are also considering waiting until Chapter 2 is ready before we release the first chapter to the public. We are hoping to release all chapters 2-5 by the end of 2013. Last week we released a new demo to our 1337 backers! This is an updated version of the catacombs based on feedback from E3 and RTX. Soon we will have the rest of chapter 1 complete and ready to test! If you aren't a 1337 backer, you're still in luck. We made a video that walks you through our new and improved catacombs! Watch the video HERE . You spoke up, and we listened. We are going to try to get the game out in as many languages as possible! Although we can not guarantee all the languages, we are currently working to get translators setup to bring the game to you in English, Spanish, German, Italian, Norwegian, and Polish. We are still looking for someone to translate the game in French and in Japanese. If you know a translator that would love to be credited on the game and help out, please have them contact me directly on Kickstarter or by emailing david [at] nightlightint [dot] com. A few other good tidbits of news- we will be including our official Night Light stickers in every order of physical items from Kickstarter or from our website- <url>’t Know Jack , and Forsaken Planet ! Hey Everyone, I just wanted to update you on the progress of the game and your rewards. Game- I'm sure most of you have already played the demo of the Catacombs (the first part of Chapter 1). If you haven't played it you can check out KS backer Tim Molesworth's video here ! We have a lot of changes we will be making and implementing still- overall to pace out the game mechanics a bit more and give a more clear direction to the player. Of course we will be adding new animation, art, lighting, and writing as well. We are programming most the game's mechanics right now. Shortly after we will be working towards building out more of the actual game and implementing the mechanics we've created. This first chapter is taking us the longest because we need to create all the initial mechanics, UI, etc. The following chapters should go much faster. We have completed almost all the artwork for Chapter 1. We are looking to release the core game (Chapter 1 and 2) by the end of August. We then would release the final Chapters 3-5 over the rest of 2013. Special Thanks on Website- All credits should be on our website here . If you don't see your name, please message me and let us know. QA Backers- You should have received your first demo early and will be getting exclusive demos going forward of any content we create. You can leave feedback in our forums ! Soundtrack- We will send out as many tracks as are finished when we send out the core game in August. The rest of the tracks will be sent as they are finished (for remaining chapters). Digital and Physical Art Book- We will likely get this printed in August and send it out around the time of the core game. We want to wait so that we can get as much art jam packed into it as possible. Due to popular request, as much of the team as I can get will be signing every physical copy! T-Shirt- These are actually finished, but I would like to wait to send them out until the other physical rewards are complete. All four designs have turned out beautifully and if you will be at RTX in July (or future conventions) we can give you your shirt early! Portraits- These are almost all complete and we will send you your digital signed painting in August. Your portrait will be somewhere in the game, but could be anywhere from Chapter 1-5 (where ever we see fit). Plushies- These will be completed in August and be shipped out with the other physical rewards. Spirit Avatar- We will send you a still image of your finished ghost in August and your animated ghost could be anywhere between Chapters 1-5. Easter Eggs- Still in the process of making/figuring out these. Amulets- These are finished and turned out beautiful. Will be shipped out in August with the other physical rewards. Thanks so much, feel free to ask questions in the comments below or our forum! David The new Whispering Willows E3 Demo is open to the public! Try it out and leave us some feedback on the forums ! The NLI Whispering Willows crew will be at the OUYA Park E3 this year showing off an exclusive new demo of Whispering Willows! There will be many other OUYA developers showing off their games including Soul Fjord , Chronoblade , Towerfall , You Don’t Know Jack and MRS. DAD vs KORV ! Keep an eye out for us and come say hi. We’ll be at the: OUYA Park E3, 601 West Pico Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 90015 Tuesday, June 11th between 1-2 PM Won’t be able to make it out to E3 this year? All Kickstarter backers in the “Shape the Game Tier” ($50) and higher will get exclusive early access during the week of E3. Everyone else will get access to the demo the following week. Thanks again to all our fans and supporters! We have decided Whispering Willows will be divided and released in five chapters, in an episodic fashion. Each chapter focuses on a particular ghosts backstory and key part of Elena’s journey as she ventures deeper into Willows Mansion. So what does this mean for you backers? We will be able to release content much faster this way and you will be able to play each chapter when ready. All backers of $10 or more will receive all five chapters as they are released. The first two chapters of Whispering Willows are right around the corner, following the launch of the OUYA. We are planning on releasing the first chapter for free and offering the chapters two through five for $2.99 each. People will also be able to purchase the complete game for $9.99 (saving a few dollars). Thanks everyone who helped support the Whispering Willows project! As promised for the first tier of rewards we’ve added your name to the website, look for your name here! nightlightinteractive.com/credits Level design starts out as an idea - usually a location and an arc in the storyline. From there it’s back into drawing, lots of erasing and rattling the mind into finding a design that fits. There’s a lot to think about when designing for Whispering Willows. Interestingly enough, just the shape of the level is an important aspect. Square rooms are generally boring and serve as overworlds in most games and aren’t where main gameplay happens. After I’ve sketched out a design for an area, I also write up the “solution” to that area, which is the fastest possible way for the player to beat the level without mistakes or backtracking. After this I immediately build and work with my art team on creating the space in Unity3d. From here it’s mountains of playtesting, tweaking and notes. As the game’s designer I generally play the game more than everyone on our team, as every little bit has to feel just right. I constantly try and think of the game from all perspectives, pretending I’ve never played an area or I have no clue what to do, to get a sense of what players might be thinking at the time. With Whispering Willows we are focused on our visual storytelling and compelling puzzle design, and with all the mechanics going on, there’s almost limitless ways to create our world. Game Designer Evan McAnulty Taking inspiration from centuries of ghost lore and literature from various cultures and the hit show American Horror Story, we were intent on creating a setting for our game that would be truly spine-tingling. There's not much creepier than being alone in an expansive, old mansion that's empty save for spirits of the dead. We tried to combine elements of all our favorite horror games in order to fulfill the overall feeling we wanted for the Willows Mansion. We also took heavy inspiration from Chico, CA's Bidwell Mansion, a place known for its seedy history in which owner John Bidwell massacred and enslaved hordes of Native American peoples. With such a chilling setting for Whispering Willows, we crafted our own history that would rival even Bidwell Mansion's messy past. The history we created is historically accurate and rife with interesting details for players to uncover as they progress through different parts of Willows Mansion and its surrounding grounds. Writer/Narrative Designer Kyle Holmquist The first three languages have been chosen! Whispering Willows will be translated to Spanish, German and French. Japanese was a close runner up. We may translate to more languages in the future but these three are guaranteed. Thanks for voting! Since we reached our stretch goal of $20,000 we are translating Whispering Willows to three different languages. Which languages would you like to see Whispering Willows translated to? Vote Here! The Night Light Interactive Store is having a sale, $5 off on any T-shirt till the end of this weekend! We recently added two new shirt designs to the store, so check them out! Art Q&amp;A Part 1 Part 2 features Amanda Kiefer, our Concept Artist, who worked on ghost concepts, our library of amazing in-game assets, and beautiful painted backgrounds. 6. Do you approach in-game art any differently than you would a promotional piece? If yes, how so? Amanda : I do approach in-game artwork much differently from promotional work. With in-game assets, I am focusing on the way the asset will look in the setting as well as keeping the style consistent with the other assets that other artists and I have created. Creating in-game assets is more of a technical and detail-oriented process; I'm not trying to create anything new or evoke emotion, I'm trying to make the mansion look put-together and fit the style we are going for. I paint promotional pieces with a goal of evoking emotion and getting people worked up and excited about the project, and I do this with the lighting, composition, and overall mood of the piece. 7. Are you a fan of horror films and games? What sort of ideas did you pull from your experiences with these mediums? Amanda : I am a huge fan of both horror films and games, my favorite horror games are Lone Survivor and Amnesia and I always try to draw from the anxious emotions that come from playing those games when painting a creepy piece. I'm a huge fan of horror films as well, but I mostly pulled from horror stories/literature and games for Whispering Willows because I feel like Whispering Willows is not an in-your-face scary game and films usually go more for that kind of scare. The horror stories I used for inspiration for the artwork I have created for Whispering Willows are creepypastas , which are sci-fi and horror stories written by anonymous authors and posted on sites like creepypasta.com . 8. What is your favorite aspect of working on WW? Amanda : I've loved creating the promotional images of Flying Hawk , Le Rue , and Wortham Willows . Breathing life into those characters has been a real treat for me, and the fact that the paintings had to be finished in such a short amount of time gave me the chance to learn how to commit to decisions I was making with my work quickly. Creating art for a horror game in general has been a very fun and exciting experience especially because it is a genre that I am a huge fan of. 9. What sort of media inspired your Wortham Willows piece? Is there a reason it pulled from these? Amanda : The portrait of Wortham Willows was originally inspired by oil paintings of wealthy tycoons that were painted by commission in the late 1800's, and by Wortham's rich backstory. I also looked at a lot of dark/macabre art to get inspiration for the creepy factor that I wanted for the piece. I wanted the portrait to have a haunting look that wasn't too creepy but still slightly off-putting. I chose to paint Wortham because he is an interesting antagonist who is an integral part of the Whispering Willows storyline. The visual design of his character had not been hashed out yet at the time, so I thought this would be a great introduction piece. 10. WW is extremely focused on story and feeling. How do you try to incorporate this into your pieces? Amanda : I try to incorporate this into my promotional and environmental pieces by picking out powerful images from high points within the story of Whispering Willows. For example, I chose to paint an image of Fleur le Rue surrounded by the love notes she wrote to Wortham Willows because she is an interesting character who had to deal with a lot of hardships in her life, from her feelings for Wortham to her unfortunate circumstances with their illegitimate child as well as her death. I wanted whoever looks at the illustration to get the feeling that she was frustrated and heartbroken, so I gave her a look on her face and body language that conveyed those emotions. I painted the love notes flying around her to not only help the composition but to also make it look like maybe her emotional state was affecting the wind in the hallway making the notes fly around.

More often than not when I start a new game, I start with an open paint program of some kind. I sketch out areas, mechanics, and their interactions - I try to capture a simple visual queue of how things should work. From here I flesh out the gameplay and flow. This is in the form of flow charts and storyboards, which eventually act as a guide for myself or Programming as to how the game should play. Flow charts are usually descriptive: "enter room, player can’t proceed, use ghost, find object," etc. These help me figure out how the players will think when they play the game long before I’ve even built a level. After the flow chart, I began working on our game design document. For industry vets these are common-place, they’re huge word documents that are meant to be the framework for the entire game’s gameplay, not necessarily its level design (which is a whole other animal). Once the framework was laid out I started working on level design. Please check out our current demo here, and stay tuned for my last post on the level design! <url>’s creativity and help push the game into a unique art direction. 5. Please describe your role as Concept Lead for Whispering Willows. If you could start the process over again for WW, what would you do differently as Concept Lead? Ayla: My role as Concept Lead has many different aspects. From the beginning, I began the exploration and creation of Elena with concept sketches, leading up to turnarounds, poses, and color examples. I have contributed to the creation of the environment through speed-painting, as well as many in-game assets. As of late, I've been doing promo art for the game itself and Kickstarter. I've also helped with some of the rewards that we having going on for the campaign, as well! That concludes Part 1 of the Q&amp;A with the art team. Please stay tuned for more!

We will have our own booth with a playable demo and be giving away and selling swag! Rooster Teeth is best known for Red vs. Blue and our very own composer Steve Goldshein writes some of the music for the show! I'm also very pleased to announce that Steve Goldshein will be collaborating with the Videri String Quartet , for a special bonus track on the Whispering Willows soundtrack! This track will only be available to those who purchase the soundtrack via preorder on Kickstarter or through iTunes. The Videri String Quartet is an extremely talented group of musicians who have performed at Rooster Teeth's RTX conference in Austin with Jeff Williams' Freelance Orchestra. This exclusive bonus track will feature the Videri String Quartet and Casey Williams performing a suite of chamber arrangements based on all the main character, level and ghost themes from the chilling Whispering Willows original soundtrack. <url>“The entertainment has arrived,” he said with an intoxicating Spanish accent that matched his olive skin. He flourished with a bow and as he raised his head, looked the maid dead in the eye. He held her gaze as a charming smile spread over his joyous face. He winked at the girl and blood rushed to her cheeks. She smiled sheepishly and looked as though she'd faint, but she didn't. She welcomed him inside with a wave of her hand and he happily nodded at the girl as he traipsed past her. The man walked through the mansion until he came upon the grand ballroom. Servants skittered about, attending to the last touches of decoration. “Obliged you could take a night off at the saloon for my function, David,” a gruff voice said to the man's left. David turned to the man that addressed him. “Señor Willows! I would not miss it, sir.” The two men shook hands and went over the evening's schedule. They shook hands again and Wortham walked away as David took a seat at a grand piano of polished ebony. He ran his practiced hands over the ivory keys and played a jaunty tune to warm up. He continued to play as guests appeared and the ballroom filled up. It was truly an exquisite affair – bejeweled women and monocled men danced about the immense space to the showroom tunes David played out on the piano. As the night winded down, David stopped his playing and mingled with the guests. He joined a group of gentlemen as they lounged beneath the veranda. They smoked cigars as they enjoyed glasses of bourbon and spoke of current affairs and politics. David finished his drink and and had another. He finished that and had one more. He continued this until a graveyard of glasses festooned the floor about his feet. He hiccuped and stood from his chair and swayed about for a moment until balance was attained. “Buenas noches, my gentlemanly friends,” David managed to slur as he gave them a sloppy wave and stumbled away. He made his way carefully down the steps to where his carriage waited. He paid little attention to what was in front of him and was shocked to be face-to-face with a large draft horse. Deathly afraid of the equine family, David gave out a shriek which spooked the horse and the others in the area. They snorted and whinnied as they moved about the hitching post. This provoked David's phobia even further and he stumbled wildly, suddenly surrounded by horses. He decided make a run for it and screamed bloody murder as he began to sprint. He ran behind a line of horses and made it near the end when one of the horses kicked suddenly. He stopped right before the horse and narrowly avoided being struck. As he turned to run the other way, the horse he was behind decided at that moment to unleash a devastating kick. The horse's hooves exploded into the side of David's stomach and he was sent flying. His body was found entangled in some bushes the next day. A service was held for the man, but no one was there to play him out. Backers, I can never thank you all enough for helping us make it this far. We reached our goal of $15,000 today at 6:13 AM PST. So what's next? We want to push and try to hit our first stretch goal. If we are able to make it to $20,000, we will be adding translations for three different languages of your choice! You can read all about our stretch goals here . We only need $4500 to hit this goal and it would be fantastic so we can bring the game to as many people as possible. So one final time- I urge you to spread the word to message boards, your family, your friends. You, the backers, have made this a reality. David Logan I want to take this time in our final hour to send a shout out to all of our friends, family, and you the backers! We are a little more than $1000 away from our goal, with two days remaining. If you haven't yet, please share our campaign with anyone who would enjoy it as much as you do. Several other Kickstarter projects have gone the extra mile for us and I wanted to thank them publicly. Days of Dawn by Bumblebee Games Bumblebee Games graciously hosted us in their live Kickstarter show "Alive and Kicking." They've been incredibly kind and supportive to help us make this a reality.

Portrait ($150)- In the portrait tier, YOU the backer provides an image of yourself and a short description of the kind of character you want to be. Don't want to have the portrait be of you? No problem, how about a pet or friend? As long as it fits in our world, it is fine with us. Our talented artists will take your image and make it a portrait in the mansion . You will also get it as a high resolution signed image. Enter Kickstarter backer (and close friend) Dillon. He wanted to be a barber shop singer. He provided us his picture and a reference photo. Our concept artist Amanda Kiefer took a photo of Dillon and created a portrait for our very own mansion! Amanda created a beautiful progress update for us, it shows everything from concept, to basic foundation, to final painting. And finally, just like in the last image, we will be putting it somewhere in the mansion, possibly similarly placed like the ones by the stairs, shown here. Consider it our little "Where's Waldo" Easter Egg for our backers ;) Thank you Amanda, thank you to Dillon for the wonderful portrait pose, and thank you to our current and future backers.

We soon realized light preventing the ghost from moving forward, and conversely the darkness preventing the human player from moving, creates a far more dynamic puzzle design. Thus, we could now limit where either form of the player was allowed to be, creating areas that incorporate the ability to talk to ghosts and the ability to interact independently of one another, which added new layers of complexity to the game, which makes gameplay more engaging. Please check out our current demo here to see the light mechanic in action, and stay tuned for my next post on the design process! Game Designer Evan McAnulty Hello Kickstarter! We have just released a brand new teaser trailer showing off some of the beautiful art and animation the game will feature. We wanted to give you a feel of the overall atmosphere and style of the game. Please comment below and let us know what you think! David Logan We are pleased to reveal our second plushie, Flying Hawk! Flying Hawk is the first ghost Elena will encounter on her journey. Read more about Flying Hawk here . The plushie's staff has velcro so you can remove and reattach it! Just like Elena, each Flying Hawk plushie is custom and hand made, available to anyone who pledges $250 or more. At the $250 tier you get your choice of either Elena or Flying Hawk, and at $500 tiers and more, you will get both custom plushies! Special thanks to Erika for working so hard to create the ultimate Whispering Willows swag! Hello everyone, This is your official invitation to the live-show "Alive and Kicking" this Sunday! "Alive and Kicking" we will feature some of the coolest video-game projects on Kickstarter including "Whispering Willows" and David Logan!

The program and link to the stream can be found on <url>– 3:00PM (Whispering Willows 12:00-12:30 PM) EST (New York) 10:00AM – 6:00PM (Whispering Willows 03:00-03:30 PM) CET (Central Europe) 4:00PM – 11:59PM (Whispering Willows 09:00-09:30 PM) Thanks and see you there, David Logan Flying Hawk is the first ghost Elena encounters on her harrowing journey. Once the powerful shaman of a Native American tribe, Flying Hawk was murdered in cold blood by Wortham Willows and left to roam the beyond. To capture the essence of the character, I used a deep tribal drum pattern surrounded by eerie, misty pads. Flying Hawk's spirit is trapped outside his body, and his experience of the astral realm give him a greater understanding and therefore a deeper fear of his fate. This fear manifests sonically in the glassy, airy pads that wash over the primal drums. These pads are in fact the same drums, spectrally convolved and time stretched beyond recognition to create unnatural, disturbing sounds. The main melody is played on a wooden wind instrument with a very ancient and morose quality that embodies Flying Hawk's strong traditional roots as a shaman. Composer Steve Goldshein What is the truth of evil? Why does it exist? Where does it come from? These are just a few of the questions we considered while conceptualizing our antagonist Wortham Willows. We have in all of us the makings of hero and villain, savior and scoundrel. In tapping into our own deep, dark recesses may we find answers to these questions. From studying psychopaths to common miscreants to ourselves, we believe we've found the formula to what causes people to do bad, and Wortham Willows is himself the very compound of those reasons. Acting in the only way he knew how, Wortham committed some truly horrible acts in his life, but the any act is considered differently depending on what angle it is viewed. With this in mind, players will uncover the nasty secrets behind Wortham's actions, and may discover that our evil antagonist is perhaps more human than he may seem. Writer/Narrative Designer Kyle Holmquist Concept Artist/Illustrator Amanda Kiefer Whispering Willows was announced today as the OUYA Create Game Jam’s winner for the “Most Immersive” award! In total there were 166 games submitted for the game jam. Whispering Willows was also a finalist in “Pop Your Eyes Out” (best visuals) and the “Grand Prize.” We are incredibly honored and congratulate all the other finalists and contestants. Today we entered Whispering Willows in Steam's Greenlight program. Steam is one of the largest platforms to digitally distribute PC, Mac, and Linux games. They have a strong emphasis on indie games and if your game gets enough positive response from the Greenlight program, then they will place your game on their store. If you have a Steam account, please vote for us, favorite, and share with your friends. Note: In order to vote on Steam Greenlight you have to have purchased a game. They do this to prevent spam accounts from voting. We have nearly reached $5000, one third of our overall goal in a matter of days. Thank you guys so much. We couldn't have made it this far without your support. The winners for the OUYA Create contest are announced Monday, so cross your fingers for us! Have a great weekend! David Logan While conceptualizing Whispering Willows, we had a core mechanic but we didn't have a main character. Having interesting characters is one of the first steps to having an engaging, emergent story. With this in mind, we began considering what exactly we wanted in a main character. This was mid- 2012 when there was a lot of talk in the games industry regarding cookie-cutter characters that really only appealed to one audience: white males 18-35. We didn't want to make another Alex Shepard for people to play as. With such an individual driving story, you really only have the choice of a heroic, stalwart epic, and that's not what we wanted to go for, even from the start. So, we went ahead and began crafting an atypical character for the games world. We chose to make Elena, a young girl of mixed race that was more of a reluctant hero, pushed into the situation she must face. Going even further with trying to make the story of Whispering Willows unique, we didn't make Elena perfect – she has personal problems of her own that she'll have to get past in order to save her father. Overall, we really wanted to make an experience unparalleled to those others we primarily see in games, and we believe Elena is the key to doing that. Writer/Narrative Designer Kyle Holmquist Hello backers! This has always been one of my life goals to launch a Kickstarter . I have been waiting for this launch day since a few years ago when I joined. Our programmer teased, "shouldn't your goal be to launch a successful Kickstarter?" and that was just the inspiration I needed to begin. Launching a Kickstarter is the best way to give back to my team and make Whispering Willows a truly phenomenal game. On Monday it was announced by Killscreen Daily that Whispering Willows was a finalist in three categories for the OUYA Create Game Jam - "Grand Prize, most Immersive, and best Visuals! This was an incredible honor. I appreciate each and every one of you that has supported Night Light Interactive and helped us get closer to our goals. We launched today and we already raised $1000! I will be updating backers throughout the next month with behind the scenes interviews, progress updates, and rewards. If you haven't yet, play the Kickstarter demo here or on our main page! Thank you so much, share our Kickstarter, and help my team achieve our dreams! Creator of Whispering Willows David Logan @Alex- Thanks! We've now officially released for every major platform and console! Any backers free to email me at david [at] nightlightint [dot] com and I can send you a code for your preferred console of choice. @lartomar2002- It's a far ways off, but we certainly hope to port to OUYA. We've been keeping in close contact with OUYA! :) @Dylan- I am going to private message you with your Humble Bundle key. @Omar- we just put the contents of the Deluxe Edition available on our page! <url>"Rudolf Flagg" is the name you want on the website (and it is on the list). Backers- please check your survey responses because we exported the list of names directly from Kickstarter! :) Hey Omar, currently no plans for either, but I do own a Wii U and would love to see the game come to that console! @Raphael - The survey helps us understand what the platform of choice is for our backers. It also helps us see how many keys we need to purchase for each platform. I would love to have all versions available to all backers, but I don't want to promise anything without knowing the overall cost. The reward description states OUYA, PC, Mac OR Linux, not all of them. If the platform I release on doesn't charge for keys, or for multiple platforms, then I will make multiple platforms available to backers. @Serena - I really appreciate all your support and I am glad you like all the content so much :) @Lucas - Yes we will be launching a PayPal after the campaign ends. @Syazwan Chan - Yes, I would like to bring it to GoG. It is one of the top places I would like to submit the game. @Everyone - Thank you so much for all the comments and support :) 46 hours to go! @govon - Yes it will be DRM free, but will also be available on platforms such as Steam. @Anaxphone - I hope Back to Bed makes it as well. It is a beautiful game. Thanks everyone for your kind words! We appreciate all the support! @TheChosenOne - Not at this point, but we are considering selling individual items after Kickstarter ends on our website. Some items will be Kickstarter exclusive though. @Lucas It's her father's jacket. So I guess...ask your dad? ;) @Alyssa- Yes, we intend to have Paypal available after Kickstarter is over. We will be selling some of the merchandise from the Kickstarter on our website, so you can purchase additional copies of the game, plushies, etc. Some swag will be Kickstarter exclusive though. We would love to include signed artwork! @Bucen- 1. Yes that is a known error and something we will be fixing. 2. Yes, we will be including a ton of sprite animation for Elena. We have a fantastic animation team that has been unable to get their hands fully into the project, but we will be smoothing out animation, adding tons more animations, etc. We are planning on having ghosts appear as "wisps" like you suggested (magic candle light). Then when you interact with them they will turn into their regular form. If you watch the newest teaser video there is much more detail added like cracks, spiderwebs, etc. You don't have to worry about the art an animation, that's our specialty! 3. Yes of course! We have a very deep and immersive narrative planned. This was just a gameplay demo created in 10 days for the OUYA Create Game Jam. It does not reflect the main game's final look, gameplay, etc. 4. Music will loop properly in the final game. Thanks for your thoughts and questions! I will add a few of these to the FAQ! Great ideas Alyssa! A map will definitely be included. We would likely be posting facts about the different characters and locations at the bottom of the pages. Great idea about signing the art books. We will do that. I'll make an official announcement soon when I talk more about what will be inside. Thanks everyone for your comments and feedback! Lucas- we have considered the ability of possession and although is it not currently planned to be implemented, we would like to play with the idea more in the future. Alyssa- the hard cover art book is going to be beautiful! I think you will be very satisfied. What kinds of things would you like to see in it? Currently we are planning on implementing concept art, promotional material, in game art, and biographies on characters and locations! Congrats upon your arrival on Wii U, that's super-cool! Now, is there any chance that us backers who are Nintendo fans will get an eShop download code, pretty-please? ;-) Will "Nomad" be ported to Ouya? I am...a bit lost. I don't know how to claim my game. How do you know what my Humble account is? I was never asked...and there is no game in my Humble library. I saw that there is a delixe Edition on steam, but is it possible to sell the contents of the Deluxe Edition as DLC? As I would like to buy the art book/OST, but I don't want to rebuy the game. Sorry - update #75. This is from David Logan in Update #5 - "There will be a Steam key added to each of your Humble Store pages on July 9th." Because of timezones, it may be a little early yet. Steam provides keys free to their devs; all the devs have to do is ask for them. With that said, is it correct to assume you'll be providing Steam keys to backers who want them? Full Steam ahead! Geddit? :) Hi, I liked very much the first chapters so far, the mood and the pacing are nice. I however have a wishlist for the final release : - 64bit binary has disapeared in the june 17th release while it was in the may 13th's. (Linux version I've not been through others) 64bit is now quite wide spread amongst linux users and 32bit compatibility is quite a hassle - if 64bit version is discarded, the edition of linux packages is even more required. As it may automagically install only the required 32bit libraries. deb and rpm would be nice - the designs are sleak, and it's quite a shame that they are spoiled by the tearing. While I have vertical sync activated in the nvidia settings, it seems it's disabled in the game. Maybe adding an option for this in the menu. - the cursor should vanish as it's useless in the game. I really liked Whispering Willows so far. But if I may would like to suggest a little story change. (I will try to keep this "spoiler-less", but I hope you still understand, what I mean): Not being able to enter the mansion seems to feel wrong, because at this point the player can not know that the mansion would not help on his actual task in finding flying hawk. Why not lock the door and have flying hawks body have a key for that? When will we be getting our Ouya redeeming codes? Hello @David Logan - So what's the big news? April has come and gone with May half-way though, is there any news from you? I still have questions about controller support/Framefate, but I can't get them until the game is in our hands. Now that it will come out on steam with the soundtrack/artbook be available as DLC? This is truly off-topic, but are there any plans to make a fully 3D Whispering Willows? Any update on a release date for the OUYA or at least a "hi we're still alive and working on it" posting? Where is the update on a release date? Congratulations on winning first place at the Seattle Indie Game Competition. Way to go. Wish you much success in the future. @David Logan - Thanks for the reply, and that is great to hear. As I think ~60 FPS makes game look smooth and better in the long run. @David - nice progress with the game. Will there be v-sync (for a target of 30 or 60 fps) option for the game at it's final state? So I'm going to ask again, with the game coming on the OUYA (as the main version), will the PC version have controller support? When is Chapter 1 coming out? Hi. I noticed that this game has not been Greenlit yet, and the release of the first episode is coming soon. Is there a cause for concern here? I'm planning to redeem it on GOG.com, but it would be bad if the backers who chose to redeem it on Steam cannot do so. Hey there I do not see a Unity web player for Linux. Hey there what about a Linux demo I have not seen anything yet? I appear to have missed responding to the survey by mistake. Is there anything I can do? Am I doomed? It's July so that means it will be released around the corner? Any estimate when the game will be ready for the Ouya? Any info on the game? Anything new added, maybe full control support if greenlit by steam? Maybe how high is the game on the greenlight list? No name on the website.. hmm :/ @ Mr. Logan: Thanks for the reply. I'm looking forward to the game on the PC and have a good day. If this game becomes successful is there any chance of a 3D model remake for the PC? Will this game be port to the Wii U? Congrats on getting the bundle-in-a-box Indie Dev Grant! Same as Jeroen. Also, it's not quite clear to me why we'll have to decide for one platform. Other campaigns have been using humblebundle.com to deliver, offering all platforms. I'm looking at the survey and as the Ouya isn't out yet, I'm not sure if I should get the Ouya version or just the PC version... Congratulations! isitdoneyetisitdoneyetisitdoneyetisitdoneyetisitdoneyetisitdoneyet? UK here as well congratulations! This is good to wake up to! (UK). Gratz, everyone. :) Thank you so much everyone!!! :) This is really awesome. Congratulations! :D I volunteer to be the spirit avatar mother of Elena who has something to do with the disappearance of her father. A hearty conglaturations! (That Ghostbusters on NES joke will *never* get old.) Yes! Now here's to a successful PayPal followthrough! Congratz on making funding! 69 minutes to go! Larry salute! But of course. @Anaxphone: But of course. You got me to pledge to this, after all. ;) Welcome to the SE tier, Serena. It does have nice music, doesn't it? Not a bad choice for CoC at all. *goes and looks* Dammit. I'm sure I can count on you to remind me of this project further down the line, can't I? I just heard the sample music on the home page and I just had to jump up to $25 for the soundtrack. That will go great with my next Cthulhu RPG campaign...Acthung! Cthulhu, a Lovecraft PnP set during World War II...going on now as a Kickstarter (just click on my avatar and check it out if interested). --End shameless KS plug-- 69 comments and 96 at the end of the funding amount. Larry salutes you! Have you considered continuing a PayPal campaign after the Kickstarter ends? @David Logan: Congratulations on being funded and reaching the first stretch goal! Yay, you guys hit the 20k mark! Congrats! @Serena, that's hardly a sentiment I can object to. And again, my apology for tossing interesting projects in your way repeatedly. @Anaxphone: I might have to drop my pledge (or even pull out entirely) on Torment, but I'd rather my money go towards the smaller devs. @S.D. Hahahah! @Serena, Sorry, but so many good projects I can't help talking about. I can't believe that I'm backing yet another Kickstarter, but I'm in for just a little bit. Agustin, Anaxphone, and a couple shout-outs from other projects got me to check it out, but the demo sold me. And, for those who care, this is my 69th project. LARRY SALUTE! Glad to see the game is having a good final push. It will be nice to see solid indie games like this on the OUYA @Anaxphone: Cool! I nearly understood what you wrote. I recommend t-shirt 1: red; 2: navy blue with Elena in light blue; 3: in yellow and 4: should stay black :D Yes. I commented on them answering my question with that update in the comments on the update. ;) @Anaxaphone - the info is in the update: " If we hit the goal I will be sending out surveys so you can vote on the language you want to see the game translated for most. " @David Logan- Back to Bed just hit its basic goals and is less than $1000 from porting to Linux, Ouya, and Android. Now will there be a poll to backers after this closes for the languages or did I miss the poll for it? We're only $404 from the first stretch goal! Nice, S.D. Thanks, Arrowstorm! And the translation goal seems quite reachable, Russel, so on to getting the Android one! ;) Best of luck with your translation stretch-goal. :) Hey, all - the folks at Arrowstorm Entertainment posted a nice update, a couple of hours ago, to help out this project (my wife, the Lurker backed their project). Check it out here: <url>~mya And you guys are funded already! Awesome. Now here's hoping Back to Bed does as well so that I can be swamped with surreal, beautiful games to play. Dammit, Bedtime Games! You just had to make me look over here, didn't you? Congratulations on the 15K! Will Whispering Willows be drm-free? Congrats! yey! Hope you guys make it. Less than $1000 to go! Just pledged. This game reminds me of Another Code: Two Memories by Cing. I hope it'll have the same kind of mysterious, creepy feel but not be too scary. !eeep your getting close! Almost there! Keep pushing! Backing for Linux & OUYA support, and for the unique art style. Good luck, Night Light! Whoo hoo! Less than $2300 to go until we're funded! :D @Leonard Challis lol no worries, this game could do with a lil more love :D @Lim Hoe Kit thanks for posting about this in the Dreamfall KS :) Hi guys :) looks like a pretty game, love the concept. Glad to be here! Found Whispering Willows on kickstarter just recently, this looks great! Upped pledge, good luck! ~mya Good luck you guys! Hope this little bit helps! Any chance the book can be created as an addon? I'd rather not go from 25 to 100(+). This looks fantastic! I hope you'll meet your goal. I'm really looking forward to the day this game is finished!! I seriously can't wait. My dad is in prison. So no, I don't think that'll work. :( Dude, I want her jacket. :3 Oh my gosh, please ignore all the grammatical mistakes in that last comment and wrong punctuation! I just woke up and I didn't reread to catch my phones "spellchecked" words. XD Hey Bucen! I see you got my advertisement of this game? Haha I know the creators of Cryamore don't mind advertising of other games, so that's why I did it. I'm glad it caught your attention! While I don't know all of the answers to your questions, I do know that the animation will be improved and is temporary. In the new teaser trailer updates comments David addresses this to another backer stating it was temporary and they have very talented animation artists who have worked for Disney and Nickelodeon! Hope that eases your concern to one of your questions! :) So, just a few questions and remarks. 1. I just killed the demo XD While in ghost form I pressed repeatedly left rigth left right and the ghost froze, everything else was still working. Oh wait, it also happens in Elena mode. 2. Will we get more sprites of Elena? the ladder flowing down and the (missing english word here) desk(?) she was moving were kind of awkward and rather of putting, so an animation that she is doing something would be nice. Otherwise it would remind me of bad flash-based adventure/puzzle games, and this is quite annoying. Also it would be nice (and it is probably planned) that Elene also is animated when creating the projection, and an end animation when the projection disappears. And already present ghost shouldn't just be there if you turn on ghost mode, maybe use the same effect as used when ghost elena turns into magic candle light? Also a bit more decoration inside the rooms would be nice, they feel a bit... well... empty. It's a ghost masion, so there should be spider webs, dust and so on. Also why are the ghosts more extreme outlined than ghost elena? Shouldn't it be all the same style? 3. Will it be explained WHY she can use Astral Projection? She 'just happens to have' Astral Projection because it runs in the family would be a bit of bad story telling, especially if your goal is an engaging story. But let me guess. It is part of the story and the player has to find it out by himself? 4. Music is awesome. Really fitting the theme. It just doesn't loop well, but probably all things you guys are working on. Here you go, also I raised my pledge, looks fascinating, could all just be a tad more 'fluent' to be even more engaging so, I just pledged 10 bucks, as I have seen it advertised on another project (is this even allowed ;) ), anyway, I have yet to see the video and read all the details, but just skimming through the home page (looking at the pictures) I had to atleast put 10$ on it. As I am on a worktrip and won't be home till the 13th, I don't want to completely forget this project. So when I have a bit more time later, I will pledge the 'appropriate' amount ;) That's great David, I cannot wait to see what it looks like! I know it shall be fantastic! I also have a few questions if you don't mind me asking. Will you launch a PayPal support as well? I know several campaigns who have done this, some before and some after the kickstarter ended to give an extra boost for those who don't have credit cards or amazon. How do you feel about having add-ons to your kickstarter? For example, if someone wanted another T-shirt they add X amount of dollars to their current pledge, or even a second copy of the game one for Ouya and one for PC. You could also make original artwork or prints (signed or unsigned) add-ons as well. These are just suggestions because I've seen a few kickstarters rack up a fair amount with these add-ons from even current backers. @David - I would love to see all of what you stated! Would you consider perhaps having a map or layout of the mansion? I think that would be a neat little addition. Also how about little tips on the bottom of some pages or something? Not like major spoilers or anything just little tips or tidbits of the Willows mansion. Also I wouldn't mind seeing it autographed by the team! ;) Yep, no ands ifs or buts about it...I needed to upgrade to that artbook! I had no choice in the matter. Man oh man does my credit card hate me lately! I hope this gets funded! Looks amazing! Definitely looks like it's going to be neat. I only wish the main character had the ability to possess other people and objects, but I guess that's not what this game is all about. Can't wait to see the final product! Watching the Alive and Kicking Livestream now! Looks great! love the idea of these little story vignettes attached to the detective gameplay Looks like a neat game, guy! Best of luck to you! Looks like a really cute concept, good luck!
