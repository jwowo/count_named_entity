** This Kickstarter campaign is a two-week gift special from December 4 through December 17 with a heavy discount over normal prices on custom handmade Seedling Gift Kits. We'll get in touch with you after you back your pledge for variety preferences and mailing directions. We start shipping all rewards on December 18, 2014. The beautiful, easy way to start growing edible plants, flowers and trees at home! The growing medium is layered inside an earth-friendly container made from 100% recycled PET and aluminum (repurposed tennis ball cans recovered from Southern California tennis teams). No raw plastics or metals are used in the container and each kit prevents an extraordinarily high amount of air volume in landfills from these sturdy, rigid containers. Melaleuca quinquenervia ("Paperbark Tree") At the base of the Seedling Kit is a handmade mulch created from the spongy bark of the "Paperbark Tree" (Melaleuca quinquenervia), both a sustainable resource and an attractive slice of life! The mulch assists air circulation and provides a foundation for the root base. This same Paperbark is used to form a handsome gift tag attached to each Seedling Kit. The growing medium is a proprietary blend of organic ingredients that's thoroughly researched, tested and designed to provide the optimal ratio of basic nutrients while providing a wide range of trace minerals and beneficial, biological compounds. There's a small instructional foldaway that accompanies each kit along with extra links to online educational resources. During the campaign, you'll be able to choose from a variety of organic and heirloom seeds to include inside your Seedling Kits. For this Holiday Season's Kickstarter special, a two-pack is available for $10 to $15 plus $5 shipping. We recommend a combination between fast-growing kitchen herbs like Basil, Cilantro or Parsley and a slow-growing but long-living and bountiful herb like Rosemary, Mint or Sage. We also have a variety of Flowers you may choose from. Dear Backers: Everyone is getting a direct message today requesting your seedling and shipping directions. Please get back to us ASAP so we can assemble your reward properly before our shipping day, this Thursday December the 18th. Regarding stretch goals: We had a few creative ideas in mind, but due to the overwhelmingly positive response -- especially over this past weekend -- we've decided to focus on the most important task of delivering everyone's backer rewards on time. However, there are a few "stretch-goal-sorta" options we'll put out there just in case anyone wants them... A: Raise your pledge by $1 per Seedling Kit and we'll leave the top lid label blank for your own handwriting and/or craftiness (as opposed to the Paper, Seed &amp; Tree Co. branding as seen in our first project update). B: Raise your pledge by $2 for each Seedling Kit you'd like to receive GREEN-colored lids instead of the standard, black-colored lids (choose blank or PS&amp;T labels. Limited to 10 backers). C: Raise your pledge by $3 for each Seedling Kit you'd like to receive RED-colored lids instead of the standard, black-colored lids (choose blank or PS&amp;T labels. Limited to 10 backers). E: Raise your pledge by $4 for each Seedling Kit you'd like receive GOLD-colored lids instead of the standard, black-colored lids (choose blank or PS&amp;T labels. Limited to 5 backers). Thank you again for backing Seedling Gift Kits for the 2014 December holiday season! We look forward to shipping every one of your rewards this Thursday. Best, Paper, Seed &amp; Tree Co. (PS&amp;T) We're very pleased to build and deliver so many Seedling Kits for you this holiday season! In the first four days of this campaign, we've become a team with 33 backers and 250% of the entry goal. Thank you! It's unconventional to ship the very next day after our Kickstarter ends. Moreover, it's both a feat and a treat to deliver our products inside the fast-paced schedule of the holidays. Assembly has begun and we're reaching out to all of our backers this week to survey everyone's pick for certified organic seed, gift tag preferences and shipping direction. Look out for an email / Kickstarter message this week! If you're not yet a backer, we encourage you to grab one of the early bird deals before they're gone! Our Etsy shop will be selling two-pack Seedling Kits™ next year for $15 plus shipping. Stay tuned for more updates, -Paper, Seed &amp; Tree Co. Hi Nancy, Yes... I'll send your tracking number once it's prepared. Thank you for your patience! There are still many backers waiting on their rewards. The bottom line is this: Today is truthfully, the last day of waiting. Everything ships first thing tomorrow -- really. The reason you haven't heard from me yet is that I didn't want to give you another expected delivery date that doesn't come through. Your Seedling Kits were 95% done but this final 5% has been the hardest part. I've been squarely focused on getting these out the door and have been the only one working to fulfill your orders this past week; it's the only thing I'm doing. Everything else is on hold. The team I hired to work with me before the holidays never expected it would extend this long and couldn't change their schedules to participate on short notice. When this is all over (starting tomorrow), I'm going to produce a video demonstrating the assembly and packing process. I'll also put together a summary of all the pitfalls and roadblocks we ran into during the past month. This is for our own benefit and growth, but I'll share it with all of you for transparency's sake in case anyone's curious. The truth is, while there's been a great deal of frustration and disappointment from both sides, the Kickstarter process has proven to be extremely valuable. By learning from all these obstacles, we're able to refine our system and develop a company that's more tenacious entering the traditional marketplace. Without the valuable lessons learned here, with all of you, we simply would not succeed. So with that, a big thank you for your support and patience. We're coming through. It all ends tonight! For those still waiting to hear from me - we hit another snag in the assembly line and my entire focus is getting production running again... It really is our goal to have shipped *everything* before the last pickup Saturday. At the time of this comment, the official 24-hour countdown begins. I will have tracking numbers by tomorrow for all remaining backers. Thank you for your patience and tolerance. Bear with us, it's taking time considerable effort to get packages out the door while simultaneously writing to everyone personally. If you haven't heard from us yet, you have not been forgotten. @Jared - Check your inbox in 5 minutes. @Lance - was just sending you a DM now. Check your messages in a few minutes. @Babezor - glad we resolved everything yesterday. @Jeremy - Check your DM @Jeremy - To the contrary, I did limit the sales. On the eve of our final day Dec 17, I took survey of what we had on hand and ended up spending over $300 that night on brand new tennis balls in order to have enough containers. The following morning, I awoke to discover our campaign was featured in the Kickstarter newsletter. That unexpected publicity drove 42 new backers before I had a chance to mark all rewards as "sold out," effectively shutting the campaign down despite hundreds of potential new backers if the campaign continued. This was a tough decision and you can imagine a project creator's eyes glazing over at the growth potential. Ultimately, the logistical bottlenecks went beyond a pinch for materials and labor. Must get back to fulfillment. I'll follow up with you personally in our direct message feed once we finish. Thanks. I'm repeating this message in today's backer-wide update and will send personal messages later today to everyone who's still expecting their rewards: ***All delayed packages ship tonight and tomorrow morning*** Dear Backers, As you know, this Kickstarter exceeded its goal by 10x. When the campaign began on December 14, we had staff and materials on hand to assemble up to 4-5x the goal. I pulled out as many stops I could to deliver the last minute surge in orders. Ultimately, we were unprepared to handle the sheer volume. Everyone else involved went home for the holidays and I was left to finish assembling hundreds of Seedling Kits on my own. There were several logistical bottlenecks (gathering more containers, soil, organic nutrients, seeds, labels, packaging materials). It came to a head on Dec 23 when the USPS website stopped cooperating. I missed seeing my own family on Christmas as well as my friends on New Years. Instead, I was in the garage trying to assemble the remaining orders. Without external help and under tremendous pressure, I neglected the task of providing updates. This was a mistake. To those of you who are upset, I sincerely apologize. I share your frustration and disappointment. When a Kickstarter campaign exceeds its goal several times over, delays can take months -- sometimes much longer. I've backed projects in 2013 that I'm still waiting and hoping for. I hope most of you will forgive our delay due to the fact that we're 10x over the goal --- yet managing to fulfill 3 weeks late, not 3 months late. In our direct messages today, I'll provide your new USPS tracking number and my personal cell phone number. I hope we can rebuild some confidence in the future. We've learned a great number of lessons and insights from this experience and our intention to provide the best customer support we possibly can going forward. Though delayed, I'm confident you'll enjoy the value and workmanship in our Seedling Kits. Thank you for supporting us, - Jason van Buren Founder, "Paper, Seed & Tree Co." To anyone who's missing shipments or has direct questions/issues.... I'm back at the Kickstarter helm and you'll be hearing from me within the next 24 hours in our direct message feed. There's several shipments leaving the studio today and Monday. I'm working as fast as I can to fulfill the remaining orders given the logistical restraints. Thank you for bearing with us!! @Kyle - I could have sworn I sent you a direct message on the 23rd, but I don't see it in our feed. I'm sorry. Yet another entry into our journal of mishaps to account for and learn from. I'll repeat this in a DM to you, but here's the summary since it's a matter of public record now: Your shipment was part of a final batch to leave our studio via 1-Day Priority Express on December 23, but we were unable to create new postage labels on the USPS website past noon that day. There were only a handful of shipping labels printed before the website broke down ---yours was one of the few. I asked those working with me to prepare as many boxes as possible, regardless of content. You and I had spoken over DM previously and I knew you wanted to gift these on Christmas day. The 6-pack of random kits you received was a desperate attempt to get SOMETHING to you, knowing we would send the 10-pack of Seedling Kits you actually requested once the USPS website was back up and running again. In other words, the package we sent you in haste was part of a last-ditch effort on Christmas Eve --- we lost a race against the clock. That was a most stressful and panicked day. The ones you want are en-route, and I'll send you that tracking number in our DM feed. I know this is still disappointing, and I hope you can forgive us. We were all caught off guard with the volume of these rewards and the USPS website failure. I'm doing my best to satisfy every backer despite the delivery timetable for some. Let's continue the dialogue in our DM feed. Thank you for your feedback and understanding. I hope in time we become one of your BEST experiences here. After-all, it's best to keep the gift-giving season going. @Option8, We made a backer-wide update and set you a direct message on the morning of December 16 -- it shows up in our feed, but I'm sorry you didn't find it in your email or Kickstarter inbox. I see now that you've responded with the choices and shipping detail. Thank you. We'll get back to you shortly. It's true, we're definitely overwhelmed and exhausted by the flood of unexpected orders. Hopefully you can understand that we weren't prepared for 10 times our goal. But we're doing all we can respond to you in our direct message feed with the latest. There will a backer-wide update by 11:59 PST tonight. Kyle I'm still going through the list of backers... you're in the queue. A lot is happening at once today. You're still getting yours before Christmas. Look out for my direct message within the hour. If anyone else is reading this, we're getting to you. It's taking us a while due to the unexpected avalanche of orders that came in on the final day of our campaign. We appreciate your patience and hope that everyone who wants theirs before Christmas gets them on time. Hi Huston, you're next! Hi Jeremy, just sent you a DM now. Been getting back to everyone individually for several hours now and we're all hard at work getting these things out! Also to anyone who hasn't yet provided their SHIPPING ADDRESS or PLANT CHOICES, we've crossed the threshold to deliver before Christmas without shipping USPS Overnight Express. For most, this is a $20-30 increase that we can accept over Amazon Payments or Paypal. We'll be trying you all one more time tomorrow over direct message, but we're also scrambling as it is to finish everyone's orders who got back to our message on time. Hi Noel... I'm out buying more printer ink cartridges at the moment but will send you your tracking info when I return to the studio. Anyone else who's still waiting will hear from me tonight. I'm sorry about the delay. We're scrambling to fulfill everyone's orders. Hi Jared -- Yes, received your DM this morning. Will make sure your shipment arrives on time. Yes -- everyone will receive a direct message with their USPS tracking number this weekend. Right now we're pulling out the stops, trying to get everything boxed up and into the back of a mail truck. A surge of new backers on the final two days on the campaign is making us work double-time. We're still on track to deliver before Christmas, though some may receive their packages on the 24th rather than the initial goal of the 23rd simply due to the somewhat unexpected, high volume of orders. We're hoping this won't disappoint anyone--but if does--please send us a direct message or email ( <email> ) and we'll try to accommodate. Also, there are several backers who haven't yet responded with shipping addresses and seed choices. We're reaching out to those individuals again to try to get their data in time to deliver by the 24th. If you're one of those and reading this now, please send us your info ASAP! Thank you all again for your support. We'll be in touch. And for us now--it's back to work! Dear Backers: Everyone is getting a direct message today requesting your seedling and shipping directions. Please get back to us ASAP so we can assemble your reward properly before our shipping day, this Thursday December 18. Regarding stretch goals: We had a few creative ideas in mind, but due to the overwhelmingly positive response -- especially over this past weekend -- we've decided to focus on the most important task of delivering everyone's backer rewards on time. However, there are a few "stretch-goal-sorta" options we'll put out there just in case anyone wants them... A: Raise your pledge by $1 per Seedling Kit and we'll leave the top cap label blank for your own handwriting and/or craftiness (as opposed to the Paper, Seed & Tree Co. labeling as seen in our first project update). B: Raise your pledge by $2 for each Seedling Kit you'd like to receive GREEN colored lids instead of standard BLACK colored lids (choose blank or PS&T labels. Limited to 10 backers) C: Raise your pledge by $3 for each Seedling Kit you'd like to receive RED colored lids instead of standard BLACK colored lids (choose blank or PS&T labels. Limited to 10 backers) E: Raise your pledge by $4 for each Seedling Kit you'd like receive GOLD colored lids instead of standard BLACK colored lids. (choose blank or PS&T labels. Limited to 5 backers) Thank you again for backing Seedling Gift Kits for the 2014 December holiday season! We look forward to shipping every one of your rewards this Thursday. Best, Paper, Seed & Tree Co. (PS&T) @Megan, Yes! We have a few stretch goals lined up. Look out for an update this weekend. @Jared, Thank you! We sure hope so. Watching a plant grow is impressive to all ages! Hi Noel, yes there are five holes at the bottom of the Seedlng Kit for water drainage and air circulation. Absolutely! Add up the total amounts (with shipping) for each reward you'd like, then send us a direct message to let us know what packages you'd like. Still nothing. Three years since the promised delivery date. I accepted delivery after Christmas. I guess I should have gotten a new promised delivery date. Still waiting... Still nothing OCTOBER 4TH AND STILL NO CONTACT OR ITEM. I've just left a comment on one of his posts on his Facebook page (Jason van Buren). Maybe his friends will notice if many of us start asking this way about where our kickstarter rewards are. Also, this is definitely his page. It has the same photo as his kickstarter profile. Jared - good point. I am not sure how to delete a post. Jason is from LA - went to UCLA according to his website and this is an LA address. Still - if you know how to delete a post please let me know. @Cheryl this is a bit touchy and not sure that I would add this personal information. What if it was not the same person? now 150 would be harassing someone who was not involved. I am not defending him or his actions but this is not the right thing to do JUST because we do not have accurate information. This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. Nice way for Jason Van Buren to make a quick $5,047. Hope he sleeps well at night knowing he ripped everyone off! @Kelly Totally agree. I think though we should keep this thread up.. we could turn this into a support group Jason Van Buren is probably hoping that people have forgotten about this by now. I hope he enjoyed spending our money. At least his name will be associated with this whenever someone googles him. @Erin.. basically. this is the chance we take when we support someone in kickstarter So, what? This guys just taking our money then? I love the fact that this guy last logged in on May 14th... Never got anything, but reading from the backers who got what they paid for, I guess I am glad I didn't go through the pain of not seeing anything grow. Kickstater needs to have a ranking system where we can give a creator 1 star for a job poorly done. Fool me once.. I was one of the "lucky" ones and actually got what I ordered in late January. I followed the directions on the package, and nothing has ever germinated. My outlay was small and I am not concerned, but this guy needs to step up and right what he wronged, especially to the people who never got what they ordered. I don't know how he sleeps at night knowing that he ripped folks off. I reached out to Kickstarter as well. And got a generic response about how they would try to contact the creator. If there is anyone here who lives in California, and paid for one of the more expensive packages, you can try filing a claim in small claims court. The filing fee for claims less than $1500 is $30. Maybe if Jason van Buren realizes he can be held legally accountable for stealing other peoples money, he may refund it or actually provide the product that was paid for. The section is penal code 484-502.9 "(a) Every person who shall feloniously steal, take, carry, lead, or drive away the personal property of another, or who shall fraudulently appropriate property which has been entrusted to him or her, or who shall knowingly and designedly, by any false or fraudulent representation or pretense, defraud any other person of money, labor or real or personal property, or who causes or procures others to report falsely of his or her wealth or mercantile character and by thus imposing upon any person, obtains credit and thereby fraudulently gets or obtains possession of money, or property or obtains the labor or service of another, is guilty of theft." After MANY attempts to contact Jason Van Buren, and two tickets started with the hopes of enlisting the help of Kickstarter Support I have still not received my 4 seedling gift kits or a refund of my $30. I emailed Jason yesterday reminding him of the Golden Rule (RE: "Be respectful and considerate") and CC'd Kickstarter support. Their reply was to use the "Contact Me" button to reach the project creater, which I then informed them on this project is no longer available. They sent back a patronizing email which included a sentence saying they've reached out to this project creator. Below is my final reply to Kickstarter - I would encourage the other backers whose money was taken to also let Kickstarter know how this made YOU feel: "I was excited about Kickstarter, but now the trust is gone. The only financial risk I was informed about and consented to when backing this project was losing my money if the project was not successful. This one was picked out as a Kickstarter Staff Favorite, and WAY exceeded its goal. I never knew that extreme success of a project could also result in me losing my money given in faith and trust. If by "reaching out" you mean that you emailed him, good luck. I would try calling him, over and over. Maybe you could help regain the trust of the backers that got ripped off by Jason VanBuren if you right this wrong. Maybe if I experienced an acceptable outcome I would feel ok backing other projects in the future." To be sure u have correct contact it is <email> I've very politely reached out to Paper Seed and Tree using any contact information I can find, and I have received no response whatsoever. I would rather they be honest and give me an answer I may not want to hear, but the absolute communications blackout is frustrating. Do keep an eye on his next project (mother/father day is coming) and make sure to alert the backers about his way of doing business. Josh - you're assuming others weren't also respectful in their replies. I sent over 10 messages and was very respectful, expressing my understanding for the delay. The issue is he pocketed over $5,000 of other people's money, money people worked hard for, and didn't even have the decency to send a message explaining why all of the packages still haven't been delivered. On January 11 this was the comment that was posted "There are still many backers waiting on their rewards. The bottom line is this: Today is truthfully, the last day of waiting. Everything ships first thing tomorrow -- really." Today is March 18, and there have been no further messages. I don't think anyone is faulting him for the delay, people are faulting him for the lack of communication. Ultimately, if you want to run a successful business you need to be transparent and give people what they ordered. If you don't, it comes across as a scam. Quite frankly, right now he is stealing other peoples money, as he has not provided the product that was paid for. People have been held liable in small claims court for less. I still haven't gotten my package. I have received 1 email back over a month ago saying he printed my shipping label. His email address is <email> You made me do my first and only chargeback on my credit card. That sucks. Josh, it's not the delay that we are concerned about as we all know that delays happen on Kickstarter. It's the lack of communication (and multiple broken shipment date promises) that is causing the frustration. Which in turn, means that many of us doubt whether we'll get our hands on what we pledged for. I received mine. It is what was advertised, had instructions and the easier one worked. Guys he explained what happened, he wasn't expecting to get slammed like that. And you are lucky if this was your first wait through Kickstarter. Calm down. I was respectful in my questions and got a reply. Try it. Michael, I get it, but there is no excuse for no communication I received an email today. I was informed that my shipment went out today. I will keep yall posted. From what I understand, the owner is a young entrepreneur, and bit off more than he could chew. He seems to be actively trying to make good on his promises but it is slow going. As a small business man I understand the challenges and fears of owning a startup. Making mistakes is ok. Late delivery is even ok, after all, we are paying into startups. I hope he digs deep and makes good to his orders. I still have not received my seedlings, nor have I received any communication from the company, despite having sent them a few emails. I still have not received my seedlings, nor have I received any communication from the company, despite having sent them a few emails. I still have not received my seedlings, nor have I received any communication from the company, despite having sent them a few emails. This is the owners name Jason van Buren Paper, Seed & Tree Co. I would like to hear from the cowards who started this project I think it is ridiculous and Kickstarter don't take some responsibility here and help get our money back, this is a scam which they endorsed! .. Not happy! It really is sad. I feel for everyone who did not get what they asked for. I really hope they do not create another kickstarter and try this again. I would probably pledge and just warn everyone if they do this again... This makes me sad :( My 1yr old & 3 yr old cousins never got their Christmas present and I lost all the money I spent :( 4 years and 36 projects later, this is the first time I've been genuinely burned by a KS project. I guess I should be thankful it was only $10 for me. Has anyone reported this to kickstarter? I want my money back! Does this radio silence means they've just taken our money and ran? Still haven't got mine! What's going on? I'm still waiting for my product and an update. At this point I'm not holding my breath. Such a disappointment. @stephen I received mine a few weeks ago... I **** a lot and reported them everyday Has ANYONE here received an update or even their product? I contacted the federal government and they immediately put me through to the president once they heard how serious the issue was. Legislation is going into effect on Monday banning all seedling related kickstarter ideas and putting their creators in prison. We can all rest easier knowing we won't get bamboozled again. Maybe a way to contact: From LinkedIn: Jason van Buren Founder at Paper, Seed & Tree Co. Santa Monica, California Consumer Goods Education University of California, Los Angeles Instragram account: <url>"Kickstarter does not guarantee projects or investigate a creator's ability to complete their project. On Kickstarter, backers (you!) ultimately decide the validity and worthiness of a project by whether they decide to fund it. " I was the 10th backer. No shipping notification, no communication. Multiple messages sent. I am posting here 2 days in advance of my reporting them to Kickstarter. I echo what others have said - I would have been happy and willing to wait if someone would have just communicated with me. How can 164 orders be a challenge? This is a joke. I received my package and it is totally ridiculous. A recycled tennis ball container that is a mess of tissue paper, soil and styrofoam. No instructions. Kickstarter should vet these people before accepting projects. This is an absolute joke. I still haven't received my ten set and the one half ass one they sent me hasn't grown one seedling out of the 10-15 seeds I have tried to plant. I have not gotten a package nor a tracking number, and our private messages since January second have gone unanswered. This is very disappointing. I never got anything. Other than a mail before the end of the year saying theyll ship next day. Sigh. It would be really nice to have an update on when these are going to ship. My little cousins are still waiting for their Christmas present I'm still waiting for an update and my package. Were all of the packages shipped? hi guys - i received my order and they were packaged well. i never got a tracking number or a DM from paper seed, and tree, but the package arrived anyway so there might still be good news for everyone else! I'm the first backer and I haven't heard anything! Still no tracking number here either. backer#39 have recd nothing Package arrived! Was given two bonus kits. They look a little messy but at least they're here. Still no product still no tracking number. What is going on? Paper seed and tree, I believe you when you say you've had a month full of obstacles filling the orders of the backers. I understand technology can be fickle especially around Christmas with UPS and that staffing can be lighter as priorities shift during and after the holidays. I understand the production aspect has hit some snags. I believe you on those. I am starting to doubt that you've "learned a lot" when it comes to how to speak to your customers and backers. You have said repeatedly that you will DM us with tracking numbers and information. The comments here all agree - we want communication. Maybe if you took the time to directly communicate with us, you could ask who needs their seedlings immediately and who would be willing to wait as long as February or March for delivery, and then you could adjust your production accordingly. If you communicated with us, you could reset our expectations on a very specific level, personally, instead of claiming actions you have yet to follow through. I, for one, would appreciate communication over expedited delivery. I can't speak for everyone, but you can speak to them to discover their own needs. Best, breé. I was Backer #22. And I have not heard anything. On Jan 6, 8, and 10th I sent messages with no response. What is going on? I have been trying to change what I put in my purvey since I have purchased Cilantro and Dill somewhere else. I would like 10 - Basil 16 - Oregano Finally got my order. Some of the packages had opened. Was a bit messy. Thank you for following through My tracking number still says pre shipment since the 27th. Also, they sent me a few jumbled mess seed kits before Christmas and none of them will grow anything. Pretty sure seedlings don't take 2+ weeks to sprout, and yes I did plant the seeds. I got mine yesterday, so looks like they're coming. If we haven't received a tracking number, does this mean that we are getting a refund? I haven't received anything either. What is going on here? I still haven't received my tracking number yet? Just curious when I am getting my tracking number? I just hope something comes in the mail this week so I can awkwardly give these belated gifts to my friends and family. thanks for taking the time and effort to get everything out - based on your last comment, does this mean that we will be getting our tracking numbers after all the kits are shipped tomorrow? i never heard from you guys since replying with my seed choices on the 16th so just wanted to make sure that waiting another day or so will definitely mean that the packages get delivered. Thanks again! Is there anybody on here who actually received what they paid for? I have yet to even receive a tracking number for mine From one of apparently many who are still waiting to hear from you. What is happening? You say be end of day you'll send everything out. Then at the end of the day..........nothing. Am I getting these seedlings or did I spend my money on nothing? Please let me know so I can advise others about your company. Would love to save others the disappointment. Order:Lance Hain: Paper, Seed & Tree Seedling Gift Kits.Please send me the following 6 seedlings: 1)Basil * 2)Cilantro * 3)Lavender * 4)Parsley * 5)Rosemary ** 6)Spearmint ** where is my order I'm still waiting on my DM as well... When am I on the list for a dm? Order:Lance Hain: Paper, Seed & Tree Seedling Gift Kits.Please send me the following 6 seedlings: 1)Basil * 2)Cilantro * 3)Lavender * 4)Parsley * 5)Rosemary ** 6)Spearmint ** where is my order Will send a DM as well, but hoping this gets seen. If I cannot get a refund, I NEED my order to be shipped to a different address. The people who were to receive the gift live in a different state, and they have returned home already. Please DM me ASAP! Thanks. It also apparently went beyond the ability to respond to multiple people's messages, comments, which led to disappoint and abhorrent communication which is evidence by multiple complaints to both kickstarter and Amazon. I have nothing to say to you personally that I will not say in comments. I sent multiple messages in private that were not answered and I feel no need to give you the courtesy I was not afforded. Here is the bottom line. You could have set reasonable limits for what could have been accomplished with supply and man hours. You didn't. You over sold what you didn't have. I've lost patience and sympathy. Honestly I just want a refund. I filed a complaint with Amazon payments, but they told me that they can't do anything. So, I'm going to dispute this with my bank now. I filed a complaint with Amazon payments too. I'm going to see if I can dispute the charge with my credit card company as well. This is the worst customer service experience I've ever had. I went ahead and filed a dispute with my credit card company I filed a complaint with Amazon payments. I'm done with this. I doubt there will be any refund considering their total silence, but if you payed them with a credit card, you have the right to call your credit card company and request a charge back. That is what I will be doing after work. I am tired of these kinds of projects. So where are non-rush orders? I'm all for patience, but I've hit my limit. Looks to me like they got overwhelmed and just walked away with our money I made a report to kickstarter as well. I didn't want to but this is ridiculous. I wonder if they had this bad of service the last few times they did Kickstarter campaigns. I'm just really glad I only spent $10. I doubt kickstarter will do anything, they usually say they are just the intermediary. But I don't blame you for the report. This is the worst experience I have had. yeah i sent a report to kickstarter this is insane... Interested in a refund. Doubt that's possible, but I'd rather have $30 toward bills than $30 toward a company that can't bother responding to me or any of us. I am feeling the frustration as well, and a refund would be much desired. The lack of communication has really caused me to reconsider supporting this project. If someone had at least responded directly to me, I would be more understanding, but customer service is extremely lacking. This is getting extremely frustrating. I have sent two messages and I still have not heard back or received a tracking number, despite being told I would receive a tracking number on 12/16. I bought these as Christmas gifts. And Christmas was a week ago. I understand the delay but communication needs to improve. I would consider a refund as well at this point. Still no communication and updates, The project creator has sent me a tracking number but it does not have any info on the package or any updates at all. It's stuck on the date December 23 I am about to that point as well. No communication no updates and no product until...sometime in 2015? Really bummed I never received my product! At this point I'd rather receive a refund as the seeds were all going to be Xmas gifts. Tomorrow is 2015. Laaaaaaame :/ "We start shipping all rewards on December 18, 2014." Will we receive our Christmas kits before you lust your "Valentine's Day Special" Kickstarter campaign? I wish they could AT LEAST give out an update to us customers.. I have a bad feeling @Jeremy - I agree, communication between creator and backers is essential. They definitely need someone to take care of this aspect. Still no product and I was told I would get on the 26th. Is this cause I wasn't willing to pay the 25.00 expedited shipping? Still no direct message, no response to direct messages, and no product. I understand the troubles that have been had, but communication needs to improve vastly The problem with this project is that it became a Kickstarter Staff Pick and the people behind the project were not prepare for it. They got 10 times more people than they were expecting. I know, they promised a Christmas delivery, but with this increase in demand, they got overwhelmed. It is understandable, they are humans, not robots. I think everyone should be patient. It is not like you are going to grow those plants in the middle of winter... Still no dm..... no product either... No product, no tracking info. Still waiting on mine as well.... Thanks Jason. Thanks for making this better and I apologize for being harsh. 3 parsley when I ordered zero parsley. 5 missing seed packets and 4 missing tubes and zero response from this kickstarter. This ranks as one of my worst experiences on here. I only received 6 instead of 10 that I pledged. Awesome. When are we supposed to receive our tracking numbers? Can someone please get back to me? I know you are all busy and it's Xmas, but I have written several DMs with no response. This is a time crunch gifting situation; please see my previous DMs and respond ASAP. Thanks! Still waiting on mine.. I hope we will receiving our seedlings sometime soon? I still haven't received mine, I know that I didn't get my address in on time so Im ok with that. I consider it an extended Christmas! I still have not received a direct message. USPS just dropped off today's packages from Amazon and no seedlings. Very disappointed as I was the 12th backer and ordered 10 for Christmas. Over promised and under delivered. I didnt get any email about choosing mine...and I totally forgot to check! Sooo...what should I do?! Same here Audrey. I just want to know if mine has even shipped yet. No tracking number here, either. � I provided my information before the 18th with no response. It now looks like I won't be getting these before Christmas. Very disappointed as this was Christmas presents for the whole family. Thanks for the update. You guys have been awesome! In the same boat as Jeremy Dixon. Didn't receive a tracking number. I never got tracking information nor a response to my DM I sent yesterday. Can someone please update me? Anyone got their tracking numbers? I was wondering if you received my address in time? sorry for being absent minded Hi! I was just wondering if we will get tracking information? @Creator Just wondering how the shipping is going? Nevermind... I found it! I never received a DM.. Where are we supposed to post what we would like? Just curious about the stretch goals? How do I pick which seedlings I'll get and what are the options? This is such a great gift idea. My youngest son will love this! Are you doing any stretch goals? Does the container have an outlet for the excess water to drain? Hello! Is it possible to purchase more than one reward?
