Extended Goals! Help take Crystal Catacombs to the Next Level!! Base Goal: Thanks to YOU, we've reached our goal! This will most definitely insure that Crystal Catacombs will become a reality! The support shown for Catacombs has been phenomenal and the best part is, we still have weeks to take it even further. So, I invite you to take part in the second stage of the Kickstarter fundraising... The extended goals. Map Editor: DONE! We will now do everything in our humble power to include with the final version of the game, a customizable map editor! Choose your Crystal Realm template and then customize it with room layouts and enemies galore! *If possible, we'd love to also incorporate some way for you to share your levels with friends. Crystal Realm Design Contest: Do you have an idea for a really cool Crystal Realm that you'd like to see included into the game? Well, guess what? Starting right now, I'm excited to announce that we'll be accepting entries for a backer inspired Crystal Realm design contest! Check out the Crystal Realm Design Contest FAQ for all the details! Co-op Multiplayer: Here's where the deal gets oh so sweet. If we reach this goal, we'll especially do everything within our most humbling of powers to give the gamers of the world the joy of being able to play Crystal Catacombs with friends! Imagine exploring a Crystal Realm with fellow comrades by your side! This feature would easily expand the potential of Crystal Catacombs to an entirely new level. It would also require a lot of energy but we would do our darndest to make this feature available to as many players as possible! Even though Levels or Lives currently consists of a small team, with your support, we could potentially acquire the necessary help and talent to make Crystal Catacombs into something truly special! _________________________________________________ General Info: Developer: Levels or Lives is Maxwell Jensen (Design/Art), Dustin Boyd (Project Management) and MaskedEpsilon (Music/SFX) Platform: Initially PC, Mac and Linux (if possible, ports to XBLA, iOS and Android would be great) Genre: 2D > Action RPG > Roguelike > Platformer Completion: Roughly 40% Crystal Catacombs: Crystal Catacombs is an exploration based action platformer that incorporates challenging roguelike mechanics combined within a multitude of unique and unpredictable procedurally generated (random) dungeons. The game includes dozens of different items, weapons, spells, enemies and bosses. It will also feature a customizable inventory and a stat based character upgrade system. "The gameplay mechanics and visual style of Crystal Catacombs are both greatly inspired by classic games such as Super Metroid and Castlevania. I've made a strong point to try and retain the same vintage appeal while also incorporating my own artistic/game design spin into the development of the game to help make it as fun and exciting as possible." -Maxwell Jensen Features: Procedurally generated dungeons with randomly chosen room layouts, enemies, special items, treasures and even bosses. No two experiences will ever be the same. Seven different Crystal Realms (levels) to explore. Each with their own unique enemies, traps, hazards, treasures and bosses. Encounter and fight over 20 different bosses and dozens of varying enemies. Discover over 20 Magical Artifacts that can be equipped and used to grant new abilities, such as a the Double Jump Boot, Dragon Armor, Crystal Skull and Grapple Spikes. Collect and choose from several different weapon classes including swords, whips, axes and bows. Each class also has different variations of each weapon type. Unleash an assortment of powerful magic spells ranging from fireballs to summoning powerful creatures to help aid you in battle. Gain experience points to level up and ultimately become a force of glorified and unadulterated power! _________________________________________________ The Story of Captain Vasil Ravencraft: "Captains log, after days of traveling across the open waters of Celestica I've almost reached my destination. In the center of the Dark Ocean lies a lone island. Upon its shores sits The Crystal Catacombs. A fabled fortress said to contain portals to different worlds. Alternate realms filled with a wealth of treasure, vast secrets... and great danger. Yet, no man has ever returned to tell the tale of what truly lies inside the Catacombs. As I write this, my fate is uncertain - but as I make my way into the dark abyss, my sense of adventure burns inside me like a great, illuminating flame... And so, I go forth." -Captain Vasil Ravencraft Captain Vasil Ravencraft and his Amazing Mechanical Airship. When not exploring the Catacombs, Vasil can return to the surface and enter his airship. Inside, Vasil can restore all HP/MP, save the games progress and use the Captains Chamber to store items for future use. _________________________________________________ Crystal Realms: Each dungeon theme inside the Catacombs will be procedurally generated based on specific properties. Depending on the theme, each varies by size, shape, difficulty (hazards and) enemy types (including bosses), potential artifacts and treasure amounts. Crystal Catacombs consists of seven different Crystal Realms (level themes). These Realms are unique in appearance and difficulty. Each Crystal Realm is designated to a specific floor within the Catacombs. When a Realm is completed the next floor will be accessible to the player, revealing a new Crystal Realm. "An ancient castle ruled by an army of the undead, ghouls and ghosts." "A lush tropical environment inhabited by exotic enemies and dangerous traps." "A smoldering world filled with maniacal demons and rivers of lava." "Deep below the surface, these caverns house untold terrors… Few men have made it this far." "A bone chilling world consisting of only the most resilient and ferocious beasts." "A strange metal fortress filled with machines that seem to come from another world..." ...and even deeper inside of the Crystal Catacombs lies the infinite madness of the 'Necron'. Only by defeating all Crystal Realms can you discover the true secret of the Crystal Catacombs... _________________________________________________ Item Categories: Several different item categories consisting of dozens of individual items can be found throughout the depths of the Catacombs. Items range from tools that aid Vasil in exploration to magical artifacts that grant powerful new abilities. Below are just a few of the different item types. Healing Items: Healing items include potions and cures for specific stat ailments. It's always a good idea to have a few of these in your inventory. Equipment Items: Equipment items include tools used to assist Vasil in reaching new areas and general exploration. Grappling Hook: Extends vertically until it makes contact with a surface, can be climbed. Jetpack: Can be used to maneuver through the air - but be careful, fuel is limited! iTab: Using the iTab will transport you to a random location inside the level... This can be good or bad (but always interesting). Special Items: Special items vary from temporary stat changers to granting Vasil the ability to perform otherwise, impossible feats. Eye of Xye: Used to reveal an undiscovered area of the level. Spirit Guide: Can be used to remotely control a small Spirit Guide to temporarily explore a level. Helpful when you're not sure which way to proceed. Portal: Can be used at any time to exit a level and return to the surface. Lifesavers when you find yourself in a dire situation. Artifacts: Artifacts are a unique item type in that they can be bound to Vasil to grant new abilities or stat changes. Over 20 Artifacts can be found and equipped throughout the span of the Catacombs. Crystal Skull: Enemies will drop twice the amount of crystal shards. Dragon Boot: Grants the power to dash with great speed. Grapple Spikes: Allows Vasil to kick-flip off of surfaces. Invaluable for exploring those hard to reach areas. Charge Stone: Vasil's equipped weapon can be charged to release a powerful attack. Just remember, this will also consume MP! Leap Feather: By ducking momentarily and then jumping, Vasil will quickly shoot far up the air. Even large chasms can be easily maneuvered through by equipping this artifact. _________________________________________________ Weapons and Spells: Weapons: Amongst the various weapon categories are many different sub-types, some even with special qualities (i.e. fire sword, ice whip, blood axe etc…). Each weapon also has a certain percentage chance of inflicting a critical hit. Swords - Well rounded weapons with average damage, range and speed stats. Axes - Powerful weapons with high damage but small range and low speed stats. Whips - With the ability to extend further than swords and axes, the whip grants Vasil good range with medium damage but suffers from lower speed. Bows - Excellent range, medium speed and low damage. To use a bow, Vasil must have arrows present in the inventory. Spells: Crystal Catacombs includes many different types of spells Vasil can learn to cast, ranging from fireballs, life absorbing lightning bolts, rapid fire plasma shots and even the ability to unleash powerful elemental attacks. MP is a limited commodity within the Catacombs so be sure to use magic wisely. Vasil conjures the 'Blizzard' spell against the titanic Jelly Snail. _________________________________________________ Outside Support: Since the development of Crystal Catacombs began a little over a year ago, the project has received some very supportive responses, feedback and attention. The fact that so many people have reached out and shown their support means a lot to us. It has proven that this is a project worth pursuing. Below are a few of the websites that have helped show their support for Crystal Catacombs. Featured on: Kotaku - written by Chris Carolan GameZebo - written by Jim Squires IndieGames.com - written by Tim W. Socialtimes - written by Reid McCarter Thrillest - written by Lee Breslouer Thumb-culture - interview with Maxwell, conducted by Pazbi Zavatzki _________________________________________________ Funding: Your contributions to Crystal Catacombs will go towards hiring a team of talented individuals to help take the game to the next level of development. This would include programmers, assisting artists, our musician and the cost of the rewards. If you've decided to support us, we give you our deepest gratitude. Thank you! I'll also be posting daily updates concerning all kinds of fun aspects about the game. DAILY UPDATES! Of course, don't forget to follow Crystal Catacombs on Facebook! -Artwork by Travis Reynolds Hey everybody! Crystal Catacombs is releasing tomorrow!!! Shortly after midnight tonight, you will all receive an email from Humble Bundle. This email will include instructions on how to download all of your digital Crystal Catacombs goodies! If you are one of the awesome few who gets to receive our nifty physical items, you can expect them to be in the mail this weekend! So, now would be a great time to inform us of any address changes. Thank you so much for supporting our project, and please send some feedback on the game once you get a chance to crack it open! Cheers, Dustin Boyd Details/Subscribe Here! Facebook Event Here! Hope to see ya there! :D -Maxwell Hey everyone, The Beta has officially been launched through the Humble Store ! To obtain your copy, head over to the download page and enter the same email address you used when backing the project. Stay tuned for version updates in the near future! For those of you looking to help shape the project, please send all questions, comments or suggestions to: <email>. We can also start a little forum Q&amp;A here as well :) Thanks! -Maxwell Dearest Backers, The first version of the (PC, Mac and Linux) Beta has been completed and is currently awaiting for distribution via the Humble Store . As soon as I get the thumbs up, I'll release another Update to officially notify all of our Beta Backers that the download is ready. Keep in mind, this is the very first official public release of the game. Expect many more Beta Updates from now until our newly announced February 1st release date. Those of you who will be playing the game may notice some strange bugs/glitches, as well as some unfinished assets/mechanics. Stats, descriptions and whatever else needs to be finished or revised will continuously be changing throughout the updates - she is evolving daily. As of now, the game is approximately 55-60% completed. This first Beta consists of the basic essentials to jump into the game and play through the three available realms. It really gives you a great sense of what the game is all about. The game itself has proven to be very challenging, fun and varied . I hope you enjoy it as much as I have. Personally, I love it - and I'm easily the games toughest critic. One thing I absolutely recommend is playing with a controller! The game is currently plug-and-play compatible with the Xbox 360 controller. I'd also like to take this time to welcome our newest team member to the Catacombs Family, Crescent Moon Games ! CMG will be acting as our Publisher and the forefront in the newly announced iOS and Android ports of Crystal Catacombs! Development on the mobile ports will kick into high gear after the initial release for the computer platforms - stay tuned for release details! The last bit of news I wanted to share with everyone is that for the first time since we began work on the actual development of the game - The ENTIRE Crystal Catacombs development team is now working together - in person! I've relocated to Arizona for the next few months to oversee the production/completion of the project. Super Fun Games has done a tremendous job - and now that we're working together on-site (just in this past first week) the game has solidified by leaps and bounds. I can't begin to tell you how much this is going to add to the efficiency of the project. It changes everything and you can definitely expect to see some great progress within the future Beta builds. See you in the Catacombs! -Maxwell Hey guys, First off - Beta News: The Beta development is coming along well. In the past few weeks the team has made some great progress. Currently, we are focusing on wrapping up loose ends and making sure everything works/looks/plays the way it's supposed to. A time consuming process indeed ... Stay tuned!... In the meantime: I invite you to please take a closer look at some of the enemy designs/animations I've created for Catacombs ! I've been working on these buggers what seems like FOREVER ... and I love each one as if it were my own abominable spawn. Awww. Whaddya think? Shameless Self Promotion: I've decided to update my portfolio site to try and attract some ' freelance Pixel/Art/Game/Design' work (gotta pay those bills and game development ain't cheap!). If you are interested -or know of anyone who might be- please feel free to contact me. I'd love to collaborate with some of our backers :D There's lots to check out here . I've been using this "Blogolio" for a few years now. Poke around the site and maybe even get a glimpse into my madness... Next Update: Developer Video #3 - Coming Soon! And don't forget to check out the latest Developer Video: Lost Jungles and Random Worlds! The video quality is not... great - but I'm working within my... technological limitations... OKAY!? Thanks everyone, Maxwell Dear Maxwell, Where is Crystal Catacombs!? Last summer I donated $__ to your project and since then I have not seen much of anything besides a few random updates with false dates. What gives?! You suck, -Grandma That is not an actual letter I've received from my Gram-Gram, but I feel that some of you may be starting to feel this way and I believe that is completely understandable. I have sucked at sharing information with you about this project - but it has nothing to do with negligence or a lack of interest. It’s because I’ve set a high standard for content. If I don’t feel like something is ready to be divulged and shared with the people that made this project possible, I won’t share it. I’ve dedicated the past three years of my life to Crystal Catacombs and by Mega Man’s buster, it will kill me before I see it not happen. I hope you understand that I would rather say nothing during development than release inadequate, filler information. I’m not here to bullshit you, my top priority is to use the money you gave us to create something worthy of your time. There isn’t a day that goes by where the team is not trying to get this game finished for you . At this point, our next goal is to release the Beta, which will contain the first several levels of the game wrapped up in a functional, cohesive and hopefully, entertaining package. We are trying very hard to make this happen for July 31st . As of now, the entire team is in revisions mode. I can share approximate, projected release dates with you but I’m not going to make false promises. I wish I knew exactly how the future of the development will play out but the truth is that Crystal Catacombs is an ambitious project being produced by a fairly small team of talented, dedicated, underpaid and overworked individuals. We have one shot to make a great first impression and show you all what we've been working so hard on. I’m optimistic that this project can be something that you will be proud to have contributed to but at this point, it simply needs more time to cook. The great thing about being a part of this new frontier that is crowd funded projects is that I have total control over what I want my project to be. I don’t have any producers or executives stepping in to make stupid changes or impose permanent deadlines. With this creative freedom, I've dedicated - NO, I've made it my responsibility as the Director/Designer/Artist of Crystal Catacombs to create something unique and enjoyable for you. This is my primary goal for the project. Stay tuned for the hopefully soon-to-be-released Beta’s details and thank you for your patience. -Maxwell Dearest backers, I apologize for the long absence. Levels or Lives and Super Fun Games have both been very hard at work on Crystal Catacombs. Aside from being our first game, this is by far the most ambitious project I’ve ever attempted to take on. The magnitude and scale of creating Crystal Catacombs is enormous - and seems to only get bigger. The game is coming along wonderfully. Every day presents us with new problems to solve, and if there is anything I’ve learned about game design – problem solving is the name of the game. If Crystal Catacombs was an ever-growing, bloodthirsty carnivorous space plant who I first nourished with droplets of my own blood – we’d be feeding her hobo parts by now. The project has become bigger than I ever imagined, but how beautiful she sings. On April 8th the BETA will be released and the gaming world will get its first real look. We hope to see you there. Meanwhile, here are some of the current happenings you can get behind: For the next week we’ll be holding a drawing for a free boxed version of Crystal Catacombs and a T-shirt. All you have to do to enter is like Crystal Catacombs on Facebook . If you’d like , you can also follow us on Twitter and/or Instagram . I'm sure you guys are already aware of how absolutely crucial word of mouth is for any indie project. Also, I’m currently running a pretty nice boxed NES/collection EBay auction to help with my personal funds. Did you know you can melt peanut butter over pan fried ramen noodles to make an excellent 'Poor Man’s Pad Thai'? Anyways, I consider this another sacrifice to the time and resource gods, if you will. If you have any questions regarding Catacombs or this post (whatever, really) please feel free to contact me directly at <email> As always, thank you for your continuing support. You’re all beautiful people. ~ Keep an eye out for the new LevelsorLives.com next month too! Crystal Catacombs’ approximate release date is for July 31st, 2013 (PC, Mac and Linux via Digital Download). Depending on the outcome of the initial release, further platform ports are still very possible. The BETA will be released on April 8th and will most likely be available for about a month’s time. If you would like to be a part of the BETA (it should be a lot of fun!) you can still upgrade your rewards tier by paying towards the $50 Beta Tester tier. This can be done by donating through PayPal via LevelsorLives.com . While I’m on the subject - the website is currently in the process of being upgraded for a more user friendly experience. I’ll keep you posted. Levels or Lives has officially partnered up with Super Fun Games to help bring Crystal Catacombs to the next level and the development is really beginning to pick up momentum. I don’t want to divulge too much concerning the development progress but I can tell you that the game is definitely moving in the right direction… The last build I saw made me very, very happy. Good things are happening! Ideally, I’d like to get everyone’s boxed versions, t-shirts, prints and the rest of the rewards mailed out at the same time – which means that it will most likely be towards the actual release date. I’ll contact each reward tier with mailing details/requests towards the end of the year. I want to make sure that this stuff is something you guys will be able to enjoy. As always, thank you for your continuing support! -Maxwell Hey everyone! I've posted some new enemy screenshots, artwork and music over at the Levels or Lives Blogspot page. I'm also planning on doing a bigger Halloween update that covers some info on approximate dates, details on the Beta/development and of course - your rewards! :D Hello everyone, I wanted to let you all know that we've finished the first version of the Levels or Lives website. Along with Facebook and Twitter, it should act as a good source for new info pertaining to Crystal Catacombs. If you haven't already, you can also pre-order a copy of the game from the site! As we push forward with development, I'll make sure to keep everyone updated! Cheers! -Maxwell When I was young, I loved to draw mazes on paper. Scattered throughout the little graphite and ball-point pen constructed hallways were scary monsters, magical weapons and helpful tools (say, if you found the hammer, you could create a shortcut by erasing a section of the 'wall', kinda thing). Whatever neural pathways were forged into my small, developing brain by this manner of thinking... Have clearly not changed. In fact, they've become a leading source of inspiration in the pursuit of my own creativity, as well as my everyday life. Over a year ago I began work on what is now Crystal Catacombs. An ambitious project that is a direct result of my passion for exploring creativity, the video games I've come to love and the art of creating something real from a single idea. Now, over 800 people from all over the world have come together to support Crystal Catacombs. I can't really express my gratitude for how much you've helped out... but I can say thank you. Thank you so much for helping to create this game. I am REALLY excited to share this with all of you. I believe that when you truly fall in love with an idea, run with it - YOU have proven this. Thank you Well friends, we’ve reached the 15k extended goal which means - we’ll be including a Map Editor into Crystal Catacombs!! Whoooooooooo! I can’t wait to see what kinda cuh-razy lavals you guys come up with!! :D Has it been a month already? Woah. As we draw ever closer to the funding deadline, I’d like to take a moment and thank everyone here on Earth who has helped us out. Along with all of you beautiful backers, we’ve had a show of support from some really great publications as well. These guys rock: GameZebo Rock, Paper, Shotgun Game Informer Indie Games.com DIYGamer The Indie Game Magazine Aaaaaand of course, Kickstarter! If I’ve forgotten anyone – I love you too. If you guys know of anyone who you think might enjoy this game, by all means, please tell them about it! 24 hours to go! I’ll be sending you guys another update tomorrow afternoon once the funding crosses the finish line!! A big ol' thanks from Levels or Lives (and Jack the cat)! Solo, Boxed Version of Crystal Catacombs Now Available! Due to popular demand, we've created a new $125 tier that includes a boxed version of the game and instruction manual! Check out the pledge for more details. Beta Testing! I'm happy to announce that we're shooting for an early fall release for the beta testing phase! If you haven't already signed up, It's not too late to join in and be one of the first people to play Crystal Catacombs! The Official Levels or Lives Website! We're working on a new site! Once it's all polished, the official Levels or Lives internet webpage will act as our new base of operations. Expect lots of features including news, artwork, updates and more! We're aiming for it to be up and running right as the Kickstarter project finishes up. In the meantime, you can always check out our Update Page! A lot can happen in a week... Last but not even close to least, I just have to thank all you again for showing your support for Crystal Catacombs. You're making this possible! We have about a week left, so... Help spread the word and lets see just how far we can take it!! -Maxwell <url>"failure". As far as updates go, I would suggest reading through the August 16th KS update/check out the latest Developer Video. When there is something news worthy to report, I'll release a new update. @Octo, the best way to keep up with the current happenings is to follow Crystal Catacombs over on Facebook. I don't usually post here on Kickstarter unless announcing bigger news (which yes, I do plan on - sometime soon) Overall, development is moving forward. Every new build of the game is a small step forward! Stay tuned. The 'once was Halloween Update' should be posted by Friday evening. Release dates! Hey guys, I've recently been working on compiling a nice, new update for everyone. It should cover a lot of questions. In spirit, eh? I'd say everyone who entered won because I'm actually using some of your suggestions for inspiration. Thanks Nicholas! I think Steam is doing something that a lot of indie game developers are going to appreciate. I'm definitely planning on trying to get Crystal Catacombs involved with Greenlight. Side note: We're working on getting the official website up and running! From there, you can follow on the development of the project and pre-order the game as well. I'll keep everyone posted here on Kickstarter! We might just hit that map editor yet... A big thanks to everyone who has entered into the realm design contest! I've seen some really good entries! Even if we don't hit that goal, you might just want to keep a close eye out when you sit down to play CC... Maybe one of your ideas might show up. ~Vercoln, I think we can make an exception for major power outages :) I can't wait to see your entry! Veav ~ I sure did. Love the old references! Hey friends, just curious... Are you guys planning on participating in the Realm Design Contest? I can't wait to see what you come up with! To answer both of your questions: We've been hitting as many sites as possible. I've personally reached out to Kotaku a few times and am hoping to hear back from them. They helped us out a ton last year. Goooooaaaaaallllll! Amy, you were SO close... one minute before you pledged, my buddy Dave pledged the last $15! You're all winners in my book! Who's going to be the one to cross the goal line?! Photo finish! Norm ~ Unlockable characters are always fun but unless I was to sell my solid gold house and my rocket car... I doubt Nintendo or Konami would relinquish those rights. Devon - You might just be in luck. Check out the Crystal Realm Design Contest for details on how you could win a boxed version of the game... and something even coooooler. Good question Xiru -. Upon death, you'll be able to revert to your last save point. There are two ways to save your game - one would be by using the save point inside Vasil's airship, the second would be by entering a Save Chamber, which can be found randomly located throughout the Crystal Realms. 6K! Thanks 220th backer! :D Also... Friends from The United Kingdom (Southampton, Southport), Paris, Germany, Moscow, Barcelona, Athens, Israel, Budapest, Stockholm, Norway, the Netherlands, Finland, Australia (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth), New Zealand, Brazil, Canada (Vancouver, Toronto, Nelson, Penticton, Saskatoon, Calgary, Georgetown) and dozens of cities here in the states have all shown their support for Crystal Catacombs. THANK YOU PLANET EARTH!! Thank you! It's great to see so many veteran backers returning to show support again! ~77%!!~ Hey everyone! Thank you all for the awesome support. The funding is going really well so far AND we've still got 27 days left! ...I'm stoked. :D Brad ~ We'd love to port Crystal Catacombs to as many platforms (Linux too!) as possible! The different platform versions of the game will most likely be determined by how well the fundraising goes. The better the outcome, the better chance for more platforms! Matt ~ I completely agree with you regarding the indie games platform on Live. Our goal was to shoot for XBLA first, but if this were not possible, we'd gladly focus our attention on the indie games section. This first week is going great, lets keep it up! -Maxwell Hi, I see there are only 18 reviews on Steam, and I sincerely doubt any backers here will have bought it there a second time. Any chance of sending us free keys, as many of us will use Steam as our primary game distribution platform? Might help getting more reviews in for the game! Congratulations with getting the game on Steam! (<url>"I'll also be posting daily updates concerning all kinds of fun aspects about the game. DAILY UPDATES!" I get that this wasn't feasible, but not even bi-monthly updates? Any news/updates? :-) Woulden't mind an update Coming from another kickstarter that is a failure and asked for a refund, I'm really hoping this guy isn't doing the same shit cuase I'd hate to ask for a refund on 2 kickstarter projects in a matter of minutes... So Maxwell, bud, please give an update thank you. I just read the update, and I'd like to ask that you talk about what this means for the original backers of the game. If us original backers don't back on indie go-go, what does that mean for our original backing? Will we still get the full game? Or will we only get a partially complete game? The update isn't clear enough. Thanks! Well, seeing you finally came out of hiding, I feel like I should have asked for an update much much much earlier... :-( So you planned to announce "bigger news" on April 7. I'm guessing that was about the BETA? How about an update to tell us what went wrong and/or delayed everything? Any updates??? An update would be nice. Do we have an ETA? Hello, any news on the game? I haven't checked in lately. I don't have facebook. is there a link I can get to it? @Maxwell Heya! I don't do Facebook so I don't have an account. Any updates? Many thanks, looking forward to playing. So it's been quite awhile, I haven't heard anything. The website seems kinda dead. Whats up? Any info on the game? Now we are in the new year, how is Crystal Catacombs coming along? +1 for update - and who won the contest? (In spirit?) Hi guys. Just checking in to see how the game is coming along. We would love to see a new update added! Thanks. :) Thinking about distribution, Steam just announced Greenlight which is a way to get your game onto Steam using the community website. Sounds like it's launching in August but might be a good idea to get ready for it (unless you already some sort of talks in place). Website is here (<url>´s go for it! I noticed you mentioned that you'd like to port to XBLA, if possible. It's worth mentioning that Xbox has the XNA Indie Games platform, which is much easier to get into, and get your game on the Xbox platform. I love procedural generation in games! Backing this because I want to see more games that use procedural techniques. We need this game to come alive! Good luck! Can't wait :) Good stuff Maxwell. I can tell you put a lot of work into it. Awesome! Can't wait :) Go Max, Go!!!! Been waiting for this one to come back. Now it's time to get the word out and get this backed. Just wish the Pitch video was more of the game at the start of it. What sold this game to me was the amazing pixel art I hope it funds this time! I made my pledge :)
