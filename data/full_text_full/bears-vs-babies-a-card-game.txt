Bears vs Babies is a card game where you build handsome, incredible monsters who go to war with horrible, awful babies. It was created by the same people who made Exploding Kittens: Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs) and Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal). The game takes a few minutes to learn, it's kid-friendly, and each round takes about 20 minutes to play. (Stretch Goals here!) THE ORIGIN STORY I’ve always wanted to make a card game. A few years ago, I started working on a game based on my comic, The Oatmeal, where you connect heads, torsos, arms, and legs to create a variety of monsters based on characters from my comic, such as the Bear-O-Dactyl. The original version of this game was doodled onto paper cutouts, and had no functioning game mechanic other than “build funny-looking things.” The very first version of the Oatmeal card game. Two years ago I met Elan Lee, and he showed me a prototype of a game called “BombSquad,” which we renamed to Exploding Kittens. After Exploding Kittens launched, my creature-building game got put on hold. After the dust from Exploding Kittens eventually settled, I asked Elan to help with the design of my monster-building game. I didn’t want this to be one of those games where you're trying to "out-comedy" one another; I wanted it to be more of a deck-building game, such as Dominion or Hearthstone, but without all the complexity. I wanted a monster-building game you could easily play at a party. Up until this point, my version of the game had a big problem: when you played, you were on autopilot. You had no decisions to make and usually one correct action to perform on every turn. Elan has been designing physical and digital games for most of his career (he invented the genre of alternate reality games, and was formerly the creative director of the Xbox), so he put his gargantuan puzzle-solving brain to work and added a layer of much-needed complexity to the game. He tinkered a bunch and established the basic rules of conflict, construction, and the escalation mechanic that would define the core gameplay. The tricky part was keeping this simple enough to be a party game, but complicated enough to allow for depth and strategy. It’s easy to fall into two bad categories when designing tabletop games: either they’re easy to learn but completely random, or they’re very strategic but mind-numbingly boring. You have to walk a very thin line between the two. I think with Bears vs Babies we did that. Our battle-hardened "Sharpie Deck" After months of pestering everyone we knew to play the game with us and tweaking the rules bit by bit, we finally got it to the point where our friends pestered us to play, instead of vice versa. And that eventually brought us here, to Kickstarter, where we’re now pestering the whole internet to play with us. And so here we are. Let the bear hugs and baby burping begin. -Matt and Elan ---------- ---------- Press Inquiries Email: <email> ---------- Hi there. It's us, your best buddies over at Exploding Kittens.

Sign up here and we'll send you an email when the game is available to the public. FAQ I don't see an email from Blackbox. What do I do?

We're currently about 5 thousand backers away from being the #2 most backed game on Kickstarter EVER. Are you up for helping us hit a milestone? Do you like crushing the competition? Do you know five thousand people? Thing #2: We'll be doing a livestream tonight to countdown the final two hours of the campaign. Matt (The Oatmeal) will be drawing cards based on your suggestions, and Elan will be answering questions about the game. Thing #3: During the livestream, we'll announce the winner of the Real Bear Naming Contest in which you named a real bear forever and ever. Those are all the things. --- See you tonight RIGHT HERE from 4pm to 6pm PST. Prepping for hibernation, The Bears vs Babies Team We’re working with the amazing people at Forest Animal Rescue, and they’ve asked us if we’d like to give a name to one of their new arrivals. We thought we’d offer up that privilege to some of our favorite people: YOU Here are the names you've come up with: Beary McBearface Oatmeal Harambear Lady Bearington (that last one didn't get as many nominations as the others, but was voted in by the Bears vs Babies Team.) --- TO VOTE If you're reading this in email, click "Comment on Kickstarter" at the bottom of this mail and cast your vote in the comments section of the update. If you're reading it anywhere else, just leave your comments at the bottom of this page. We will only count 1 vote per backer, and your vote must be for one of the four options listed above. Voting will close Thursday, Nov 17th at 11am PST. Let's name a bear! The Bears vs Babies Team Nearly 30 days ago, we introduced our new game to you. We hoped you'd like it, that you'd play it with us, but most of all, we hoped that you'd spend the next month laughing with us. And you did. You took pictures, you wrote songs, and you invented monsters... Along the way you've upgraded the game to include even more awesomeness: And now with just a few hours left in the campaign, you've unlocked something that's never been done before: Covering the box in fur forced us to rethink the manufacturing process. What kind of fur should we use? How can you print on fur? Can you shrink wrap it? Will the glue smell bad? Will the fur get squished during shipping? Will the box shed? We've been working with the best manufacturers in the world to answer these questions because no one on the planet has ever had to answer them. This is our gift to you. Thank you for giving our new game a home. --- That's it! All that's left is to celebrate this victory! Tomorrow we'll be hosting a livestream countdown to the end of the campaign. Matt (The Oatmeal) will be drawing cards based on your suggestions and Elan will be answering any questions you have. We'll also be announcing the name of the real bear you voted for!

Can you please email <email> with your backer number / backer email so we can get your rewards sent right out? Hi there! Please send an email to <email> and we'll get you sorted! Hey Deserie - please email us at <email> and we'll help you out. Sorry to hear your game was lost! @Sammy, Katya, Jeremy, and Prav - Sorry to hear about this! Please reach out directly to our support team at <email> and they'll help you out. @Tomas - Hey there! You should definitely have the game by now. Could you please email us at <email> so we can further look into this? @Alvin - Sorry to hear that! Please email us at <email> and we'll help track down your game. @Buzatu-Teodorescu Ada - Hi Buzatu-Teodorescu, so sorry to hear that! We'll have our support team reach out to you within the next hour. @Mark Dowman Hi Mark - so sorry to hear what you've been through! We can definitely help out here. Please email us at <email> so we can get all of your information. @Kenny Hey Kenny! So sorry to hear that. We'll look into this and get back to you today. @smuu unfortunately the games that shipped from the UK distribution center had an issue with importing the new BvB comic so they defaulted back to the EK one. It was one of those things were we didn't want to hold up shipping any longer to fix it, so we prioritized speed! @macstanislaus Baby Infantries were clearly the better name. They were the name that made it all the way through to our final round of playtesting. But then we started getting feedback that it was confusing to have both ARMIES and INFANTRIES in the same game, so we changed it for the final production run. Plus, we hate babies and don't want them to have nice things. @S.Yobas In that case, it's a bounce! All monsters and babies stay on the board, and the provoke action was wasted. For more answers check out the FAQ that came in the box. Hope you're having fun! @Mark. Yup! accessories are considered part of a monster and are dealt with in all the same ways. (discarding, dumpster diving, etc.) @Colin if you get a wild provoke in your initial hand, shuffle it back into the draw pile and grab a new card. (check out the FAQ in the box for more details.) Glad you're enjoying the game! @Eunice Keep in mind you're fighting against all the other player's monsters (of the same type) as well. Powerful monsters = crushing your opponents! @BrianCampbell Wild Provoke means you must play it immediately as an action on your turn. If you swap and get a mask, you are allowed to look at the head your received. For answers to these questions and more, see the FAQ that came in the box. Enjoy! @Mitchell Yup, you got it right. Cards are played as individual moves on your turn, so you can play them at the most strategic time possible. @Thom, yes putting the rainbow stripes on the sides of the Bear Head cards is by design. We know it makes it easier to see the cards, but it also makes it easier to find the Bear Heads when you're setting up the game and each player must start with one. In playtesting, we found that the faster start time outweighed the slight advantage of being able to determine where an additional bear head was in the draw pile. Hope this helps clarify! @RobinBergenstråhle - email <email> and they can triple check your order! @Marc - check out the FAQ...under the provoke section - "If you are dealt a Provoke Card as part of your starting hand, shuffle it back into any Draw Pile and draw another card." @Patrick, agreed. We're working on one as I type! (will probably send it out sometime next week) @Gavin, that's horrible! please write to <email> and we'll get you a new deck immediately! @Stephen, I was skeptical as well. I have the shipping receipts for more than 1000 packages that left the plant today. So unless I scared them enough that they'd engage in large scale forgery, I think we're good. I'll have another update tomorrow, and I'll just keep cracking the whip every day until all orders are delivered! UK/EU UPDATE - yelling successful. Shipping in the UK and Europe has officially started. Expect your notifications soon, and a box in the mail. The plant knows this delay is completely unacceptable and will be working non-stop. Really appreciate your understanding. For a series of complicated/frustrating reasons, EVERYTHING in our UK/EU distribution plant is taking longer than they promised. I’ve spent the day in a series of yelling/threatening conversations to correct this. One way or another I’ll have a full update for everyone on Monday. I’m really sorry this sucks so bad, and really appreciate your patience. So thrilled to hear that you're all having so much fun with the box and the game. Thanks for the amazing words of encouragement! UK/EU update: All crates have arrived at our UK distribution center and will start shipping out to all of Europe tomorrow. Check your inboxes for your shipping confirmation! @Stephen, we've just heard that there is some sort of hold up in the UK distribution plant. Getting on the phone with them ASAP to get you an update. Really sorry for the delay, but I promise I'll get it sorted! @Megan, check out the first question in the FAQ that came with the game. Should get you all sorted! @Sabrina sounds like a glitch! Write us at <email> and we'll fix it immediately! @Mercurius, Excellent observation. The game was originally designed as a three person game, and then we filled in the cracks from there to make it work with 2, 4, and 5 players. It's always a challenge to balance a non-digital game with a variable number of players, because very few things can be adjusted without making things crazy complicated...but we did our best :) @Warren, so sorry about that! Not sure what went wrong, but we'll get it fixed immediately. Can you write to <email> and we'll get all your info? Again, really sorry about the glitch! @thomas NOPE. You can only build your own monsters. @Reyom Absolutely. For now, we're still pushing boxes out the door every single day so don't worry just yet! @Dislex thanks so much!! @D Ok, good to hear. Guess you just got a bonus card. If you draw something amazing on it, be sure to show us :) @D. Seems like something went wrong there! Please write us at <email> so we can figure out what went wrong and make sure you get a complete game! @christopher It's always nerve wracking to work so hard on a new creation and then put it out in the world to see how it does on its own. Your words really keep me going....THANK YOU!! @Mercurius FWIW, we inserted the rainbow lines to make it simple to locate the bear heads in the deck and start playing. (because each player needs one to start) Turning all heads upside down beneath a mask solves the problem you're describing. Hope this helps! @Derek, I understand your frustration, but I want to be clear that it's not the case that international orders have to wait until after the US ships. With this many backers, we have to use multiple freight ships to bring the cards into the various ports for local distribution. The ships coming into the US simply arrived first. All ships have now arrived though and all international orders and the remaining US orders are all being distributed simultaneously. Hope this helps clarify! @John UK delivery starts this week! @Abu I suddenly feel icky.... Thanks @David. We really are working around the clock to get all the orders out. We also reply to absolutely every mail sent to <email>. If you didn't get a quick reply, please check your junk mail folder. Thank you everyone! @thanks Jonathan. Ok, I'm on it... Thank you @Paul! We're working around the clock and praise like that helps the whole team get through it! @Jonathan, really really sorry you feel that way. I personally sincerely apologize. It was never our intention to mislead you...just to try to keep shipping out the boxes as quickly as the realities of this project allowed and to celebrate the start of that process. I completely understand why you feel the way you do, and am so sorry we disappointed you. I hope that when you receive the game you see how much love went into it, and it makes up for (in a small way) the frustration you feel. Again, really sorry. @Del. In that particular case of a tie, it's a bounce. All monsters and babies stay on the board. @Brian, I hear you. We should have been doing a better job at keeping up with the Kickstarter comments. We'll be in here every day for the next little while to make sure we do a better job. (as I'm sure you can imagine, getting this package out the door has been quite an ordeal...not an excuse, just letting you know that we haven't been vacationing :) Keep the comments coming and we'll try to get to all of them. If we miss your comment because of the lack of threading here, just write us an email at <email> MUCH THANKS!! Sorry for the prolonged silence everyone. We hope today's updates makes up for it. Someday I'll tell you all the story about how when you try to ship a box covered in fur, you have to arrange private meetings with the shipping companies to alleviate their "shedding concerns". Hey guys! We are working on an update for you now, and we'll hopefully have it up by the end of next week. If you have any questions about your orders or just want to say hi, please email us at <email>! Our team would love to hear from you. @Daniel Brady. YUP! We'll let you add more games to your order and will honor the Kickstarter price during the (definitely not a) survey. Hello everyone! To be clear, we have NOT yet sent out a survey. We're actually trying our hardest to avoid using the word "survey" as it's really ambiguous and confusing. (none of us are even sure where it came from or why it caught on.) On April 3rd, we'll ask everyone to confirm their mailing addresses and final order details using backerkit. Thank you! AND VOTING IS OFFICIALLY CLOSED!!! (We'll tally up the votes and announce the winning bear name tonight during the livestream right here on this page from 4 to 6pm PST) Thank you guys for voting! Good morning! Really excited to talk to you guys on the livestream this afternoon, but until then I have a personal project that I could use your help to accomplish. Double Fine Adventure (<url>#3 announced! You guys are three achievements away from having EVERY BOX COVERED IN FUR! also, just for you guys some back channel info: we're currently building a live stream for the final two hours of the campaign. Matt will be drawing cards and suggestions in real time based on your comments, and I'll be answering questions about the campaign and about the game. All of this will be live streamed on this Kickstarter page. We will probably start at 4pm PST on Thursday and go for two hours until the campaign ends at 6. @'Hibernating Cub' Thanks so much for saying that! This has been such a huge amount of work, and today Kickstarter changed our time remaining from days to hours so I'm a big ball of stress. Reading messages like that make it all worth while! Good morning guys! You're so close to the mystery stretch goal...only three more achievements! (this is me wearing my pom poms) I think everything on both pages should be up to date now! @tanguy, NOPE! Gotta be in the same pic! @Justin, I'll take a look. Thanks for alerting me! Hey guys, sorry for the delay in updating the achievements. Paul, our designer who maintains the page has a horrible flu. We're pumping him full of orange juice and vitamins and will try to prop him up for long enough to update the graphics. Really sorry about this, but we appreciate your patience! Hey guys, Matt and I will be doing a live stream tomorrow morning at 11am PST <url>"print and play" rules idea. I'm really excited to get the rules and prototype decks into your hands ASAP. That's exactly the plan after the campaign when we have our final list of backers. We'll be sending early versions of the game to a few hundred playtest parties to show you what we've got, ask some questions, and get your help with the final touches. (rules for hosting parties will be posted after the campaign) I'm really proud of this game. We build and test it every night, and it continues to improve. It's fun and funny and has amazing strategy. But I still think it can be better. That's what we'll need your help with...in fact, that's the whole reason we're here instead of putting this straight onto store shelves. @jenna just saw it! Thats awesome, and congratulations! You unlocked a goal. @jenna we've seen the little sculptures, haven't seen the 7ft monster. Send us a link on facebook and we'll get it counted. Okay guys, count update: We're basing this on singular entries--so multiple photos of the same thing in a different pose do not count. We've counted 13 cat fighter jets, 1 baby tank, 2 pumpkins, 2 food shares, 12 babies as bears, 2 beard babies, and 7 Pomeranians. Ashley is sifting through the sculptures now, and its not at 25 yet, but she will have that exact number for you in the morning. Keep up the good work guys! @Tom I'll get the numbers from Ashley as soon as she's done counting. Our social media person, Ashley, is handling all of the counting. She says hi and thanks for all your hard work keeping track of everything. Heads up: You're three away from unlocking the Pomeranian achievement. Hey guys, sorry to be so silent over here. We've kept her heads down and have been busily building this campaign. I'll try to hop on here from time to time to answer any questions you have, so keep them coming, and thank you for all of your support! Hi guys! First of all....THANK YOU!!! We're all walking around in a daze at the office at the incredible number of people that showed up to support us! You guys are the bestest! We're building the next big update that will include stretch goals, achievements and the beginning of a month long party. Early next week! Stay tuned! Hey guys, we'll be announcing this officially, but we just added South Africa to the list of countries we will ship to! @Max you're so impatient! We have big plans, I promise. This is going to be a fun party, so for now just enjoy the day :) @Geist, ya no signed editions this time. We'll happily sign them at conferences or if you just come visit us, but we've had enough of those horrible weekends were we all forget how to be human and turn into signing machines. :( @Owen, there's one more twist that we didn't talk about in the video. There are three types of babies, and three types of creatures. Babies only attack their same type of creature, so you can build up one of your armies while fighting the others. @Owen so rad to see you guys back! Although will you need a new name this time? Or is Kitten Corps cross denominational? @TJ When the babies are provoked, they attack ALL creatures on the table. So you'd better make sure you've got a strong fighting army of wonderful creatures before playing that card! Hi guys! Quick note to say thank you thank you thank you for helping us bring this to life with such enthusiasm in the first few hours! There are of course WAY too many questions in here for me to respond to each one, but I'll do my best to answer the few that jump to the top. We're also planning all kinds of fun stuff in the days ahead so hold on tight! Still haven't received the game. :/ during your recent ama you mentioned bvb expansions, can you give us a little more info?? <url>’m from Chile, has anyone from South America got the game already?, cause i still don’t have it in my hands, is there any way to track the order?? Hi. I'm backer no.6,573. I have yet to receive my pledge until today. Would you mind to help me check and update me? Thanks @Jose and Daniel - We've followed up with both of you directly via private email. Please get back to our support team and they'll work on getting this resolved for you. Thanks for your patience! Hello from spain, I have no news from my game and i have seen it in local stores for several months... Any spaniard in the same situation? Thx I have waiting 100 days since the first order was sended and 48 since the backup order was sended and i don't receive anything yet i asked to the local postal service, but they don't provide any info because i don't have a tracking number i asked on chilean tabletop groups if any recevied their orders without any luck And finally, today i noticed that a local store are selling Bears vs Babies <url>ú,Bolivia, Brazil If any backer of these countries have received their copies @Rachel - Sorry you have yet to receive your game! We'll look into this and reach out to you directly via email. @Daniel - Hi Daniel! Yes, backers from South Africa should have received their orders by now. Hey Guys, I still haven't gotten my copy yet. I got the email saying it was shipped on the 25th of July, so I kept an eye on the tracking number and it got as far as Toronto. Then it said returned to sender, it also said someone named Matt A had signed for it. @Witt for me there is no need to send to support an email, i just want to know the the status of another backers on countries near to mine Do you know about that? Can you tell to all of us? @ Alex, Esteban, and Daniel - So sorry to hear about the delay in delivery! Could you please email us at <email> so we can further investigate on our end? Does somebody of southamerica who has received the game? And I'm still waiting for my game T_T So now I can buy the game at Target international website and it would be delivered in a week and it would be cheaper than my pledge =( Still waiting to be contacted about redelivery, after mine was sent to the wrong address. Should have been returned to sender a while ago now. Any idea when I can expect to hear about this? This is just my opinion about it. One of the less interesting game I have ever played. Sorry to say this but they have taken over the (deserved) success made with Exploding Kittens, which was tons of fun literally, and came out with a project which is simply "anonymous" in gameplay, not funny nor either strategic, and that does not offer any replayable value. This time the crazy concept and hilarious arts (not that hilarious actually) did not worth a penny. One positive thing: the furry game box is extremely nice, apart from that I go back to play Exploding Kittens. @Jin, Craig, Daniel, and David - So sorry for the shipping confusion! Our support team will reach out to each of you directly within the next hour. Contact me please. I never recieved anything. i think the same of craig actually i waiting the arrive of my seccond shipped package, the first never arrive to my home. The previus proyect of elan, Exploding Kittens, their shipping was administrated by blackbox too, but in this time, the packages was shipped with tracking number. why BvsB no? actually for me, it's more easy (and probably faster and cheaper) buy a copy of this game by a reseller on ebay Hi all, i think the overall problem here is that untracked postal services were used. For example, me and another friend at the office both ordered the game and paid $25 dollar for shipping. Both of our packages were shipped on the same day(29 July) via Royal Mail to the same work address. My package never arrived, were his did. I have since worked with the support teams at both bearsvsbabies and blackbox, and a replacement was shipped via fedex, which has proper shipping and tracking and will be receiving that replacement within the next few days. What we noticed with my friends package is that the shipping cost was only 3.80 pounds (roughly $5). What was the purpose of paying roughly 5 times for shipping that never got used. Where did the extra $20 usd go. Or is that now being used to fund replacement packages? Hi Elan could the support team help me out? I received an e-mail early august saying that my parcel has shipped but up until now nothing has arrived. I checked my details and I've filled in everything correctly. I didn't yet get my game :( it was shipper in the beginning of August and then again in the beginning of September and nothing :( I'm not quite sure what to do anymore @Esteban - Hi Esteban! So sorry for the confusion. I took a look into your account, and it appears our Support team needs a little more information from your end. Please get back to them and we'll get this resolved for you as soon as we can! I know you are out there and did not see this just like me. So if you love some board game nights but hate to have to remember all the rules you have to check this out. <url>�� . oh well, at least i received the gsme, ill leave it at that. @Gonzalo Lara, the nsfw come in a separate booster After A LOT of troubles, my replacement copy of the game arrived in its furrry glory. Just one question: where is the NSFW cards, o how to recognize them? are in pack one or two? @Anne after playtesting we realized we actually didn't need that many cards--they made the game unbalanced, so we got rid of them and added a playmat to the game instead. @Samantha would you mind emailing us at <email>? The furry box should actually be five dollars more than the Kickstarter, so if it's less than that our production team needs to speak with Target. As for it being on the shelves, we waited until US shipping was complete before going to Target, but we completely understand your frustration. Our backers mean a lot to us, and none of those target buyers get the special backer bear-o-dactyl card ;) I also received the game and after couple of games I have to admit that the game itself is a major let down. Package is furrytastic and graphic design is nice, but the game is boring. It lacks depth, finess and something that would made you be interested of the game. I wasn't expecting super tactical card game, but now even Uno is more thrilling. So Elan, I thought we were getting 112 cards? I'm seeing updates that the goal was unlocked but nothing that it wasn't going to be delivered? Can you please advise? Played for the first time today.... nice game! I've received my missing package! Thank you very much! good job guys! Very disappointed to see that Target had the game for sale before y'all had finished shipping. Now adding insult to injury, Target is selling the furry box version, for $5 less. What's the point of supporting you on KS? @Jing Seow - Yikes! That doesn't sound right. Could you please email us at <email> so we can loop in our fulfillment company and further investigate? Then again, friend beside me just said perhaps it's just regarded to regulations in Singapore, and mine might just be an unlucky sampled box. :p Mine came with the booster pack already torn open, and (funny to say this but) the condoms are not there. o.o Is it just me? @Charles - Hi Charles! Sorry to hear you have yet to receive your game. Please email us at <email> and we'll check on the status of your order. I have not yet received my copy of the game, any idea why? I thought the stretch goals we unlocked were Kickstarter exclusives. Unless only specific campaigns do that. I saw Bears vs Babies at Target last night and it was furry. Makes my box less exclusive as a backer :( @Murat @Kenny Hey there! Sorry for the confusion. It looks like the support team needs a bit more information from your end - please let me know if you didn't receive our email response. Still didn't see my game appear. Support reply the item is shipped and pass the ball to black box. sigh.. Do you need any further information from my side? Thank you for looking into this topic! @Murat - Hey Murat! Sorry to hear this. We'll look into your account and get back to you today. My pledge was sent about one month ago. After initial contact with the support (and one reply) I got no answers to the following 2 mails. Could you please reply? I really want to play this awesome game but without the game itself it will be very difficult :( Help! Hurricane Harvey came and drown both the Bears and the Babies! NOoooooooo! The waters came in the house and took my copy of Bears vs. Babies deep into the swamp/sewage water. The brown fur on the box was even browner. We lost most of our stuff, but Bears vs Babies was singled out by the waters! I just know it. I think Harvey hated Bears vs. Babies, whereas my Exploding Kittens are still quite ready to explode. I reach out to you for help. I wish to battle Bears & Babies again! Is there a 'holy crap we got slapped around by a freakin' hurricane' discount on a new copy? @George Bozikas Hi George! Thanks for reaching out to the Support team. I'll touch base with them now and make sure your case is being addressed. If I want resending to UK. How long does it take for shipping to UK address ? The cards look gorgeous and the packaging is unique, but the gameplay is kinda boring, especially compared to Exploding Kittens. Are there alternative or improved rules to make it more fun? Me too. I have e-mailed support about my missing order about a week ago but received no response. backer #79,597 filled in survey form get no box deliver and emailed support and get no feedback. Received my box a few weeks ago in France. The game is gorgeous. Had a really nice first game with some friends and we're looking further to master the game. However I am so disappointed. Now that I have received my box this kickstarter campaign is over :( It was a really well managed one ! Loved your updates and even the game packaging with its mail was perfect. Best kickstarter i ever pledged for ! @David Ben - Hi David! Sorry to hear that. Please email us at <email> and we'll look into this. Hi, I got an email from Black box on August 2nd that my shipment is off, but I still did not get the box. Any way to check the status of the shipment? Thanks! @Māris Jurgenbergs You got it: Most Baby Cards! If you have additional questions, please feel free to direct them to our Support Team - <email> Not sure if i missed, but what happens, if at the end of the game 2 players have the same amount of points? How is the winner decided? Most baby cards? Highest amount of highest baby value (3 etc) cards? @Witt Godden: Awesome, thanks a lot! @Jonathan Barreaux Thanks for reaching out to the Support team. I'll reach out to them and make sure your case is being addressed! Hey guys! I've also sent an email to <email> after your last update, regarding my package not being arrived yet here in the Netherlands, but I haven't heard anything back since then. I suppose I can try Witt's advice and simply send another email, but I also thought I would let you know here, just to be on the safe side. Cheers, Jonathan @Frederique Heyerick we're sorry to hear that you've been having trouble reaching the BVB Support team. I've passed your inquiry to them personally, but if you could please try shooting them another email, it'd be a huge help in keeping track of your issue and continuing our interface! Thank you! When will there be more expansion packs? MUST HAVE!!!!! DROOOOOOOOOOL Hey guys I've sent an email to <email> letting you know I haven't received my copy yet. But the mail couldn't be delivered for some reason. So I try it this way... Kind regards Frederique from Belgium Just picked up my games yesterday here in Romania - Easter Europe. The game is absolutely fantastic! Thanks a lot it is great fun and congratulations to the team. Thanks also for the fact that my girlfriend stopped talking to me for two full days after I won three games in a row ! (she did the same once, I swapped 3 defuse to ask and get her last defuse and therefor win the game at exploding kitten !) Well done guys ;) I'm loving it :D I have to say I was sceptical at first but this is the silliest and bestest game I've played for a loooong time. I like silly and laughter. There was much to be had at the first time of asking and we've not been a night without playing for the past week... What's next?? Loving this game. It's wonderful. Would like to see the bear v baby comic instead of the cat one, but yeah...this game is quick to learn, and great fun. Where is the best place to review it for you? Game received and it looks awesome, can't wait to play it! Thanks. Just curious though: I checked an un-boxing video in youtube beforehand and noticed that there was this cool small comic with the game but mine seemed to be the same from exploding kittens. Is this something to do with the UK shipping? Thanks! I've received my missing package! Thank you very much! you're awesome ! Finally got my copy as well. The NSFW expansion is really NSFW this time. It felt more innocent and kinda cute in the Kittens but here it's all dicks, poop and tits. Well, I got exactly what I ordered :) Looking forward to playing it for the first time. It arrived today in Okinawa, Japan! Can't wait to play! @macstanislaus: that is the BEST name ever! I will use that from now on. The game is literally unplayable. I was promised an answer to the question why the armies arent called infantries. I NEVER GOT AN ANSWER ITS NOT IN THE FAQ. I cant live without this information. I simply cant carry on. Look at what you have done!!! Hi guys, I didn't yet got my Bears vs Babies game. I got the blackbox mail on 2nd of august shipping from UK to Romania. Is there a way to track the orders through blackbox? I wrote an email to <email> 5 days ago and no answer. Help? OMG it's so furry. My parents were nice enough to forward the package to my new address. Can't wait to play it with friends and co workers. Thank you again for those two awesome games (Exploding Kittens and Bears vs Babies) Got in south France. Ready to party hard with it :D Thanks a lot ! Hey guys, There isn't anything in the rule book about ties between monsters. Who gets the points if for example player A has 5 strength monster Player B has also 5 strength monster and baby army has 1 point. Who gets the baby card as point ? +1 Philippines. Can't wait to play this with my son :) Has arrived in Iceland! Probably one of the coolest and most innovative Kickstarter package I have ever received! I image the game to be a fun simple experience that can be shared with non-gamers! In Finland here, just received an email yesterday saying that it's en route from the UK. Can't wait! @Witt thank you so much for the fast answer , i will write them. :) Thanks for the response Elan! Me and my 7yo daughter love this game. ✌️ @Ditsch - Hey there! Please email us at <email> and we'll look into this for you! My backerkit account says I did get it send the 2nd august it's now the 22th august so 20 days later and still nothing , not even a tracking mail. Is there a problem with some pledges not being send ? Thank you. @Jan - Sorry to hear that! I'll look into your account and have someone from our team touch base with you today. Still waiting in Czech republic. No e-mail, no game. I contacted your support and they said my game has not been shipped and I should keep waiting. Why did you posted update that everything is shipped then? :( Hello guys, I'm Jeffrey from Malaysia. Just received my parcel and am ready to rock that furry box! Question for elan: when monsters get beaten along with the accessories, do the accessories also get discarded as well in the same pile as the rest of the monster pieces? If a player decides to go do the dumpster to pick cards from the discard pile, are accessories (ie double strength hats, etc) included with those that he can pick from the discard? @Da_maniak15 - if you're missing something from your order, please let us know by emailing <email> or reaching out directly to Blackbox (they do fulfillment for us) at <email>. Either way, we will make sure you get any missing items ASAP! @CraigBoonzaier - oh no! we need to make sure you can get your copy! Email us at <email> and we'll make sure to get you some more help. @Raf Sannen, @StuartSmith, @Murat, @Pim Booij, @Fernando Aguilar, international orders are coming from the United Kingdom and may take some time to make it through customs - please email us a <email> and we can look into it for you! Are the deliveries to Belgium still ongoing? Received a Blackbox email on August 4th but still seen no copy of the game so far.. :-/ Very late reaction, received mine weeks ago. Thrilled. Tnx for the condom in the NSFW package. I'll nail it to my pinboard in case I ever need it. Disregard that, makes me look quite beta. Still, packaging is brilliant. Tnx for this nice project! Got mine! Philippines! Received mine a minute ago! Unboxing was so much fun! Thanks guys! Can't wait for your next game :D I'm from The Netherlands btw Still nothing in the Czech Republic. I submitted everything on time and still got no email notification or the game itslef. My backerkit page states that my rewards are being prepared for shipment and nothing else. I've also tried to contact the support on the email address from the latest update but i didn't get any response at all. Saw the Fuzzy box at Target along with the Party edition of Exploding Kittens. Got my Bears Vs Babies ���� Brunei/Borneo @Trueflight Silverwing; Thanks for the clarification :) I received, my shipping notification on 9th August and still not received it. Survey was completed in April. Contacted support, who forwarded to Blackbox, and I have had to resupply my details. I've got two kids here desperate to play the game (they loved exploding kittens), and can't get any details about when i'll get the game. Its gone beyond silly now. @Par Dahlgren they mentioned that there was only going to be 107 cards (not the 112) a while back in one of their updates. As for the player count, the actual game only supports 2-4 players, but the promo card that we got as Kickstarter backers allows for an additional player (bringing it up to 5 players). Normally the game only allows for 4 max though, which is why it is listed as such. WE LOVE IT. It was a bit difficult at first, but then we totally got into it. It's awesome. The cards are lovely and the drawings are hilarious. Nice that there is extra space in the box for the expansion pack. Good thinking. Received in Singapore this morning and played a few games today! Really enjoyed it, but felt like it wasn't necessary to build up the bears/monsters too much since the babies were at most only 3 points. A 16 point monster (with a hat) would beat any baby army with 4-5 cards, but you risk wasting your whole monster in one unworthy provoke. Which I thought was such a waste since the building of monsters is the fun part, but doesn't seem practical strategically. Still fun though! Maybe more expansion packs with more higher valued monsters would be great! Question on Wild Provoke cards - does "must play immediately" mean that if you draw the card as your first action you have to play it right then and lose the rest of your actions for that turn? Or can you finish your actions first? And another question regarding masks - if a head swap is used and I receive a masked head from another player, am I allowed to look at the head behind the mask? Fantastic production quality and attention to detail! Can't wait to play very soon! @StaGeD I'm not sure if this applies to every delivery, but after enquiring (NICELY), they actually gave me a tracking number for my delivery in Malaysia. I have no idea why they didn't send the tracking numbers out initially, unless maybe not all areas are provided with one. It might be worth asking nicely if they have a tracking number for yours? Well, no need to worry, 16 days after the shipping confirmation I got my copy @zain yup. I received the email on 1st of Aug. But there is no tracking capabilities for this. So I'm not really sure where is the item as well Got my shipping notification 2 weeks ago. When can I expect to get this game? (Germany) I got my box yesterday and are a bit confused: - The games was supposed to be upgraded to 112 cards but I can only find 107 - According to the KS page it's for 2-4 players, the rulebook states 2-5 And my backer card 'A Bear-o-dactyl' was warped in the middle @staGeD Did you receive an email from Blackbox that it's shipped yet? Hello! I've yet to receive my copy in Singapore! Should I start to be worried?? So I received my shipping confirmation 16 days ago, but I have not received anything. I live in The Netherlands, should I start to worry? My order of Bears Vs Babies arrived yesterday, and im not impressed. I ordered 2 base games and 2NSFW packs. My order was invoiced out as such, but only one of each was in there. The NSFW booster was unusable as the condom had leaked AND the Thank you envelope, of which I should have got two, was empty. Not very happy right now, as I have an unplayable game, missing rewards and missing exclusive kickstarter content. Anyone else have this issue? Notification received two weeks ago, not yet the package. How long should I wait? I'm from Mexico. Just got a brush off email from Blackbox, not impressed So with the KS exclusive card and the NSFW deck, how many players max can I have? 7? Was away for a week, I get back and there was a nice little package with a furry box inside waiting for me on my work desk. Everything looks great, can't wait to start playing! In France, got it. Thx a lot and thx for the gift :) How longer after the email from black box should I expect to receive it? I moved house recently and the agent is really rubbish at forwarding stuff I really love this game, so much fun to play at lunch time with colleagues. Got it 2 weeks ago, its awesome! And the furry box is a big hit with my friends. Thank you!! Can't stop playing this game! I have a question for any others that have had a chance to run through it. There have been a few instances where a player gets the wild provoke in their hand that is initially dealt. Technically there are no babies to provoke (depending on how fast people go through there hand) and no monsters built to battle. What have you done when this occurs? Received in Walsall, UK. Played tonight. My son loves it. I loved the packaging. REALLY nice and personal. Man, we are going to need a bigger table for bear building! Well done guys. Games already in public, see it at Target All that being said, everyone had a blast and had many laughs at the hilarious monsters we built. I played my copy of BvB for the first time this weekend. We had some initial confusion about the dismember and lullaby cards. Initially we thought they played at "instant speed" (as interrupts on opponent turns) but upon reflecting on it, I thought it made sense that they could only be played as actions (playing a card) on your own turn. Since we started with the other technique, everyone else immediately disagreed with me, so I figured I would post here for clarification, as it was not in the FAQ. Oh yeah. And the invoice really cracked me up. Such a clever idea :D Bill me MOAR! XD I received it and I still haven't played it BUT I'm just dropping a few lines to say that I really LOVE LOVE L-O-V-E the packaging. 1st prize for Kickstarter packaging of the year. Really, well done guys. The furry boxy smells quality and attention to details everywhere. I want more. Many thanks!!! Is there a chance that new expansion packs will be available after this kickstarter is finished? Like packs with new themes and/or abilities? FRANCE Mail reçu 11.08 colis reçu le 16.08 Received mine today ! (France) I'm disappointing, the NSFW pack is missing :( Anyway the box is great et I'm looking forward playing it! Played our first game last night! Interesting fun, need to work on my strategy! Any South Africans got their package yet. Blackbox said I should contact RoyalMail. So armed with all the details I can get from Blackbox: My Name, Order Number and Shipping Details and then eventually getting hold of a RoyalMail agent, only to get told they can't help me as I have no tracking number. All I know is that my package was shipped on 31st July. Hopefully, in future BlackBox will be able to provide tracking numbers for Non-US customers. I just opened our NSFW booster and looked like the condom wasn't packaged properly and leaked lube all over the cards. Anyone else have this problem? got mine about a week ago (austria) ... love it! it's so fluffy! My copy is furrier than imagined. Thank you! Getting a replacment copy sent to me after the whole damaged/broken/lost issue i had with the Swedish post office. No packadge to speak off so cant even verify if they are telling the truth or not, or if its plain theft. In any case Blackbox was more then accommedating and helpful so its really appriciated :-) :) <url>#50,384 Received mine today (15/7) in Malaysia. Was the best surprise I've had from Kickstarter yet! Thanks guys and all the best! @HarvardBlake & @KarelTiteca - email us at <email>! We'll be able to provide some answers for you. Got mine in Madrid today. WOW!!! It looks amazing! Thanks!!!! I see several notifications about people in Belgium that have received their game. I'm in Belgium and I even don't have a shipping confirmation yet. :-( Starting to get worried... Received in London! @Kasper thanks Jeg er også fra Danmark- fik den også 4 august - håber den ligger i postkassen :D It's a wonderful game! Lots of fun to play and build wonderful monsters. Would've liked if there was more ways to mess with your opponents armies though. Messing with other people makes Exploding Kittens such a great game, but perhaps that something to be added in version 2. I think I might just be missing the Nope card too much :) Thanks for both these great games, looking forward to more from you guys! Just got mine today in Denmark :) Very awesome job, the personalized cartoon was fucking awesome!! Got mine in Dublin today, 5 days since blackbox email @Stephan Spence.. I got my Black Box Email on the 4th of August, and havent recieved anything yet either.. I have watched alot of people from Denmark getting their copies though :( I got my blackbox notification over 1 week ago - still no game. Is that normal? I still haven't received an email or a game yet. I'm in the USA. Any updates? Received in Canada 2nd August while I was out in the UK. Everything was in order and we've played a game. NSFW pack is hilarious :) We had to hold off for a while on opening the package but FINALLY got to play, and it was even better than expected. Excellent execution, tons of fun to play, and it's currently the family favourite. (NSFW package not opened yet for that reason. :P ) Thank you! Got the game in Portugal and it looks great! Quality product as usual from you guys. additional, because someone asked: Germany: Deutsche Post Briefversand Germany: no shipping mail, but I have received my game :) Played a few games this week freaking loved by all involved. Mostly we just played who could build the craziest monster and kept forgetting to poke the babies but when we did things got heated :D Hey Elan... played the game today. Pretty fun! One oversight I noticed though is... you can see where the bear heads are in the draw decks if you look at the sides of the deck. Is this intended? Hi! How could I track my bears? :) Thanks!! Recibido en Málaga (España). Got mine today in Sheffield, UK. @Robin have you got a small envelope with Thanks written on it? A note and KS exclusive card inside. I got an apology from the Royal Mail for the state my item was in (as far as I can tell only the brown paper box, e.i. the none game-box, was damaged), but just to make sure that I got everything: 1 pcs amazing furry box 1 pcs "Packet 1" 1 pcs "Packet 2" 1 psc Playmat 1 pcs "The rules" 1 pcs "FAQ" 1 pcs personlized cartoon (which sadly can't handle all the weird symbols in my name or adress) 1 pcs "NSFW booster" Am I missing something? Box received this morning in France! Perfect! (email received on tuesday, box arrived by friday) Spain here, received this morning, IT'S SO SOFT . Been in contact whit the Swedish post and suprise suprise, they cant tell me jack s..t even though the provided a ID number. Extremly frustrating situation this. Again i hope its just some kind of screwup and something arrives after the weekend. Els i will contact u guys in a e-mail or here on KS. This dosent look good. I got a letter from the swedish post office saying my order/package is broken/damaged. This f...in sucks. The kicker is i just got a letter, no game och package in sight. I will wait until after the weekend and se if anything turns up. I also got the exploding kittens slip in the letter but the adress stickyslip is missing like it should be from the paper. No clue whats going on here. Thanks for another awesome game! Once you get the game mechanics down, it's pretty fun! I can't wait for expansion packs. The only complaint I have:. The chewing gum that came in the NSFW pack tastes horrible. @Michael: Es kam bei mir mit DHL und zwar gestern. Belgium here, received it yesterday! Nice box, cards, and packaging slip!! Thaaaanks Creators! I think its weird that black box couldnt provide a tracking number for international orders.. Its kind of annoying that we cant track when the game will get here.. I am from denmark and can see that other people from denmark have recieved their game, and also got emails later than me, I got my email 4th of august @ Germany: As many of you have received the game: Could you tell me which delivery service brought you the game? (DHL, Hermes, DPD,...) I haven't received mine but I also have street works in front of my door. That means no car can drive on that road and you can reach the houses only by foot. So I'd like to contact the delivere service to know if packages are held back until the roadworks are over. I love this game, however it needs more arms for holding the tools, we keep drawing everything else except arms... but we love tgis game. Grrrrrrr. FRANCE, Just received the mail from blackbox 11.08.2017. The game condition looks great, I love the game alot @Mike shipping to Mexico has already begun. Hopefully you will have yours very soon! When do games to Mexico ship? Best unboxing of a Product ever! Personalized, High qualety and all Thanks for going the extra mile! Yes it's here in Germany. Weekend is bears vs babies time. Hi, I received the email last friday, the fifth. Havent received my game yet. Is there any way you can trace the package? I'm from Belgium. Thx I did not receive additional content. Support is informed. Guys, it arrived today. Haven't played it yet, but...I am really fascinated. I opened the package and what do I see? A sheet of paper with a little cartoon on it. A little cartoon with all my personal details. Wow! This little piece of epicness just blew my mind. :) Thank you!!!! Got the mail on the 5th of august. sadly still no package :-( does anyone knows which parcel service is used in germany? Blackbox, the shipping company, was very efficient and smooth with sorting out a problem I had. Got the package today in Denmark! Good job as always; please take over the other kickstarter campaigns that I pledged on. @Brandon shipping to Asia has already begun. Hopefully you will receive an email very soon! @Ray R. email us at <email> and we'll help you out! Germany arrived today . Mail from Blackbox from 04.08.2017. :) Finally I got the mail from BlackBox! ... the weird thing is that is been sent from the UK to Mexico... I hope it doesn't take long to get here Just got mine here in vienna (austria) :) Just got my copy. Thanks a lot guys. Can't wait to play it. (Germany) My copy has arrived in Denmark in perfect condition. @Zain 'Sylverphyre' Hamzah : for me it took 8 days @hisashi How many days from receiving email to receiving the game? Germany arrived +1 Received in Singapore yesterday, woohoo! Game arrived in Denmark, 5 days after email Still waiting in Malaysia for mine =(. Got e-mail on 2 August, but still hasn't arrived. Game arrived 5 days after email in Germany Received in Stoke-on-trent UK yesterday. Excellent work on the rules documentation Got mine yesterday - love the box I'm in Norway and got my shipping mail from Blackbox today! Looking forward to getting my hands on this awesome game! :-) Still no email from blackbox :( anyone from Singapore yet to receive their copy? @Ashley, That's great to hear. I hope shipping to Asia starts soon! Hi, I guess my last comment got eaten by Kickstarter somehow. I'm in the US, and still haven't received a shipping email at all. Update! We have now shipped 13,672 orders from our UK Warehouse. That is almost 90%of our total orders waiting to be shipped from there. @Martin oh no! Email us at <email> and we'll help you out I just looked through the campaign page, and yeah I haven't received the nsfw stuff, no cards, no condoms! :/ Hi, how many cards are in the regular starter pack, and how many are in the nsfw pack? Because I don't think I received the nsfw pack even though I pledged and my confirmation mail from blackbox says it's sent. �great fun though! @Simon Degryse: Aaaw you’re making me jealous. Still waiting for shipping info for my Belgian delivery. � Guess what was at my doorstep yesterday. A brown box holding a fury little box. Great presentation, lotsa fun. One of the very finest projects I backed. Thank you! Revived today in UK... cannot stress how awesome this game is!!!! Just finished playing several games with the family and everyone loves it!!! Amazing presentation and really nice touch with the shipping note. WELL worth the wait!! **** THANK YOU ****** @David Moore, just checked with blackbox and your game was shipped today! You should receive it very soon Received in the UK today. all nicely furry @Ashley so I completed the survey by 09.30 on the same day, 3 April. Others in Sheffield have posted they have received. Keen to get playing, not bellyaching. To the Danish backers, here's a short answer from blackbox: We unfortunately don't have tracking info on international orders like yours. I'm sorry! It's a bummer, I know. International shipping typically takes 7-10 business days. If you don't receive your package after that, let me know and I'll see what I can do to help you out from there. - Stephanie So I expect my package of fur to arrive in the next few days @Samuli - yep, just got mine today(from Denmark) Anyone in the Nordic countries start to receive their yet? @ashley thanks - received my email from Blackbox this morning. Thank you for your patience :-) Just got mine in Italy ! Bearyeah ! Hey Guys, I begin to worry. I live in germany, munich. I got my Blackbox mail on August 4th but still no game - today again nothing. :-( Any way you can check this @ElanLee? It arrived not too long ago again here in the UK, wow that was fast. It is even better than I could have hoped for. From Belgium: it arrived just an hour ago in all its furry glory, got the shipping confirmation on Friday Bears Vs. Babies arrived at its destination in Denmark AOK Arrived 9:30 this morning, #winning Got my shipment email from Blackbox early this morning here in the UK! Excitement levels are rising. Is it possible to know the delivery service in Germany? There are road works in front of my house and the whole letter-mails are held back until the works are over (on friday). You can get to all houses by foot, but you can't park your car or drive on that road. But I saw some services like "Hermes" that delivered packages (by foot), while other services like DHL haven't. I'd like to ask them, when the package will arrive because most people in germany (that also got their blackbox mail on August 4th) got their game already. Thanks in advance! got my blackbox email yesterday so hoping it will arrive in Dublin soon Hi there, i am a little bit unsure, if i fill out the survey. Can i check this anywhere? @Elan Lee Thanks! @ashley thank you, I have received my blackbox email hope to get the game soon Got mine in Norway today [6 days after I got the shipping confirmation from Blackbox]. I was away, so it may have been hibernating in my mailbox for a few days before I found it. Got my email today rom Blackbox. shipping from UK to Madrid (Spain). The game is finally on its way! We are now at 12,858 orders shipped from our UK warehouse. Thats about 81 percent of our total orders waiting to be shipped from that warehouse. whoops, meant to be to @Peter not @Simon, sorry :P @Simon and @Ashley I got my survey request at 14:10 on 03/04/17 and survey confirmation at 14:26 on the same day and have yet to recieve either shipping notification email or the game. I am highly sceptical that Blackbox is actually fullfilling the deliveries in the order of survey completion... Update @Simon and @Peter I just checked with Blackbox and it looks like both of your items have shipped today. They should be on your doorstep in the next few days. @Simon 78% is out of the total in our UK warehouse. The UK warehouse services almost all of our international shipping, and we don't have a way of going through each country to get an individual count. I'll post another number update a little later, but we're almost done with fulfillment from our UK warehouse, which means you should be getting your copy very very soon. Got my game today ( Germany ). And OMG it is awesome. You did a good job. And i love the whole package, anf i love the idea of the comic on the bill. Thank you. And pls continue your ideas. @ashley with one of your previous comments you said 11000 UK orders shipped and 78% of worldwide orders shipped, what percentage of UK orders have been shipped. As peter said mine was also confirmed early April, although I have ordered multiple is this a cause for delay, as work colleagues have received theirs and we are getting them delivered to the same address @ashley I do find that somewhat odd, I got my survey email at 16:47 on 03/04/17, and got my response confirmation email at 18:17 on 03/04/17. Am I to believe that nearly everyone else in the UK responded within an hour ? Still no email confirmation, it's getting very frustrating @David fulfillment is done in the order of shipping surveys being filled out as well as geographical location. Received my game last week (UK). Looks good - thank you. Have my shipping notification (UK), unfortunately to my old address. I did ask nearly a month ago to try and update my address but told it was too late, so have to hope the people who have moved in let me know. Im in Germany. Got the email on Saturday and the game arrived today. Looks really nice. Thank you for the great job What's the relationship between fulfilment delivery and backer? Are multiples going out later. Alphabetical. By backer number. Still a big nope on the notification and delivery to Sheffield, UK No game here in vienna Another day goes by without any bears at my door :( (UK) Still no email from Blackbox, emailed support on July 27th and was told that they had everything they needed but the game might not reach the UK until the end of August. It's sad to have gotten those generic shipping updates saying that everything will be on time only to not actually get the game for months after. I understand that moving these things must be a huge project but it feels that it could have been organised a bit more fairly or maybe the backers could have been warned in advance. An die deutschen, die das Spiel schon haben: Kam es per DHL oder mit der normalen Briefpost? Received my blackbox email AND the parcel at the same time! Cute little furry box :) (Manchester, UK) Still no email or Bears for me in the U.K. - this is starting to be both worrying and feel personal. Denmark backer here! Nothing recieved yet, just the blackbox email from last week, still awaiting updates or something from PostNord Received in the UK today. Wonderful presentation and smart game Received the game! (Germany) Has anyone in Denmark received their BvB? I have only received a shipping notification from blackbox with no tracking number. Received mine today. From Singapore! Really happy with the overall package and the contents of it. Everything inside was well-thought out :-) Mail here in France ! Landed in Japan! Pretty cool. Received in Singapore! Quickborn, Germany. I was furly surprised by the postman holding a little package in his hands for me! Furry box and Expansion Pack received! Maybe I could use the box as a small pillow... :o) Loving the game so far! wish there were less bodies with tool attachments and more with arm attachment tho. Have a question about provoke cards.. if your deal on in the opening hand, what do you do? do you discard it? or shuffle back into the deck? you cant play as theres no bears or babies on the board yet. Received mine today in Belgium. Got the email from blackbox on 4th Aug. Got an order shipped email on the 4th Aug (Friday) got home to find a note from my neighbour that the near feral kids on their school holidays had found a package left on my doorstep and decided to abscond with it!! Thankfully my dear neighbour was able to retrieve it, and as a result I had a lovely evening destroying baby armies !! All present and correct, love the furry box ;-) Great build / material quality. Good fun. (UK) I can confirm another Blackbox notification about a package to Finland. Got e-mail from Blackbox this morning, package is on it's way to Finland! Yay :) I got my game today in Thailand :) Just received the email from BlackBox in France! Received my game yesterday here in Italy!! So looking forward to playing it, but not until I buy some protective sleeves!! Just received the mail from blackbox in Spain :D @Gerard van den Akker, good to hear man! I have mine yet to recieve (Netherlands, Europe, I ordered 9 decks) cant wait!!! whoop!! Finally received an email from Blackbox. It says shipping to the Philippines is "free from UK". Maybe the rest of the Asian backers will receive theirs now too. @Fernando Aguilar: La semana pasada recibí el correo de BlackBox diciendo que viende desde UK pero no he hallado la forma de rastrear el paquete. Así que, solo esperare. ¿cómo te va hasta ahora? Singapore - No news, no emails no nothing yet :( @Brandon Japanese shipments are coming from our UK warehouse as well so you should have an email very soon! Derbyshire, UK: My partner and daughter are unpacking the game right now. They keep finding more extras - literally weeping with laughter. Thanks so much! @Ashley and Creators, Any update for Asian countries like Japan? Hi guys, many thanks, got mine in North Yorkshire today. Great surprise on my return from holiday. Loved the extra bits, they made my day! Well worth the wait. We're now at 11,950 UK orders shipped! That's 78 percent of the total and that ships all over the world from the UK to South Africa, South America, and Middle America. Hi @Justin! I just replied to your email. Once your shipping survey is filled out we can get your game processed and sent on its way. In North Carolina and still haven't received an email or a box. Already saw the game in a department store. Always thought backers would receive copies before stores. :( And I already emailed support. Again. Hello everyone! We are at 10,861 packages being shipped and we're continually working with Black Box to identify any possible delays. If your package has been lost/stolen/damaged or has items missing please email us at <email> and we can help you out! Got my E-Mail in Germany and now waiting for the box to arrive @Jonathan email us at <email> and we can get the correct ship slip sent your way! Got an e-mail and can´t wait! WOHOOOO Not received mine yet either UK, and no email :( No delivery yet in Germany :( Not Even a Mail from Blackbox I just received it in the Netherlands. Thanks! Received in Poland today! Thank you! Got mine today, Swedish post office actually did their job for once! Can't wait to try it out. Got mine today in Austria. Fur box seems to have some hair-loss problems, otherwise awesome! No Blackbox email or delivery yet for an eager backer here on the Kent coast in UK. Sad times, the waiting is the hardest part. In the UK here: I got mine so they're still arriving. Game arrived on 4th August here in UK. Hoped to give bears vs babies for someone's Bearthday 08/08, but still no shipping mail here in Belgium. Changing jobs next week, guess I'll have to come back in to collect the game once it is shipped. Still no email - I'm in Germany. @ the Germans around here: any clue which company will deliver the game? Received an email, so far DPD isn't listing anything. Got my package the other day and was amazed by how much care you put into wrapping it! Look forward to playing the game! :) Still no email or Bears for me in the U.K.... Nope on the notification and nothing in today's post, Sheffield, UK I don't think that "Ready to ship" in BackerKit isn't really meaningful. My BackerKit also says "Ready to Ship" but a few days before I received my shipping info to germany. Nothing in Spain yet Mine is still marked as Ready to Ship on backerkit, when can I expect it to be delivered. It is supposed to be coming to my work address and others have already had theirs delivered to the same address. So I see some have received from Denmark. I still haven't seen anything regarding this game. It seems a bit weird how this shipping is being handled... Nothing in Mexico :( Hi, does this shipping have tracking number? when i backed the Exploding Kittens blackbox send me a notification with the number, in this case, i just received the notification, not the number My game has been stolen/lost. The tracking says it has been delivered, but I have not received any parcels lately. I am highly disappointed, since I paid extra for the Imploding Kittens pack! Of all the freaking games in our house this one is the most played. SO SORRY BUT THIS HAS BEAT OUT EXPLODING KITTENS! Thanks guys!! Already enjoyed a couple matches with wife and friends. Cheers! A very good game indeed! Got it in Ireland! Got the email, and few days later the box itself. Furry all over my shirt! I *think* I received mine, however, the delivery box was empty, and all I have to show is a note from Royal Mail saying 'the contents are missing. Anyone had the same issue! Fyi, I've contacted Black box support to see if it is the delivery - I got the email last week so only assuming it is. Lucky you @Chaparret, still nothing in Madrid. Not even the email. How long did it take to receive the game since the email reached you? Got my shipping info this moring in Spain. Still nothing here in Sweden :( A little confused with the delivery setup. My friend lives a few hundred meters from me and received his a few days ago but I've not heard anything. It also seems hit & miss whether they message you on delivering these. Can I get an update (London, UK) - impatiently waiting as ordered an extra one as a gift and they're off in a few weeks. Still nothing here in Manchester, UK :( Got the game on Saturday Kent UK... No Blackbox email or sign of game here yet, Norfolk, UK. Got the blackbox email but no tracking :/ more than a week now Game received today in Scotland. Received my game yesterday here in holland. Played it 3 times. Love it. Got Blackbox e-mail , but how to tracking? Yay! got mine yesterday in London. It is awesome! I loved the extra touch of the personalised "journey" of the game. Amazing! Thank you! +1 for "Recieved shipping email in Germany" Woo hoo got mine today. Manchester, UK Very happy and love the little extras. Thanks Elan and the whole team +1 for recieved shipping email in Denmark Got an email yesterday morning and the game turned up in the afternoon. Very happy, playing tonight. In the UK I got mine in the UK this morning too. I love the box, it's all very cute. Got my NSFW pack but only with 1 amusing condom when I thought it would be 2, but I'm not sure I care that much about that when I have babies that need eating! Got mine this morning, the box looks great, can't wait to play the game. The only downside is, I didn't receive the NFSW deck :| (I sent a mail to Blackbox already) Just got mine in the UK this morning. Winnah Just got mine in the UK, received an email on Thursday, it's so furry :D I haven't gotten an email yet. is mine still coming? from Singapore here. Another day and still no email or bears :-( in the U.K. Starting to feel personal... Just got my mail from Blackbox this morning in Denmark! :D Can't wait to get my hands on it ^_^ Got mine in Malta today! Bit bummed that the shipping information comic was the same one I got for Exploding Kittens, not the new one I saw in some unboxings :( Got my shipping info this morning, Germany. So excited *-* @Elan Lee Now I received my shipping info....yet, the update is good thing. Nice to know you are working on one. Shipping* +1 for sjipping notification in Denmark Another blackbox email received in Denmark I got mine from the post office today, in Taranaki, New Zealand :) Blackbox email received today in Denmark! Would be really great if you also did an Update, not only comments in here. Might calm some nerves ;) Received mine today in London. Loved the entire package from top to bottom. Great work @creator @Robert yann Rien pour moi / Sud de la france 10,394 orders have now been shipped out! Thats about 70% of the total orders in the UK warehouse. Game arrived with NSFW pack too. Looking forward to playing it. � @Darkson thanks for the info and happy birthday :D @GinjaBugbearNinja-Where are my Peanuts? - Royal Mail for mine. Mine arrived today, and on my birthday. Cheers all, look forward to getting a few games in. Just got my game!! So excited to play it, quality of the packaging was well worth the stretch goal etc, looks awesome :D After getting the email this morning I've come it from work to fined it waiting in all its furry glory! NSFW booster is amazing, can't wait to play. Mine came today but in card packet 2 half the cards are stuck together and the other half have the print pulled off running the card fronts and backs. Anyone else had this game problem? Possibly received in uk but I have to wait to go to the post office on Monday to collect it... Any body able to confirm royal mail are handling UK shipping? Holy bear, got my game. Thanx from Luxemburg! Great game!! Oooo...I can BEARly wait. It is truly becoming unBEARable. I am waiting for other projects, but this... it just doesn't comBEAR. Well pleased. Great box. I Carn't wait to play. Thanks Yay, received my furry bears in the UK today, and shipping email this morning :D Game on! Great game. Thank you! Woohoo, another UK receiver here Whoop! Shipping email received this morning and my big fury d*ck arrived today! Should be getting mine in the next few days then if people in the UK are receiving theirs... Nothing yet here in Spain :( received in Ireland this morning - all good - had a good laugh looking at the cards - NSFW are very much NSFW so will have to keep them away from the kids! great product, can't wait to play Got my email this morning. I'm at work all day so I just hope the girlfriend was in when the post came. I just recived my hairy box, which freaked out a neighbour who'd popped round for a cup of tea ^_^ Received last night in London! Thanks guys matches well with my First edition Exploding Kittens received in the UK.... love the packing note! Black box emailed me whoop HI all, Im in Ireland got an email on Tues for shipping and just received my game this morning :) The NSFW boosted pack it hilarious!!

UK here, received mine today soooooo hairy @simon email us at <email> and we'll replace those cards for you! Hi everyone! Just a quick update. Our warehouse reports a total of 9,252 units shipped. Thats about 60% total. This warehouse covers all of the UK, EU, South Africa, and a few other places. You all should be getting emails very soon! someone living in france as an email for the shipping or not ? i'ts too long .... Just had my first game haha brilliant no time for sleep anymore lol UK here and it finally arrived! Got my black box email yesterday and it arrived by royal mail today. Can't wait to start playing it! No shipping mail, nothing in the post office, where is it? :( Not long now UK folks - mine arrived today. They are most definitely inbound right now. UK here, still keeping my fingers crossed for an email but nothing yet. Got my shipping notice yesterday. Hoping for deliver tomorrow :-) Shipping to Sweden from the UK. I got my furry box, fantastic, love it, but i didnt get my NSFW expansion, is it delayed because of the bad cards as per the comment below? Got a 'your delivery is on its way' email this morning, an hour later the game was here. That's a seriously fast postal service! Yay! Got it, that is tomorrow lunchtime sorted :D UK backer here just recieved mine out of the blue. Fantastic work and I love the personal touch. Can't wait to play tonight you guys are the best. 3am email and arrived this morning as well! Unfortunately the NSFW expansion pack is horribly cut/misaligned printing! I got a shipment email 2 days back for Ireland, anyone know what postal service is used once out of UK? Im trying to find a way to track it.. I assume it'll be here today or tomorrow but it would be nice to know. The ref number that came with the blackbox email is too long for and tracker for postal services here. Mine arrived in UK today, backer number 67,993 Shipping email was received this morning at 4am, does not have tracking. UK items are sent via Royal Mail 24 Nope, but hope. Sheffield, UK Got a blackbox email at 3am. Here in UK Germany, still waiting for confirmation mail. But some said they've got their shipping confirmation at the day the game arrived. So I don't worry and keep hoping that shipments to germany will start soon. Thumbs up! It seems not too far away! Got the shipping email. Can't wait. UK It's been a while since I checked in on this. Is it correctly understood that not all of EU has gotten their blackbox email yet? Ok, small review. Only played 3 games with 4 players so it's a small sample. That being said, I went into this with the mindset that it was not going to be as fun as exploding kittens due to the earlier reviews. Boy was I wrong. This is a great casual game that should be played in short bursts. I can tell that if we played anymore, the flaws of the game would start to show. Although we were learning and only played 3 games, we didn't encounter the lack of body parts problem. This may be because we added some NSFW cards into the main deck. We did however encounter players that couldn't build anything because they were missing heads. With 4 players, the 2 actions per turn seems low and it got pretty lame when all everyone was doing with draw one and play one. Provoking babies to screw people over seemed like a very inefficient way to lose out on a turn with the hands we were drawing. I can definitely see the strategies involved in winning and with a larger sample size, these strategies would be better utilized, but as of now, the game plays fairly simply with a small component of competitiveness. Also, although I heavily criticized the furry box in the past, it isn't as bad as it seemed. I do wish that the money was used to further develop the game, but it's unique. Anyone want to share their house rules to make this game more efficient or fun? For our third game, we allowed people to draw body parts from the discard pile as 1 action instead. Was sat around the kitchen table - the wife, 2 daughters and I - munching Pringles and popcorn while exploding kittens at each other, and I mentioned that I can't wait until we can experience epic Bears vs Babies action. And as if the Elan & Matt gods themselves had smiled upon me that very night.....I GOT MY SHIPPING EMAIL THIS MORNING IN THE UK!!! I knew that consulting the boob wizard would help in some way...... Shipping confirmed in IT ! :-o a delivery email arrived... In the UK! :-D think I just wee'd a little Still nothing for me in the UK, but glad to see some movement. I'll just sulk and explode some kittens :-) Scotland here. Blackbox email received at 2am today. Whoop UK backer here, received my shipping email this morning at around 5am! Calloo Callay! It's UK delivery for me today! Also got my shipping email over night � How do you always mess up schickt shipping... Got shipping email, UK. Got my shipping email today. UK Still no shipping email or game yet in the UK :( Mine arrived in Montreal Canada area. It would have been yesterday of the postman was not overly lazy and stuffed it in the parcel section of the mail box. It would also have saved me a trip to the post office... Package received in Toronto, Canada today. Fake fur looks great! Just got home to find it waiting in the mail box. Very happy looks great and thank you for creating fun laughable games. My surname begins with B so if it is going out in surname order you may have a very very long wait ;) something tells me that isn’t how it is being done *sighs* still waiting on a shipping email here in the UK *sad panda face* hi, Is delivery to france shipped? Uk individual here, what is the total. Umber of orders going out of the uk warehouse? I'm glad 4K have gone but my surname starts with a T so if it is 400k I'm gonna have to hibernate :p Uk individual here, what is the total. Umber of orders going out of the uk warehouse? I'm glad 4K have gone but my surname starts with a T so if it is 400k I'm gonna have to hibernate :p Got mine. My two year old is very concerned about the kitty that came in the mail.... Will there be a mobile version of this game in the future? Montreal, Canada, got mine! Many thanks :-) Got it last night in Ontario Canada. Came in perfect shape. Thanks for everything! When is Belgium on that list??? UK warehouse shipments are steadily rising! Nearly 4000 orders are out and more are going throughout the day. These orders are going to places like Mexico and Spain as well as the UK, so keep looking for those emails. Has anyone in Mexico received either the mail or the game? No email yet, Madrid. Does anyone have received it in Spain? Just arrived in Toronto Canada. Super excited to rip it open. Nice fuzzy bear box is great! Received my game yesterday here in Ottawa, Canada! Can't wait to play!!! Email from Blackbox came today! I'm in the Netherlands. No shipping yet for Brunei. Just got a shipping email from Blackbox here in Italy!!! Super excited!! Keep on yelling - got no notification yet - suggest turning up at the distribution hub with a couple of bears in tow. I dont have trancking or email. I asked by email the status but anyone reply me. So sad :_( Poland(Płock) Got shipping email. :) @ JiLPi I received an email notification yesterday for shipment to Singapore Hi all I just got a shipping email too and I'm in Ireland Best of luck everyone Hi, any schedule for your "ROTW" (Rest Of The World) customers? I live in Hong Kong (and saw an enquiry about Thailand 10 days ago that remains unanswered) Thanks Got mine in Edmonton as well! Just got mine earlier in Edmonton, Alberta - and the FedEx delivery person mentioned they were "delivering lots of these today - is this a game?" Yes, yes it is, Fed Ex, and it looks amazing! Sooo fuzzy! Thanks Bears v Babies team! Got a shipping email today. BvsB must be close now. Living in Holland. Got mine, thanks for coming through - only KS in a while I've gotten my item when it was promised. Can't wait to play. got mine Still no sign of an email to Germany. Waiting patiently though. Got mine in Alberta, Canada. Lots of laughs just unboxing it. Can't wait to play I'm the worst. I'm a squishy fart monster! Clearly from the above comments I received my game. It looks so awesome! Delightfully furry. This condom is WAY too big! I mean small, SMAALLL! Damn it. Got my game in Hamilton, On, Canada This morning! sooo fuzzzzzy Homefries, I am in the US of A and still waiting patiently to hear that my game has shipped. Every day I check my mail. Every day I come away disappointed. I am sure you have forgotten about meh. I'm cry. Sadz. *sob* Seriously, have ALL the USA games shipped? Because if so, I need to let you guys know mine hasn't arrived. Just got it in London Ontario Canada. Love everything about it, especially the comic! Thank you for the wonderful game. Got mine! from West Coast Canada :D The furry box is so pretty :D Hey guys! Update to the update! I have checked our UK Warehouse records and we have shipped out over 3000 games from there. Many of those are to South Africa, Uruguay, and the Cayman Islands as well as the UK itself. We have no way at the moment (other than clicking on each individual order) to see where each game is going, but from what I've checked, UK orders have definitely started shipping from this warehouse as well. Hopefully you will all have emails very soon. Thank you for being patient with us while we sort this out. Sweden here, got the email early this morning at 4:50 am. @Marc email us at <email> and we'll send over a replacement card! Just a warning that the cards absorb water. One of mine soaked up a condensation ring and now has permanent water damage. The game is a lot of fun! Mine arrived today, (Edmonton) Patience is a virtue. I got mine over a week after a friend who backed at the same time as me. It arrived today. I got the email last thursday. Looking forward to playing it. It would be nice at some point during this week to get some confirmation on the shipped units (1090 as I understand at this point) in comparison to the total waiting to be shipped and also on ,realistically, how long should we be expecting to wait (hoping it's not an extra 4-6 weeks on top of the current 6 weeks)in order to avoid any disappointment. I completely understand that you guys have been doing everything you can in your side. This message is mostly intended to vent some of the impatience on my part as I can't wait to get my hands on the game, as many people here. Thanks, by the way, for all the feedback so far. @Michael its 1,090 total units that been shipped from our UK warehouse. We're asking for constant updates from our distributors and Elan has continued to yell, so we promise we'll keep you posted! I got an email bit says it will be 4-6 weeks 1090 orders have dispatched in the UK? How many UK orders in total. I am one and haven't received any update. Update from this morning! 1090 UK orders have been shipped out and still going. Nope, me neither. Waiting with fingers crossed it arrives by the weekend no email yet! can't wait to play this game! nope - no email for me in the U.K. yet either So on the UK front, has anyone received any email since yesterdays shouting match? Still nothing here Received this morning my Blackbox email for shipment to Singapore Never got any blackbox email. When can I expect the babies to raid my house? Eventhough I have yet to recieve my BvB (Netherlands), I wanna compliment Elan on the updates and its frequency! Thanks for this!! Oeeee I cant wait!! Fun game, played with 4 and 2, good laughs need expansions..! :D Yea, checked my pledge manager and still says ready to ship..... I've gotten nothing, Toronto, ON. What gives seeing people as far north as Thunder Bay getting it. Got mine in Ottawa, haven't played yet but love the packaging and LOVE the personalised comic hahaha. Another Canadian here, got mine here in Thunder Bay, Ontario! I love it :D Got mine in podunk Medicine Hat , AB. Second best furry box I've ever played with I've yet to receive mine. Anyone else in Japan have any luck? Love love love the game! We played it immediately. It was a blast! Got my game yesterday (Melbourne, AU) - never got a blackbox notification though. Great game, artwork and packaging! Everyone loved it! Awesome, thanks :) @Elan Lee Thanks for the update, but do you have a guarantee from them that this is actually the case as it isn't the first time they've said shipping would start that day? Thanks :) Got mine :) - Edmonton, AB Canada @Ashley alright thanks! I was just curious a bit, since a lot in the same city got it and I didn't. But thanks :) @Jean-Sebastien Fauteux shipping is still underway and hopefully you'll have your game very soon! @10,000Lumen we're using Backerkit to collect backers address information and Blackbox to fulfill game shipments! Hey how about an internationale update. When can i excpect my game in Germany? A few friends of mine, in the same city got their game a week ago. Still no email, nothing here. Montreal, Canada. What's going on? Arrived today at Vancouver Canada; got a notification from BlackBox ahead of time. For my Canadian (Toronto) friends, I just got my game today in all it's furry glory (condom and all)! I did not receive an email at all, it just showed up at my door! Cheers @Elan or @Ashley are you dispatching through Gamesquest? Received shipping notice last Fri, with expected delivery today (Mon). It arrived!!! GTA, ON, CA Hi Ashley - thanks for the reply. Both the NSFW pack and bonus item weren't in the box. Don't care much for the bonus item but definitely want the NSFW booster! I will send over an e-mail. So nobody gets the points? That sucks. @xjoaniex the "official" rule is that nothing happens. Monsters and babies both stay on the table, and the player that provoked has essentially skipped their turn by doing so. I have a game play question. If the babies are provoked and more than one player have monsters with the same strength, who wins the battle. I would think the provoking player would get priority? @Darren the NSFW pack is its own separate black foil pack. If you ordered one and didn't receive it please email us at <email>! @Elan Lee any update from the yelling? Received my shipping notification on the 29th that it should arrive on the 31st. Just got it now, right to the front door. I'm in Ottawa, Ontario. And my friend got his a couple days ago. Also Ottawa. Love the personalised note, musta taken a while to make those. The box is smaller than I thought it would be, and wayy more amazing, lol. On a side note - the box is really cool. I was a little worried it'd be large and cumbersome, but it's quite nicely packaged. Got mine today! Looks fantastic! Can't wait for the weekend when I can try it out with some friends. Brampton (near Toronto), Ontario. Still no shipping notification in Ontario, Canada. I just checked how long it took to ship my Exploding Kittens pledge, and I got the shipping notification the SAME DAY as shipping was announced. We are now into August, so who dropped the ball on this one? I emailed support last week and never even heard back from them. still no email for me today in the U.K. does seem very strange that they've arrived everywhere apart from Europe, where the appear to be stuck. @Elan Lee Did the shouting and cursing help get a better understanding of where the EU stands regarding Brexit...I mean bears vs babies delivery? Arrived today. Australia. Excellent. I was expecting the box to be tacky but it is quite whimsical. The thank you note and invoice are classic. @Howdn and sorry is the hardest word Still no delivery mail for germany... Argh waiting time is the hardest time :-) No news or shipping notification here in Ontario Canada. Nothing on the Singapore side here as well... Really enjoying this game! The boxing and card art work is fantastic. I play it at lunch time with work colleagues and it has become a hit and they ask if they can play it when I'm not in the office. Great game, and even the invoice was amusing. Kids loved it, it's going in the shelf next to the well-work Exploding/Imploding Kittens boxes. Double checked and it's definitely missing from my order. I'll follow up with an email. A bit confused. Is the NSFW pack included in the box? I can't tell Received shipping notice! Should be here Monday (GTA, Ontario, Canada) <url>’( I was hoping to get it to try as a final lunch time game with my work game group before I change job, seems that is unlikely to happen now :( In Ontario, Canada, still waiting for my game to ship. I understand that delays happen but for us in the uk and Europe to have to wait over 6 weeks after the US for our games seems a bit unfair. Any update on progress as soon as possible would be appreciated. Let's hope we all get a look-in in the EU / UK next week. Someone at the distribution warehouse getting the hairdryer treatment should see some movement! I must admit after how smooth the Exploding Kittens process was Im disappointed with how this one is going. Lets hope the shipping "issues" are resolved next week. Games received, but there is not an idiot proof instruction on what to do if there was a miss-pack (two package ones, no two). Is it the blackbox address, or the support one in the updates? From Montreal.. Got a notice, received the game the day after... All seems cool, didn't count the cards yet. One condom missing. Like the personalized strip cartoon, well played. The game look cool, shame I didn't get two. From Montreal.. Got a notice, received the game the day after... All seems cool, didn't count the cards yet. One condom missing. Like the personalized strip cartoon, well played. The game look cool, shame I didn't get two. @Larry B. Did you receive notice of shipping? How was it delivered (Canada Post, courier company?) In Ontario Canada. Got the game yesterday. Played a round with my wife. Definitely a game that will work better with more players. But it was funny, and easy to pick up. I think Kittens was more complex and still is the better game though, overall. @Ashley Are all 19% in europe seen as no one here has received ANYTHING? We were told UK shipping issue shad been resolved and commenced this week. Can you provide a further update? Hello everyone. Here is a shipping update for you! We have currently shipped 81% of the orders which is roughly 65,859 people with Bears vs Babies in their paws! We're still working very hard to get the rest of the orders packed and shipped out and will keep you posted on progress! Anyone received theirs in singapore? No tracking number yet. :( Still no tracking or ship notification here. Northern Alberta, Canada if that helps. Quickly.... the babies are advancing.. I think I read yesterday.. or was it day before that the container arrived in UK.. so its strange nobody has received anything yet Still nothing in UK it seems.. I"m waiting for people in UK to get theirs.. then I know mine will arrive a few days later as I'm in Ireland Still no word on shipping here (UK) Any Idea when South African orders will start shipping. Ah well it's a race between this and massive darkness atm both should arrive at the same time hopefully :D I got mine in regional australia no nothing for me either in the U.K. - makes me wonder if they are using Gamesquest for fulfillment here Still nothing in the UK Nope I'm in UK anybody got black box email yet? Backer #50,050 received in Alaska! Playing it at the fire station soon!! Red Deer, Alberta - Received on Monday. Got the shipping notice on July 21 and it arrived on July 24th. Love, love, love the packaging. <3 FYI, received my shipment to Australia a few days ago (including additionally ordered Exploding Kittens). Never received a shipping email though. I did check spam folders. Hope you all get your shipment soon! Wow, you guys are packaging masters, really good job! Just received my copy yesterday (Vancouver, BC)! Loved the contents and the presentation was phenomenal! Got my email the night before it shipped and didn't see it until after it had arrived so I was happily surprised. For those still waiting, I wish you patience, as the wait is worth it! Thanks guys for the awesome game! Nope. Sheffield, UK, come on postie! Montreal, QC Canada, received it today :) sooooo funny!! ... (checks email)... sighs... stares off into distance...sighs...(checks email again)... No nothing for me in the U.K. either. :-( Nothing yet in UK I'm afraid :( Still waiting on a shipping email in the Uk. Mine is still marked as ready to ship. I got my game today. Hours after getting an email that it shipped with a tracking number. So yeah it is weird. Weird like a furry box. When will the delivery come to Malaysia? Arrived in Perth Western Australia! Has anyone in the UK received theirs yet? Still waiting on mine �. I dunno, I somehow consider the shipping box part of the packaging and keep the game and its assortment of little fiddly extras stored inside. Maybe, some day, I'll get all fanciful and procure one of those plastic storage bins, that are designed to hold card or board games and configure it to store my Exploding Kittens and BVB games within. Anyone have their own make-shift, personally designed or obtained means of storage or presentation they fancy and are willing to share? :P Got mine today in Vancouver, Canada...Best packing slip ever! I received my fuzzy box! I must say it also came with the best order shipping slip I have ever seen! Thanks again guys, looking forward to playing! Received mine here in Halifax! Hi great peeps! Have you starting delivering to Norway? @yugiyogi - Yes, Belgium will be shipping from the UK. Keep an eye out for that email! You can email <email> us if you have more questions! @yugiyogi - Yes, Belgium will be shipping from the UK. Keep an eye out for that email! You can email <email> us if you have more questions! @R email us at <email> and we'll help you out! Received my furry box, with the best card game inside! Here in Montreal. Received my furry baby here in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Super excited to play this game, but still waiting in Ottawa, Canada. Arrived in Melbourne today (Well, Ok, on Friday, but I only managed to get to the Post Office today). Absolutely amazing! Exceeds expectations as usual! Thanks heaps guys! :D Seems like even though the shipping says not to leave it anywhere, the canada post dude "lost" my package even though it shows as delivered... :'( Yay!!! Received today in Australia! Bring on the babies! Mwahaha!!!!!! @Nick Blackburn, good to hear! im so jealous right now :D Do the UK orders include order to the rest of Europe? haven't received a shipping mail to Belgium yet! Arrived safe and sound today in Christchurch, New Zealand :o) Can't wait to sit down and play Thank You So Much @Elan Lee and all the Bears vs Babies team...you've outdone yourselves :o) Mine arrived over the weekend - played a round SO MUCH FUN!! I never got an email about shipping BUT my game arrived today, it's so amazing! I love it! You guys are awesome I can't wait to see what else you come up with! Arrived today in Alice Springs, can't wait to get home and play with some mates. This game is beautiful! The invoice is beautiful! You are beautiful! Thank you! @Graham Woloski, lucky! Still waiting for my email :( Got it this morning. The invoice is fantastic! Received in Australia, thanks! Best. Invoice. Ever! @dysonparkes - Email <email> and we'll make sure you get your NSFW Expansion Pack! got my tracking in Vancouver, BC :D I'm from Malaysia. Still haven't receive any email from Blackbox. Shipping update! UK orders confirmed that they have started shipping today. Australia and Canada are sending out the remaining orders. Keep an eye out for those emails! Thnx for the update @Elan! Whooooop!!! Received my shipping email today - Montreal, Canada. Got my copy today in Auckland, New Zealand. Had got security checked by customs because the box was marked "Exploding Kittens". :chuckle: @Elan thanks for the update Just patiently waiting for my shipping email. My package arrived in Tasmania, Australia today - it was hilarious to see the reactions of my workmates when they felt the NSFW addon packet and realised what was in it! :D Thanks Elan, Matthew, and everyone else who was involved! I look forward to playing this evening! Game & expansion received in Wellington NZ. Look forward to playing! Cheers Received my game today in Christchurch, New Zealand. We had a good laugh when we read the description on the packing slip, "Exploding Kittens". How did that make it through Customs??? :-P Backer #84,300. I just finally received Bears vs Babies here in Hawaii. No email or any kind of indication that it was shipped. I was really starting to get worried, but here it is. I am excited. Thank you!! Got my game here in NZ - paperwork says NSFW booster, but no NSFW pack or condom in the box. The Kickstarter exclusive card is there (awesome). According to the packing slip I should have a NSFW Expansion deck, but I most certainly don't. How do I go about getting the missing components? Got my game and booster here in NZ. Looking forward to giving it a go! Received it here in Australia. Thanks heaps guys, you've done an awesome job with this game Got it in Australia :) Can't wait to give it a whirl! Got it yesterday, played two games, so much fun! Looking forward to cracking it out at games night next week. Got it last week, Seattle WA. Played it last night all the way through, and we had a lot of fun. I'm already looking forward to new packs and more mechanics if they become available! I received my box today and had to laugh at the "personalized" message inside because- and its no joke- there's a sign on my row of mailboxes warning mothers to not walk with infants to the mailbox because of the rash of bear attacks on our road. Not that its something to laugh at- I live in Eagle River, Alaska. Scott, read like 4 below yours, Last I knew Edmonton, Alberta was in Canada ;). looks like they're trickling in. don't worry I still haven't received my confirmation yet either. buddy of mine should be getting his this week too. shipped on friday. Still no BvB in Canada. Last I heard, shipment was supposed to start in mid July for us. Is there some kind of Delay? Still no bvb - Sheffield, England Cool, thanks for letting us know. My last comment was meant a bit tongue in cheek, just re-read it and realised it could be a bit misconstrued as actually be rude, sorry about that � Yaaaaa!!! My furry box arrived today bright and early in Edmonton, Alberta!! Thanks Bears Vs. Babies crew for all your hard work. Much appreciated!!! :) Hooray! My furry box arrived in Adelaide, South Australia today! Also, my game arrived! :D Haha! HI - St Louis Missouri. I still have not received anything. I did complete the survey. What's up? A quick trip to the Post Office in Canberra AU resulted in babies. And bears. Also a burrito wielding shark who is also a Taco. The invoice-comic possibly made the day of my 8 year old. That is all. Netherlands here, no sign of the BvB yet. Aahhh cant wait to recieve and play it!! :D My copy arrived today. Gold Coast, Australia. @Elan So are we just ignoring all the people in the UK and the wider EU asking if there is any sign of them shipping for us? ;) :p have they actually started shipping in the EU yet? because the comments would suggest not Nothing yet in Canada here :) vancity needs some love! Got mine today, Brisbane Australia Games have arrived today in Australia, loved the box, thanks heaps!!! UK and mine is still marked only as Ready to Ship :( Received game today - Brisbane, Australia Hooray, mine has finally arrived down here in Queensland. Hey guys, does anyone know what courrier company they are using for delivery? @justwes I don't think anyone in the UK has heard anything yet. Very fun game. Loved the packing slip as well. Looking to see if anyone in the UK has received and email about shipping or received the game yet. Denmark her. No bears spotted yet! Did someone in the EU recieved their package? I still not recieve any Mail from Blackbox :( anyone in eu got their game yet? I got my box in all of its furry gloriness. What happens when two people's army's are the same strength and are fighting the baby army? I'm going to ask the question that's on everyone's minds: has anyone used the condom yet? Got mine the other day. Kids love it! Everything about this project has been outstanding! Anyone in Ontario Canada get one yet? Received blackbox email today. Shipped via FedEx. Says it should arrive Wednesday. Edmonton, Alberta. Got mine today. BEST PACKING SLIP EVER!!! Any words for shipping to Thailand? I haven't received any email about shipping. I have confirmed the address in Backerkit already. Thank you. Got my game today, loved the message with it. - Squishy fart monster Got mine today! Ontario Canadian here. should i be worried i haven't received shipping info yet? Both my packs are labelled "Packet 1". How do I get a hold of packet 2? Just arrived in Melbourne, Australia! �What an awesome surprise Got mine here in VA a few days ago, in all its furry glory! Loved the personalized shipping print out as well! Kinda wish there was more than 1 condom so we could keep ensuring the bears always win in this house, but... Played it with 2 instead of doing a college paper...which made it even more fun! Hope to play with 4 next weekend...with the couple that introduced us to Exploding Kittens & their meowing box years ago. On that note, now I'm hungry for unicorn enchiladas! Cheers guys! Great job, again! Arrived today in Ottawa Canada. ITS SO FURRY! FYI Canadian backers, my package was fulfilled by Snakes & Lattes. Not to complain, butttt... I've started recieivng emails from retialers offering pre-orders.... Still not got my copy of the game yet... Has any 1 in the UK recieved theirs? Having played with 4 players, 5 players, and 3 players, I feel like it's actually a bit more fun with 3 players, because you get more actions on your turn, so you can make more progress building a monster. I find being constrained to 2 actions sometimes leaves you just finally drawing a Head, putting it down, and then immediately being back to square one because the babies were provoked. It can happen with other action quantities, but it's less of a problem when you can throw down more cards at once. I cannot believe that when some one broke into my condo last night, they stole my Bears vs Babies. Mine is on the truck for delivery today. Can't wait to check it tonight! To my fellow Canadians, I was pleased to receive an email from Blackbox this morning. My copy is on the way! Here's hoping that this is the first of many orders shipping north! Nope! >_< Anyone in the UK heard/seen anything yet? I got woken up by the delivery this morning and such a delightful surprise, great touches and thoughts u guys put in and love the invoice mail merge comics lol can't wait to play the game tonight when I'm home.��thank you and looking forward to your next project. received mine today and I couldn't be happier :-) Black Box did a superb job packing and shipping your product. For those asking, Ontario, Canada here and still havent received my copy. Like others, I was advised that it will ship end of this month, to be received by end of August. Kind of frustrating that people on the other side of the world are having theirs shipped out before us, but nothing to do about it but wait. To those with questions about their specific parcels or changes to shipping address, the most recent Update has the answers for you: <url>ʕ·͡ᴥ·ʔ @steve That's so good to hear. HAPPY BEARTHDAY! @daisy slight shedding is to be expected, but if it becomes more than slight please email us - <email> Any news ok UK shipping? In MD. Haven't received any notifications as of yet. Waiting patiently. International shipping apparently started a week ago but has anyone outside the US actually received anything? Even an email? Doesn't seem so from looking at the comments My has arrived with all it's furry glory Still no notice :( Soooooo I still have yet to hear anything from you guys... no game... no email... it's July... we have successfully missed Father's Day, my anniversary, and in a few days my birthday... am I going to see this thing this summer? Still waiting.... No emails.... Still waiting patiently for my copies, no emails and double checked my emails and have confirmation emails for completion of backerkit and the right address. ( in the us) can't wait to play and give my son his late birthday present. I was informed that all rewards to Canada will start shipping nearer to the end of the month and we will see our game by the end of August. I don't understand why this is? I was told it's because international orders take longer to process, but I got rewards from a Kickstarter from California when people in the US are still waiting on theirs, and this other project actually shipped 2 months early. @Travis In Canada and still haven't even received a shipping notice from backerkit @ Travis: Canada will be last in the shipping — and, even if isn't, Canada Post will hold it for a long time. :-( @travis. Still nothing in Quebec. No email from blackbox.. Got my order of 2 games and 2 NSFW expansion packs. You guys did a GREAT job on this. Love the box too. This is one hell of a great birthday present, received on the right day. Got my order of 2 games today and noticed there is some slight shedding, not sure if that is to be expected. @Travis Bruce nothing for me in Vancouver. Still says 'Ready to ship' on backerkit. It will come eventually. @ali feel free to email <email> and we can check on it for you! @D. Bizzle Fo Shizzle Strange! Feel free to reach out to <email> and we'll get you all sorted out. We want to make sure you aren't missing any cards! Anyone in Canada with one yet. Looking at Ontario mostly. Nothing happen in Thailand. The game came in and we played for the first time yesterday! Loved it, very funny. My wife and I played, but I can imagine it's even better with more people Not gonna lie... the cartoon on my receipt was pretty accurate I will say, my 7-year-old son is enjoying playing the game, too. He mostly just likes building silly monsters, but it's been nice having a game more advanced than Candy Land that we can play together. It's been several weeks since my friend got his copy, but still no word on mine. When should I expect it? Wahoo! We got our game and have played several times so far. Love it and love the fur covered box! Finally! A shipping notification! :) Woohoo! My copy arrived! Can't wait to play it at my next game night. @elan I am an awful artist. My girlfriend is pretty good though. If there was one card you would add to the game, what would it be? Will an update be posted when a specific region has finished shipping, ie: once US shipping is fully completed, will we be notified so then we can be concerned if we don't have a game and/or tracking number? I got my game yesterday. My chick and I played. Just with us two, it was pretty awesome! Thanks AGAIN (I backed Exploding Kittens too)! You two are awesome, The Oatmeal and Elan. I look forward to more expansions are MOAR GAMES!!!!11 @elan I just did an inventory of all cards. Other blank card just seems to be an extra. I'm with you there. Still waiting. I still have ready to ship status in my backerkit :( Did anyone else receive a blank card in their deck? Anyone from or near denmark who has received either notification or the game yet? � Ahh so many people talking about the game and Im still waiting on the blackbox email. I can't wait to play :D There be Bears in Dallas, Texas (USA). You guys are so great. You even made the packing list fun. Keep up the crazy. :) Got my Blackbox.cool e-mail. Yay got mine last week.love it,really fun game.so glad to have been a part of this project. @larry feel free to email us! <email> We'll check on everything for you and loop in Blackbox. @Grammaw definitely going to start using that word in every day vocab ;) @david Totally normal. Thank you for your patience! @jason Feel free to email us and let us know what happens. We want to make sure you get your game! this mite be the greatest card game i have played in a long time, and i am a collector. I did not think the rainbow sidings are a problem believe the three pile deck allows for true randomness no matter how poorly you shuffle. I have only played with two people and you go through droughts of a certain card type like any card game but have not seen any kinks in the system that are anything other then random chance. you guys did a AMAZING JOB once again and i cant wait to see what the crazy expansions you come out with and what you think up next @ No doubt they're lazy, most people are. But the rainbow banner on the sides of the Bears aren't necessary at all to the play of the game, so I'm simply observing that they serve no purpose and can have a negative impact on play. @Mercurius haha, sounds like your friends are either stubborn or lazy. If they refuse to do so and people can see that its a bear card then its their own fault for not trying to hide it better by just flipping it over. @Mister Jeeves - I've shared that with my friends, too, but they still insist on not doing so. Removing the rainbow lines would make it less of an overall issue, however. @Mercurius do you have the bear head face up or face down underneath the mask? I always tell players to keep the head card face down in case the mask card slides off revealing the card underneath. I think it even suggests that in the FAQ section. STILL HAVENT RECIEVED! I see pics all over web people enjoying the game. I've now failed two game nights not having the game to bring. WOW! So let down. Probably never open now. BOOO! I moved about a week before the game arrived at my old address, but I had mail forwarding set up. FedEx says my package was delivered to my old address, but BlackBox still lists it as In Transit. I've had someone verify the package is not at my old address. Was the package forwarded, returned to sender, or is it MIA? Having played the game a few times now, I find that the worst part is getting stuck without a head. In addition, despite the name, Bears are really more of a liability than a strength, because they always fight everything and can be wiped off the board pretty quickly. Our group is thinking of making Bears return to your hand after fighting. This shores up the downside of them constantly being beaten off the board, and it gives you the chance to always have a head available. Also, the rainbow pattern on the side of the Bear cards makes them rather obvious when under the Mask card. I got my copy yesterday (Thanks for the cartoon!) but I never got an email saying it was being shipped. I've been keeping an eye out for it and I double checked my spam box but it just never showed up. Nevertheless, the game arrived safe and sound. Pink, you got a personalize invoice? All I got from these buttnuggets is an invoice that makes fun of me! I don't mean any of that, devs; I just like using that word. :) Just got mine in! Soooo excited! @Witt I've contacted FedEx but dealing with their customer service has been a headache. Each rep I talked to couldn't seem to understand the situation. I've checked the tracking and it's scheduled for delivery next Wednesday the 19th. I'll be keeping close tabs on the tracking and hopefully it'll actually get delivered. Got mine today. Didn't get an email, so it was kind of a surprise. Soooooo is perfectly normal not having yet any email confirmation of shipping or any other info? This game is amazing thank you. My copy is "out for delivery!" YAY! It only took 10 days to get from California to Iowa. @Jason Were you able to get in touch with FedEx? Is your game on its way back to you? Feel free to email <email> if you need help! That settles my frustration. Thank you good sir. While I was at work yesterday, the post office delivered my copy and left it outside my apartment. A few hours later FedEx came by make a pick up from my roommate. Without using any common sense they picked up my package and now my copy is somewhere in Pennsylvania. So at best I'm waiting another week to get my copy... Got mine earlier this week (WA state), love the personalized invoice. It sucks that International pledges had to wait till all the US ones were shipped... Guess we are less loved than the States :( Northern California got mine today. What an awesome game. The fuzzy box is the best and I can't stop laughing at all the epic artwork. Has anyone in AL gotten theirs? :( Never mind. If I'd read the FAQ then I'd answered my own question. Never mind. If I'd read the FAQ then I'd answered my own question. Maybe I missed it in the rules but what happens if there is a tie between players that can both beat the monster? @Chris email us! <email> we'll help you out! What would a lowly backer do if they received bent up mashed corners on their cards. that appears to of been don during packaging on the production line @Joanne I completely understand your frustration! We're not shipping by backer number, so don't worry, you haven't missed out on anything! We're still shipping, and international shipping has just started, so hopefully you'll have your paws on the game very soon! It's frustrating to read that over 44 thousands of orders went out and I haven't heard a peep! My backer number is in the 4000's. I double checked with Blackbox to confirm they got my survey. Yup, feeling very frustrated. :( Can't wait to play it! Hoping it'll arrive before my family vacation this weekend. It would be highly entertaining to play it with the whole family. We got our copy right before the fourth. We played several games on the fourth and had a blast! Love the sneaky extras and the cool furry box. Great game! Thanks so much for all your hard work. It soooooo paid off. Got my copy today! Will be playing tonight. Received my game in Southern CA today! My brother got his a few weeks ago (also in So Cal). Are they coming ups USPS or HOPE lol seriously dying to play this @Sean Larson, be careful with liquor and this game. I played with a group the other day and intoxication resulted with a drink spilling on a couple of my cards. I was not pleased with this. Received!! It's awesome. I would love to know if I can get more of those condoms :-D I received this last week, looks great, just trying to find time to ply my friends with enough liquor to play. The company is called Blackbox but the boxes are blue..... #AlternativeBlack Would it be best to email the support email if we still haven't received any update or email confirmation of shipping? Got my copy in the mail last week in Ohio. Game is super amazingly fun. Super happy with the final product. @Donald Boley It appears they're not shipping on a regional basis. My friend in Columbus got his early last week but I, also in Columbus, still have no sign of mine or even a tracking email. @ Richard Braun rewards to Canada will not be filled until the middle of the month, so we can expect to see our product in August. Has anyone in Ohio received their game? Has anyone in western Canada received theirs yet? Any update on Canadian shipping dates? When does shipping to NL start? Still ready to ship... I'm moving at the end of the month... New Jersey No e-mail in spain here. Any idea when Australian delivery starts? Japan here, nothing yet And I have yet to get any info on shipping or tracking. Anyone in Japan get theirs yet?? I haven't received anything yet. May I get an update please? Mine was never delivered though it says it did can I order a new one I think mine got stolen :/ Why did I get a thing in the mail saying USPS has my package and I owe $7.20 for postage? I'm in southern California also and have heard nothing. Meanwhile, several of my friends who backed have already received theirs and are rubbing it in my face When should we start worrying that we haven't gotten a shipping notice. In SoCal, only got one order, nothing so far. Booo. Still waiting. :( I am in Seattle and backed this pretty early. What about Mexico? Call me inpatient but i was hoping to hear something by now. The only other difference between my sisters order and mine is the number of sets ordered. One for her and 3 for me. @abby I don't think it had anything to do with backer order or when you finished the survey. Like I said earlier my sister backed after I did and finished the survey days after I did and she received hers a week ago. Any news on UK delivery? Shannon Letro: I live in IN (Purdue) and got mine a couple of weeks ago. Aren't these usually fulfilled in about backer order? I might be earlier on the list than you, but mine came really quickly. I did not get a specific shipping notification that I can see. I only ordered a single pack, and I'm still waiting for a shipping/tracking info @thomas, mine was in my mailbox, so USPS. I live In Indiana and I filled out my shipping survey early. If orders should be received mid July wouldn't I have gotten a shipping notification by now? Since technically mid July is 5-6 days from now? Does anyone know what delivery service they used e.i. ups or usps From an efficiency perspective, I would imagine that the single orders would get shipped first. This might not be a request from the BVB team to Blackbox, but it just makes sense. It would be most efficient to package single orders first, then progress to double, triple, etc. It sucks for those of us who ordered multiples, but I bet that's how they do it. @everyone the amount you added on to your order is not effecting your shipping date. We would never punish you guys for wanting to have even more fun! :) @Daniel Ziegler, everyone has to know you're dumpster diving, but you can hide what card you're taking from the pile. @Mike Selha the play mat is at the top of the box, so I doubt you missed it! Email us at <email> and we'll help you out! @Juan Nothing for me at this time (french country) Still waiting for the email... Did someone im Europe received It ?! Received 07/06/17 - Surprised my wife who was skeptical at first and then as she realized she was pretty good at it, we've been playing every night after we put our lil' one to bed! Thanks, a really high quality product! Where else can we post reviews on this?? Received 7/6, played for hours on 7/8. Incredibly fun. Took a couple of rounds to figure out strategy and first couple of games were long, but eventually picked up game speed. Thanks for a great game! Hilton I'm in Melbourne and still waiting for shipping notification?! Anyone in Australia received theirs yet? I still have no shipping information, and backer kit says ready to ship, and has for quite some time now. Ordered one copy to Pittsburgh PA. Got it. Played it. Love it! @OJ this isn't being shipped by Ship Naked...but rather Their (Cards Against Humanity / Exploding Kittens/Bears vs Babies) own Shipping/fulfillment company, Blackbox. still haven't gotten a shipment email yet. Still waiting. So my game is being held back for almost a month or possibly more (still no tracking info or anything), simply because I got 2 of BvB, instead of 1? Isn't that just down right freaking annoying... @vandeetz My experience with Ship Naked (and I believe that is who they are using here) is that they (Ship Naked) always wait until all single shipments are completed before moving on to those who order multiple copies, or have more complex orders (add-ons). Kinda upsetting that the box isnt big enough for sleeved cards (plus expansion) and the manual and game mat...I just tried and even with the plastic insert removed the box doesn't fit in the suspenders... @kyric interesting... I added a couple extra bvb sets and haven't heard anything. And when you see the picture of their shipping operation all the boxes are for single sets @vandeetz I have been wondering the same thing. I added on Imploding Kittens at the pledge manager. Ive asked twice, but, no response to if that would/could cause delays in shipping fulfillment. Any update on shipping for the UK? I've not had my notification yet and starting to get a bit worried When are the EU copies expect to ship? Is everyone who's getting them so far just getting single copies? I wondered if those of us that added multiple sets are getting shipped later. My sister, who backed after me and finished the survey after got her single set, and I'm still waiting for mine to ship Is the card taken during dumpster diving public knowledge since the discard pile is face up, or can someone take a card from the discard pile secretively? Literally just got mine about 30 mins ago. Excellent quality! Never got an email but that's alright. Excited to get a game in tonight! Hey my copy arrived today. Augusta, Georgia in the US. To be sure they are using good packing materials. A nice padded box much like a standard card box that the main game fits snuggly into. I didn't get a tracking number but I had noticed that my Backerkit account showed it as shipped yesterday and thought I had about a week to wait. To the creators- thank you for making this game. Oh, as it happens there *was* a bear in my yard on July 4. Received in Connecticut on July 7. That was a memorable unboxing. For EU is end of September?.... When is shipping sure in Hong Kong? I'm moving to South Africa in2 weeks...was hoping it would have been delivered by now!!!� Hi, quick question: Are you sending the packages by batches, right?, this batches are location based? When are you going to send packages to chile, it takes a while receive packages to here D: I still haven't gotten any shipping notification yet :-/ Received the game today. Totes excited! However, the playmat is missing. Or am I too much of a fart monster to find where it is located? I got my package yesterday and was super excited to play when I was looking at my cards and one is damaged. :( the front is peeling from the back. @Daniel, we're still shipping so don't worry just yet! You should receive an email very soon. Hoody hoo! I received mine today, a day ahead of the package tracking estimate. I can hardly wait to play my first game! Oh...and by the way? I am NOT a squishy fart monster! >:-( I have yet to receive any notification from black box about shipping. Who should I contact? Received mine today! What a wonderfully hairy game! I am crying tears of happiness. AND I VOW TO STOP THE BABIES. I will use that special anti-baby condom again and again to ensure no babies are created by me. I even have a nice plastic sandwich bag for storage after the first use, because I do not think I will be able to get it to go back into the package. We will see though. Got my Tracking Info Today! Scheduled for delivery Next Wednesday! Woot! If all US orders should be delivered by mid-July (end of next week, or the week after if you're saying middle-ish of July), shouldn't tracking info be sent out already? How far before receiving the game is tracking info being sent out? @Justin Whoops! I misspoke. If you tie with another player in a battle, then both monster armies and babies will stay on the board--nothing happens. Hi, I've asked the support team about the ETA to Spain, this is the answer: Thanks so much fur reaching out! We start shipping to Spain later this month, so keep an eye out for a shipping notification email around then. You should have your paws on a game by the end of August, if not sooner! ᶘ ᵒᴥᵒᶅ Got mine yesterday. WOW so awesome worth the wait. Now it's time to eat some babies! Arrived today in Fort Dodge, IA. Huzzah! Nope not a tie with the babies a tie with a player where both your monsters are stronger than the babies but have the same point values. I received my game today. It did not disappoint! The care and final touches that went into the final product is amazing. To those who have not received - be patient as you will not be disappointed! @Nicholas everything is shipping in batches. We promise we haven't forgotten about you. You should get an email very soon! I'm in the us and did my survey really early, still no tracking number. Played the game twice over a mini vacation this past weekend. Anything that got confusing for us was resolved by looking through either the instruction booklet or FAQ sheet provided with the game. The gameplay information is pretty well laid out in the provided materials. It seemed like the hardest part for first time players was developing strategy on when to provoke the babies which im sure will change when replayed. @Nicholas thats for worldwide. If you filled out your shipping confirmation survey in time and live in the US then all orders should have been delivered by mid July. Is that end of September world wide or US? I'm moving in August and if I knew it could possibly be that late I would have sent it to a family members house. I just got mine today. So, to anyone saying you can't fit the expansion in there... That's wrong. You literally just place them on top of the other cards.everything fits and the box closes. 10 legs, 14 bodies and 29 heads. @Stephen that's the absolute latest it would be. We're planning for much much sooner and working on an update about it right now! Seriously, end of September? So those outside the US shouldn't hold our breath on getting it anytime soon? @Reyom if Exploding Kittens is an indicator shipping will never be "over" (We're still waiting on a couple thousand people to claim their game), but for everyone who has filled out there information we expect shipping to be complete by the end of September at the latest. No need to panic just yet; we're shipping out hundreds of games everyday :) @Luke and @Enrique Don't be scared! It's the special Kickstarter Backer Head and a special Thank You note from us. @Justin if you tie with babies in a battle then nothing happens. Monsters stay on the board and babies go back into the pile to battle another day. It's in the FAQ instructions if you ever need to double check :) Is there an estimate of when shipping will be completed? I know you guys have a lot to do, just wondering on when I should actually start to worry about not receiving that shipping notification. Got mine the other day in DFW. Love the packaging! The invoice was hilarious! Got mine in PA. Even better than expected!! Fantastic work guys! Super smooth project. I opened my "thanks" envelope without hesitation. I sent an email to you guys with concerns about my order and when it would arrive. You referred me to an address for your fulfillment partner, but an email sent to them bounces back as address unknown. I reported that to the <email> address but haven't gotten a reply. How can I find out the status of my shipment? Never mind! Was expecting a big rolled up one like normal. Disregard my dumb question! Is the play mat shipping later? Every time I come to check on progress I feel more an more spoilers in the comments. Please stop telling us that don't have it all the cool extra shit.. Got the game yesterday in MN. Even two days earlier than FedEx had for the date. The weight of it and some shaking says it another card, but I'm too uncertain to open it... I have the same question too Luke. Anyone brave enough to open the envelope? Hey, got my box today, thanks! I'm wondering though, what's in the small brown envelope that says 'THANKS'? Mad creative geniuses! Thanks for the epic experience! 8) Hello! Got my copy yesterday! Totally awesome!! My wife and I were playing and we provoked an army and it turned out we both could defeat the army and we both had the same amount of points. Who wins in this scenario? Hey everyone! I am back today to answer any questions you have. I see Elan has already addressed a lot of concerns, but if theres anything else, please throw them at me. I can't discuss your individual orders through Kickstarter, so if you have any questions about that, please email us at <email> I think everyone needs to cool down. Yeah, it's sucks not getting it right away, but these guys are busting their a$$es to get it to every backer as fast as they can. Based on the comments I see, it looks like there wasn't a lot of rhyme or reason to who would get it first... If their last update was truth laid out with the traditional sarcasm they have, some things didn't go as smoothly as planned. I know I wish I got it sooner, but I don't think these guys bamboozled anyone out of their money. Nor do I think that they are ignoring the thousands of backers waiting. If every day, I see 2 or 3 people posting here saying that they received it, it proves that they are working on it. I got my box today in RI, USA. Loved the silly comic strip invoice! Hello, just wanting to check in on the overall shipping status. I'm scheduled to demo/GM the game at a local event at the end of July, so while there is plenty of time yet I would love to confirm if I will actually have the game in hand at that time :) This is the second time that I have backed something on Kickstarter. The first one fizzled and I lost my money. It made me think of Kickstarter being a big Ponzi scheme. It looks like this is going to be the same way... I just got my game yesterday. I am in Florida. for those having tracking issues, my tracking from Fedex was not very reliable as the date changed a couple times and then once it got to my city USPS didn't offer any further tracking. With that said the game did finally arrive and i am quite pleased with the entire product. Where's my tracking this is upsetting. me now. Can't even get any support This has probably been asked before, but is there a timeline for shipping to European backers? Haven't seen anything yet. Got my Bears Versus Babies Yesterday. The odd part is that I called my dog a Squishy Fart Monster well before this game came out. I'm still waiting for tracking too, I'm in the contental US. still no shipping information @Elan I really appreciate you saying that, thanks. I know I'll love the game, and I don't mind the wait. It will be well worth it! In every other way the campaign has been great fun, and I'll always back you guys. I really hope you can find a quick and easy way to let backers who might be in the dark know what's going on. @elan* autocorrect @ethan just popping in to say nicely run campagin. You guys have been on point and regularly responsive. When I get my copy I'll be excited. Thanks tl;dr The lack of direct email communication/apology is upsetting. Also, could you send targeted emails with future shipping updates for those who have not received their game/shipping notice? Hi there! I've just received an email back from support saying that UK shipping wont start until August for delivery in September. Given the last update's optimistic theme, I think you guys have been very unfair. It would have been easier to swallow the delay had you been upfront at that point. I wouldn't even have known what was happening if I hadn't emailed support (which I've only done as I've seen so many people with copies of the game). Why were you not upfront about the timeline for UK deliveries in the update last month? Why did you not email backers from the countries with a later estimated shipping date to let them know what was happening? Most importantly, what do you intend to do to remedy the grievances of those who must wait longer for their game? I have to say I'm not overly upset with the delay in shipping, it is the lack of communication, with an update tantamount to a lie that has upset me so greatly. I wasn't even offered an apology when told my game (and how many others?) wouldn't even be shipping this month. This really is not, in any way, what I would have expected from an Elan Lee project. Got mine on 1 July (Saturday); unfortunately it was at the Post Office, and didn't get picked up until Monday, the 3rd. It's been played. It is silly. Mechanic for ties still not obvious, even with the FAQ: if N of M players beat the nefarious babies, *and* if the N players are tied, do their monsters still go away? The wording on this case is not clear. Furry box is a hoot, as was the semi-custom invoice/packing slip. Classic. Would it be unusual to have not received any emails yet? I'm certain I filled out the address form but I'm starting to get a bit paranoid here. Do add-ons slow down your arrival of game? I added on imploding kittens, does this move me later in the shipping queue? Backer #9,282 here. Still no email, nor did I get one from Blackbox (at least not since early March when my last archive kicked in). :( @weinerdog did you receive an email from Blackbox? Could you email us at <email>? We want to look into this. @Kevin - might show without a notification. Mine was in the mailbox today and I never received a tracking number or anything. @Kevin shipments are still happening! Our distribution bears are packing as quickly as they can and hopefully you'll have your paws on the game beary soon! Are we still waiting on shipment notifications? Have yet to receive a tracking number. @Brooke Whoah, that does sound like like a bad year. Hopefully we can make it and a little furrier beary soon. We're still shipping, so don't worry, your package isn't lost! :) I've not gotten my shipment email nor a package :( I know ya'll follow through unlike certain kickstarters *cough olo/ono, mont notebook cough* but i like mail that's not bills or the "congratulations, you're now uninsured AND unemployed" mails I've been getting since this month. in other news, 2017 sucks @Kyle when we were playtesting we kept running into issues, and one of the solutions was to cut the card count down to 107. We found that those 5 cards weren't necessary to the game, and were actually causing a few problems by being included. And by removing those (seemingly small) five cards, we were able to include a play mat into every box. We hope you find it an even trade! :) Hey @Molly! I'm so sorry to hear about your ankle; I hope it heals quickly. I completely understand your frustration, and we're trying to remedy the communication issue by being in the Kickstarter comments more. With over half the games sent out, we're wary to make an "official update" as that'll send a mass email to *everyone* causing further confusion. We'd prefer to handle this on a case by case basis. Hundreds of games are being packed and shipped every day so hopefully you'll get your confirmation email very soon. Thank you for your support and patience! Our distribution bears are working as quickly as they can. Kickstarter says 112 cards but the box only has 107 (not including the kickstarter exclusive), any reason or the cut in cards? Received mine today. Everything looks great! Good job keeping us updated and having these out on a timely manner! @Dale our support representative, Kellee, is emailing your right now! Still no confirmation email? I feel like everyone should have now since the previous post was 'you'll get it by July'. At this point another backer update should be posted. Twitter & FB should only be used as additional/supportive media (we don't all use them!) and more freebies should be sent to those still waiting for overdue product. This was a HUGE campaign $$$, there's no excuse for this lack of communication or the delay. I'm so disappointed in kickstarter this and another game campaign are excessively. I had wanted both for my vacation at the end of last month. Vacation ended early because of a broken ankle. Still no games when I got home. So, I have a concern. About a month ago I was assured BEFORE sending out parcels, there would be a confirmation email to allow us to correct our address. I moved about a month ago, and need to change my address. I am concerned to hear many folks are now getting their packages, some with no notices being sent. I have the correspondence to show that I was told to wait for the e-mail to correct my address. I am optimistic that it is still coming, but would like some confirmation that it is going to come to the correct address (I cannot easily check the old address as it's in another state.) Ahem....I received my game today along with a nasty hurtful comic. You sirs can expect a swift and stinky letter from the Squishy Fart Monster anti-defamation league soon! We here at SFMad find your crude humor hurtful and in poor taste, I have many bear friends who have told me I smell rather not horrible. Ashley, thanks for answering our questions! I just sent in a status query to the email address you posted. Thank you Hey @Jim, we can't give out your order information through Kickstarter comments. We are still shipping, but international countries' time tables vary. For specific timeframes please email <email> and our reps Kellee and Jay would be happy to help you out! :) I know you guys have a lot of people to get back to, but if I could get any tracking info that would be awesome. Thank you Ashley! Can't wait for the game to get here! @Brian we're doing our best to remedy that now :) Thank you for the feedback. While that may be true, you should not have left your backers in the dark who have relied on the comments section. The emails have not been very frequent or forthcoming with information other than a very general shipping announcement after a period of radio silence and not everybody uses social media. just a thought for the future. Just to be clear, the reason we've been moving the conversation to Facebook, Twitter, and email is because we have the ability to interact with you directly there and get your attention when we reply. Unfortunately, Kickstarter doesn't have the interface to make @someone effective. We'd never leave you hanging on purpose :) Please let me know any other questions you have! @Andre I found your email, it looks like our rep Kellee sent a reply but I'll reforward it too you right now. Please let me know if you don't receive it and I'll do my best to start some smoke signals and gather carrier pigeons ;) @Ashley thank you for your feedback. I wrote an email to that address last week, still no response. @Brendan thanks for the feedback! We love hearing how everyone experiences the game. We'll keep your thoughts in mind for possible expansions in the future. In the meantime if you want to test any of your theories out please let us know how it goes! @Morgan Shipping is still happening and you'll receive an email from Blackbox as soon as your order has shipped. If you live in an International country please email us at <email> and we can give you a more specific time table! @Brian Thanks for summing that up! I will do my best to address everything and then please feel free to ask any follow up. 1) Shipping is happening in the US first. We're a little over 50% through ALL shipping and International orders are starting very soon. I can't give an exact time table, because it varies from country to country. So if you would like a specific date please contact <email> and we will let you know on an individual basis (however, there is no need to panic just yet, we're shipping batches out everyday and working as hard as we can to do so). You will receive an email from Blackbox when your order has been shipped. 2) We had a similar issue in playtesting with a lack of heads (which double as individual monsters so you really really need those). We adjusted, had the reverse issue (less torsos), and thats why we added in the dumpster dive option. it's all a matter of strategy, and depending on how you play should not be an issue. I hope this clears some things up! Let me know any other questions you have Backers! Got the game last Thursday (Illinois), After a couple play troughs with 2 and 4 players here are some things that I wish were different gameplay-wise. First, I don't think all the parts should have the same point values (all arms are 1, all legs are 2, etc,..). There should be arms worth 3 and some worth 1. I think hoping to pull the best arms would make drawing more exciting. Also with the tools and hats, all the hats do the same thing and all the arms do the same thing. Make different hats do different things, i think that would add some variety. Hey Ashley, I'm sure many of us are wondering about when we'll get our packages and shipping information? Hi Ashley. Just combing through the comment history, there are a number of questions that have been left unanswered for quite awhile now. What order is the shipping process going in right now? What are the estimates on shipping to areas outside of the United States? Any plans on remedying the torso issue those with the game have addressed (and why was this not seen during play testing)? Hey everyone! I'm Ashley I work on the Bears vs Babies team. I'll be here all day to answer your questions or do my best to point you in the direction of someone who can. If you'd rather speak to someone directly/be alerted when there is a reply you can email us at <email> What's on your mind backers? No news here in Canada, backerkit tell me "Ready to ship" during the last weeks :s @strogar so what you're saying is you don't like it? Those who have received it, I know Black Box has been listed as the shipper, but what's the return address? I have a box coming from Santa Ana, CA tomorrow that shows shipped from "Dot Direct." Could it be Bears vs Babies? Received ours in Washington state (backer #49,492). It's a blast to play! LOVE the box - it's amazing! I wish the NSFW cards would have a slot for them in said box but no luck there. We ended up placing them under the tray insert so they are all kept together but they can be stored separate. The top of the box doesn't slide down all the way due to this but it is still solid. Still no shipping notification, no info here and sadly no answer to any mail. :-( the core game does in fact only have 107 cards as listed on the FAQ sheet included with the game (also seen in the PDF instructions page 33). the March 27 update says the game will only have 107 cards, previous updates specified 112 cards like the campaign page lists, although a playmat was included with the core game there does not appear to be a mention that 5 cards would be dropped for the playmat. . <url>#1,600 here and although I've seen others in Pennsylvania with higher numbers receive theirs....I know it's a random method of shipping which ..I dunno seems both random & kinda inefficient at the same time. ..that being said...I second the idea of maybe sending out an accompanying "torso" pack. Would have loved to receive my game prior to going on vacation but....looking forward to playing it soon. Well, 71k has his, but 21k, and I don't even have shipping details yet. It's really frustrating to fill shipment details nearly a month ago, expecting it around the end of June, and not have any details in July. Not to mention the fact I'm sitting in that "ROW" group, so shipping takes an extra 3 weeks anyways. So would it be too much to ask to get ours shipped first so we all get it at about the same time. Then again, seems like US alone is having quite a mixed bag on shipping. Guess the ball got dropped on shipping. At first I was thinking, "gee, so many orders", but 85k, Exploding Kittens was over 200k backers, and it shipped so much more smoothly. So that's disappointing. I wonder what went wrong. What would really be nice, is some transparency. For those of us who don't want to follow a facebook, it really feels like we've been ignored on the updates, because they're not posting here. Twitter all feeds back to Facebook. Feeling pretty disappointed here, mostly because there was the "We're making out estimated delivery, June! Give us a pat on the back" and here it is July and I've not even got an email or an update. If it was "It's slow going" or "We're getting there, it'll just be an extra month or two", that'd be cool, but now I've been going "You guys ready to play this, it'll be here early July" and nope... Just got my tracking email at 9:02PM CDT. I am backer #71,007, located in Iowa, USA. I checked the tracking number through FedEx, and found out that they had received the shipping info on June 14th, but did not receive the package to ship until yesterday (03-Jul). Huh. Maybe mine really did land behind the vending machine. Mine arrived yesterday in Maryland. Great quality cards, may, box & instructions. Thanks! So it's pretty much confirmed that they are shipping out slowly first to the US, and then to Canada and the UE followed by RoW in following months? Why was this not mentioned at any point? when are they expected to ship them out? and when should i be worried that i haven't received my shipping confirmation yet? I for sure filled out a survey and am concerned that i have no e-mail with shipping info Wasn't one of the stretch goals to be 112 cards? I only got 107 instead plus the backer head. @Darwin the game is still playable as it is. As someone else mentioned, you can dumpster dive to get a torso out of the discard pile, not to mention that you can play just a head to your monster armies. It would be a lot better with more torso options though. I didn't even know it had started shipping yet, lol. I'm in Atlanta and haven't received anything. Are they going the "no tracking" route? I'm going to assume the shipping was random because a backer in the same city as me has their copy and I've yet to receive a tracking number. No shipping notice here yet. Several friends in Atlanta have it already. Nothing in Texas that I know of. I is sad :-( One way to fix the torso problem is to use the ability to pick through the garbage and grab one that was used on an old monster. Granted they should have added more and more arms and change up the weapon abilities and points on the cards. The game is fun but severely flawed. Still waiting, but no point in letting everyone know that. So instead, I want to ask about the "torso" issue some people are having. I see that there were playtest rounds outside of the backers immediate circle. How come this issue was not encountered during playtesting? It seems like quite a few backers are experiencing this issue and it actually takes away from the gameplay. So what seems like a common issue that impacts the game negatively that wasn't addressed during testing. Are people just exaggerating the effects of this issue or did something go wrong during the testing phase? Also, if this is a serious issue, will it be addressed in the form of an expansion or extra torso set for sale or free? I really can't get over that this project was super successful and instead of improving the gameplay (and in this case better testing), we get a furry box that doesn't go together with the other games in my pile. Backer 26316. Still nothing... Backer #6,894 and still no confirmation.... Backer 53,132 got mine in CA on Saturday. -crickets- Got it in pennsylvania today Backer #54,469. No shipping information yet :/ Backer 40,758, USA. No info regarding my game. No email regarding shipping info, yet. Waiting also. Kind of concerned everyone says the game is lacking in some areqs as well like torsos amd such. But i wouldnt know since my copies havent arrived yet. Still no shipping info for me. backer #16,534 Manitoba Canada Still listed as ready to ship. No tracking. New Jersey I expected more of you. With exploding kittens there was more feedback from you, there was tracking. Now i get nothing Where my tracking email I like the game, but agree with the lack of torsos.. gets frustrating some times.. Expansion?!?! Having played a few games now, I can say that while the game is fun and entertaining, it really feels like is lacking body parts. A severe lack of torsos means that you will often find yourselves with useless heads. There is very little variety in arms as well. That said, the artwork is great (if there was ever a question). The card quality is good. The play mat is excellent. The box is a conversation starter on its own Mine shows "label created" on June 14. Not shipped yet and no estimated delivery. Here in the US in Utah. This seems to be going slooooooow. I sent an email to the team asking for an ETA on shipping to New Zealand, they said beginning to mid August. Looks like they are shipping all the US orders first before beginning international orders. That sucks, but will just have to be patient... Hi there Bears vs Babies team! Unfortunately, circumstances are forcing me to relocate, and I need to change my shipping address. Is it still possible to do that? Any ETA info for Europe? Backer 26.929. Spain. No info yet Just received and played the game! Thanks for such a beautifully produced, hilarious set of cards and paraphernalia. The one thing my friends and I noticed is that there seems to be not enough torso cards for monsters, and not much variation in point values between body parts (everything is 1 to 3) and tools (all -1, all same effect). We tended to have too many heads (almost pointless to play without torsos) and no way to attach arms or legs. Thus, without the critical torso, very little opportunity to differentiate with interesting new monster builds (other than the fabulous pictures and flavor text). As far as we could tell, all players had about the same tactics and strategies. Anyway, thanks for such an awesome (furry) box set! I'm looking forward to playing it with many more friends. It's now July and I still have no shipping information. @Katherine Wilson I'm from canada too, also, I participated in another kickstarter that's supposed to ship in july and they decided to ship internationaly first and then finish with the US. I'm guessing it's just a matter of making the total shipping of everything faster or else it would be even longer if they decided to ship in the order of backers. Wondering the same thing as you Bill. Backer number 2,077, in California. Still nothing. Are these being fulfilled in backer order or by region or random? Still not a peep from anyone since the "starts shipping today" announcement 12 days ago. Backer 11,991 in NY. Someone if France or at least Europe got news? reading older comments, talking about not shipping to Canada until July or August - wtf?? why is it we pay the big bucks, just like our southern neighbours, and yet, we get to wait at the back of the outhouse? Vancouver Island, BC Canada Still waiting to get shipping notification. Anyone from BC hear anything yet? Just got my shipping notification this morning in WI. Received mine yesterday, New York. Amazing job guys, love it Got mine on Wednesday and it was a blast to play!!! Thanks Back 18,488 WI. Nada on this front as well. I received mine in Brigham City Utah Yesterday. Any word on Utah backers? Got mine today!!! Thank you so much!! No update either, NY No update as of yet. Backer #69740 living in LA. Just got my shipping notice for delivery to VA. @spencer - No shipping notice yet for me. Calgary. AB. Forgot to mention. I'm in New York Mine actually arrived a few days earlier than the tracking suggested. Love the packaging and details. The little extras were a nice touch. Very reminiscent of Exploding Kittens. BlackBox is doing the shipping so the only option for support with delivery would be to contact them, obviously they will not monitor or read comments here... would also recommend registering with FedEx to get notices anytime a package is scheduled for your address, it looks like this one is being done with FedEx SmartPost, which means they hand it off to USPS for delivery. . <url>"starts shipping today" announcement and not a peep from anyone. Just got my shipping email from BlackBox! Deliver to MA is set for July 10th. Pretty excited. I know the backer survey is locked but I recently moved and need to change my shipping address. I haven't received tracking info so I was wondering if my address could still be changed? watching a video unboxing on youtube by "Garcia games and things" mine still says "ready to ship"......is that bad or is that ok? Received mine in NH this past Wednesday. Looks awesome and can't wait to try it out! Got mine today. Opened the box, found the envelope inside and instantly said "So this is the thanks I get." Still no shipping confirmation yet, and I'm moving soon. Wish I didn't have to lock in my address so early. I assumed that meant I had plenty of time for it to arrive but I guess not. Received mine earlier in the week. Marking project complete. I'm a backer right in Los Angeles, but I was backer 79504, so I'm guessing they may actually be going in ordernof pledges....maybe? Hi, I Haven't got any shipment mail or tracking number to see where My order might be, any clues? Cool, looks like "Shipped by end of June" should actually have been "Shipped to the US by end of June and screw you if you live anywhere else." Wouldn't mind but the last update suggested that we should all be getting a shipping notification by now and got me all excited, and I have precisely nothing. Somewhat frustrating... @All, is anyone else having problems with the shipper not delivering? The day it was sent out to be delivered to my home it was scanned "undeliverable" by the carrier minutes after leaving the post office. Yet I received my actual mail that day. Now its been three days and the rracking has all but ceased and the last update was that it was being returned to the shipper. So I have gone to the post office two days in a row to see if it was there and nada. They can't even figure out qhy it was scanned the way it was and so early. Frustration! Just got mine yesterday. I won't spoil anything but just opening the box was a blast. Really put a smile on my face. Thank you for being so awesome! Shipping confirmation in Kansas, but looks like it won't arrive till next Wednesday! Got mine here in central Maine:) love it so far �� So the last update was a joke/lie for most backers.. it is a shame, 3 months delay for a relative "simple" card game.. @Wim Moes I emailed CC about a week ago and got a reply saying EU will be September :( at the earliest late August.. sad day.. very sad day indeed.. Still no crying babies and roaring bears in the EU.... delivery in June? Not in 2017 for most backers.. ETA for Australian shipments? No notification. I added on Imploding Kittens. Would/Could that cause a delay in shipping? Got mine today in North Louisiana, Never got an email or any notice. Just got mine. Every bit is awesome, can't wait to play it. I have not received any notification :( I was hoping to get my game by July 1st. I'm guessing since I haven't gotten anything in the email saying mine was shipped, that isn't happening. Just got my game here in Tucson, AZ The furry box looks amazing, love the personalized card and comic. Thank you, can't wait to get this to the table on Saturday! Did somebody in canada receive their game ? Anyone in the UK/EU received theirs or a shipping notification? if I could get any tracking info that would be awesome. Yay I haves its, its minezes!!! I was a little concerned as I hadn't gotten an email with tracking information, but today my Bears vs Babies was waiting for me at the mailbox. Don't fret if you don't have a tracking number, just get excited it will be delivered soon. My FedEx tracking info has been sitting at "Label Created" since 6/14. Is that the same for anyone else? Just got a shipping notice in Maine, of course the tracking says it's going to take for friggin ever. "..they start shipping to Canada at the beginning of august..." Laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaame. Thanks to the people below for the update about Canada shipping. I guess no need to keep hunting for email notifications for a bit yet. I'll just pretend I never read the last update. :D (Even though I'm still peeved they suggested people called "Sally" would be up front on the shipping list. :P ) @RIP BLACKBOX packages it. FedEx ships. If yours is like mine then FedEx will hand it off to USPS for delivery I received my shipping notice today from Black Box. Super excited! I just checked my email after posting the last comment, and lo and behold, there was my shipping notification! Did anyone get theirs without getting a shipping email yet? Just curious. (I haven't gotten email yet and was wondering if I'd randomly come home one day and it's waiting for me...) This is one of the best KS I have backed yet. I have a couple I have backed that are YEARS behind schedule, with no real communication. This is as smooth as I have seen a KS run. Who is the packing and shipping company? Is there contact info for them? A few days or even a few weeks past the estimate is nothing to get upset about. Try waiting 3 YEARS (KS funded in 2014) for a card game that will very likely never be made or delivered. Relax and stop crying about not getting a shipping notice In a recent update, they specifically said there would be two roll-outs. If you don't get yours on the first, it'll be sent on the second. Gotta' read the updates more carefully. And they've sent 20 of them so don't get your panties in a twist!!! With that said, we've played two rounds so far and we've had a blast. Thanks again! Got mine yesterday. Game is gloriously fuzzy and looks like it will be a fun and goofy game to play. The personalized comic was an amusing touch. Well done. Arrived yesterday!! Great quality and art. The personalized receipt art was funny and unexpected. Thanks! Mine arrived just the other day, wanted to say "thank you" again, for yet another fantastically funny game. I look forward to whatever you do next. ^_^ My co-worker just got theirs but mine hasn't come yet, looks like they will be making the June deadline for most people. Hippoeater, and do most kickstarters release updates the month of their expected release and say theyre still on schedule? Cause im talking about that. Its not like they missed the original expected month and released an update where they told everyone 'sorry guys, the original expected date isnt do-able', they specifically said at the beginning of the month during the update that they're still going to make the deadline...and theyre not. @Kyle Zimmerman, man I dunno if this is your first kickstarter or what...but you can't be too mad at them when most kickstarters don't ship till months after their original launch date. Arrival.... inspection of merchan..... oh dear gods what have I done? What Have I Done?! Heh, this is going to be funny as all blazes. Well done, @Creators. Although the whole "Erbs are the worst" was a bit harsh... XD No email about shipping, two days left in June. Guess that part about them not missing their deadline was not true. Really disappointed in the company and their lack of communication (maybe this will change when I inevitably get what I paid for)... Got mine today in Ohio! Amazing job guys! Absolutely love it and can't wait to play! :D Got mine today in Maryland! Best invoice ever!! Excited to bust it out next game night. Got mine in today....love the insulting personalized comic No email about tracking my fedex has mine as "pending" for a week, any ideas? Woke up to my shopping confirmation email for Georgia. Woo hoo! Got mine in Wisconsin today. It's awesome!!! I wish I could post some pics of some of the expansion cards. Some of you will find them inappropriate but man are they funnier than hell! Thanks guys!! We're playing tonight!! Received today in Arkansas! @David Hutchinson I didn't receive it yet but I got a response to the e-mail they sent me. Basically, they start shipping to Canada at the beginning of august. Backer 3419, in Western Canada. Anyone in Canada receive it yet? Received mine yesterday, Seattle area. What a delight! Can't wait to play it again - although it won't be as much fun as playtesting with The Oatmeal himself was! received mine late last night. i opened the box and it... it was... it was glorious Anyone in the Minneapolis area get a shipping notification yet? Still waiting :( Gameplay video is here: <url># today. Should be here by this weekend. ^Cheetah Cub I haven't received mine yet, but a member of my game club has, so I got to play it tonight. It's really good quality. Harder to win than I thought though. A lot depends on when someone pokes the babies. The artwork is awesome. Mine has arrived! Though I did not receive an email about it Arrived in Cincinnati! Awesome packaging!!! I've got Bears! I've got Babies! I've got both in one fuzzy package! Thanks! I have begun to wonder what I did to offend the Kickstarter shipping gods, as this is the 2nd Kickstarter I am watching where I am near the end of the shipping queue.... Arriving in Chicago this Friday! Got my shipping notification!! Scheduled for delivery Monday, in Rochester ny My tracking says the bear has arrived, and i'm still stuck at work, :((( We are at S-plus-seven-days. It is quiet in Iowa -- too quiet. The babies are planning something, I know it. If only the reinforcements I requested would arrive. Alas, there has been no contact from Bear Command. All I can do is wait, and hope that the bears are on their way. My shipment says it was sent back due to address (though I am in both houses through 7/1) Would it be possible to send to new address: 8905 Lee Rd Brighton, MI 48116 Still waiting for tracking info in Spokane, Washington @Steven Yeah i got that part. I just thought that there would be regular provoke cards for each color baby. @blas Thanks! @marshall happy bearday! Today's my bday. Was hoping to get it by now :( Received in California yesterday evening in excellent shape. Thank you so much for the game- we can't wait to play!!! @magdiel There is only 2 wild provoke cards. It says so on the back of either the instructions or the FAQ Still nothing for me yet either. I am still hoping to get it before Independence Day so I could take it to the party! Good to see people are getting their games. Sadly I'm one of those that haven't received tracking info yet. Hopefully soon. Received my Copy in Chandler AZ. Everything is in perfect condition, great job guys! Received my game in Pennsylvania. Love the shipping invoice. I think it's the only time I'll hang on to one. My coworker got tracking last Friday and received his game today. Where as I have yet to see any kind of tracking. We're in SoCal. I have a question for anyone that has received their game. How many Provoke cards did u all get? I only got 2 WILD provoke cards. I have notification and all, but it seems to have stalled in Kent. And tracking is not updating. Either Fedex or USPS dropped the ball it appears. But, it's only a day or so on the delay, should be fine. I look forward to Bears. I have a feeling I will need the laughs. for the ones who got theirs, do you need to sign the box? Still waiting for a tracking number Oh, BTW, I can't say I ever got a confirmation number or tracking on shipping either...it just showed up in the mail, so everyone sit tight, they are making their way too you. I'm in Illinois. I just got mine in the mail yesterday...WOW you guys outdid it on the box and thank you for that little something extra special you threw in...LOLZ, everyone is gonna love that! Still no email of shipping here yet either. I'm in Ontario. I assume by the comments, that it's still on going. If there is a tie at the end of the game, the player with the most cards wins. If it's still a tie, players share the win. It's right in the FAQ that came with the game. Mine should be delivered tomorrow. Any suggestions on how to explain to my wife that i kickstarted a furry box full of cards? I can already see the look on her face when I exclaim "But Look! It's FURRY!" Just received mine and I am absolutely dying. It's incredible and ridiculous. So excited play Nothing for me here in Pittsburgh Haven't received a tracking number yet. Anyone in Ohio received theirs yet? Still no tracking number here either. Just got my card game this past Sunday and loved how you guys personalized it for each backer. Keep up the awesome work. @Josh Lee, there's another rule video on the site, if it's a tie between monsters and babies, monsters win. i'm not sure then if it's a tie between players on the end game. Still no confirmation email here in Indiana So what's the e.t.a. for European backers? Anyone in the EU received a tracking number yet? Hey guys, I'm not home right now but my wife and and playing. She's confused about ties (between monsters) and says there isn't anything in the rule book. Any thoughts? For people getting plastic covering for the cards. Where can I get some. Did you order online? Rich Ting, Same here...You and me are in the same lonely boat. Did not get shipping confirmation yet....grrr� Just got mine in Miami. Very well done. Got mine yesterday. Nicest thing I've gotten from a kickstarter so far with over 50 projects backed! Thank you. Mine arrived this morning. Portland, Oregon, USA. @Mister Jeeves My package did the exact same thing, but I live in Granada hills so my package still had some ways to go. Even so I don't see a reason as to why it had to go from LA to Chino. At least I got my package Got my shipping confirmation a few days ago, and just got mine today. Yeah, I filled my survey out day of too and still haven't received a shipping confirmation (which is disappointing seeing as how MANY already have the game). Its not impatience to ask for some clarification/transparency. To be honest it was kinda expected from last update and was avoided (the only serious part was that they are not going to miss their deadline...But they are). Mine is to be delivered Monday, but it says its at the usps in my city :/ hopefully I get an early surprise Just received mine in PA. Can't wait to play. Wonderfully packaged. Tucson, AZ here and it's arrived! It's hairy! It's AWESOME! Good luck everyone, I hope you get yours safe and soon! Woot woot just got mine shipped Just delivered Austin Tx Just got shipping notification. Package originating in Los Angeles Fed EX facility. Sent to Chino, CA fedex facility during transit. I live in Los Angeles. That seems counter productive fedex. Haha @kalib I would say no. The hats say they double the total strength of a monster and although the -1 tools have an effect (or affect, can never remember which one) on the strength it is more indirect Just received my package in New York! Very nicely put together! I am backer 11,883 and live in California and still no notification. I also completed the survey the day we got the notification and did not move. So, those that are worried, no need, I am sure they are processing as fast as they can. I am displaying my place in line to hopefully put others later in line at ease. No notifications yet... So if someone plays a party hat Wud it double the -1 as well? Or just the total power **This message contains a spoiler** @Lindsay I didn't get the NSFW package with a condom so it makes it easier to play with kids, but in one of the updates it looks as if there are multiple designs for the condom. Also, my backer exclusive card was the bear-o-dactyl. I'd assume they all are cuz of The Oatmeals video about the bear-o-dactyl I'm in California, where they have one of the shipping locations, and I haven't gotten any notice either. A little patience, people, FFS. There are 85k packages to ship. A truck can only hold so much... Game was delivered today! (though the tracking strangely still says it is in transit and USPS did not recognize the tracking no. even though it was delivered by USPS). Everything looks awesome! I love this box! I thought it was going to come in a plastic sleeve to keep the fur clean though. I could have sworn that was said somewhere. But there's always ziplock bags. I am just curious, but is the backer exclusive card and condom designs the same for everyone or are there different ones? Just curious. in Ontario, Canada. and nothing. anyone else in Canada get? None here yet I haven't, Kyle, so you are not alone. Blas, Nope, not there... @kyle spam folder? mine came from <email> Still have yet to get a shipping notice. Anyone else in the US not get one yet? All im seeing is people saying they got it. @pete Mine shipped through FedEx but was delivered through USPS I just got the shipping notice. To North Carolina. Backer #27,xxx Shipping via FedEx, expected delivery of Wednesday the 28th. Got mine delivered today, to Duluth GA ... the screams from the enclosed babies is quite stunning! Sorry just saw you are thanks @Alexander Are u based in US also? Anyone in EU get tracking number? got my shipment today at 3am, tracking says it shipped 6/22 from Sylmar CA, and will be arriving at 6/27 here in Las Vegas, backer # 10440, super excited! Got mine yesterday and you guys knocked it out of the park on the production! Looking forward to cracking it open to play with the fam. HI All, I live in Ireland and asked a rough ETA on my pledge and was told it could be late AUG early Sept.. so I guess EU backers wont be seeing any tracking numbers for some time yet. I added on imploding kittens in the pledge manager. Will that have any impact on shipping product to me? Backer 26,000 here in Utah. Just received my tracking number Has anyone attempted to contact them about what determines shipping? Lol I emailed them asking what the estimated shipping date for mine was and they said mid-July. Backer #79,308. Virginia backer 60,760, still no tracking info, usa Backer 26,978 from Canada, no tracking information yet. Imagine they will do the USA first. I'm about to move next week. What will happen if mine isn't shipped in time? If you look carefully at the last image in the update, you will clearly see that they are determining shipping order by explosion. If yours has not shipped yet, it is likely they are still looking for it after the blast. It probably landed behind the vending machine. yeah i did my survey on 4/3 but updated it on 5/9, i'm backer# 10440, so it's not backer #, not survey, not location, not whiny little comments, let's just assume it's random and wait patiently for the furry box, for the ones that got it, no spoilers please if they have a little surprise, haha Hmm ok, so I guess they aren't doing by survey fill-out date either.. Guess it's a crapshoot? @Todd I just got my game. Not sure exactly when I first did my survey, but I do remember when they gave the update saying we had 48 hours left to do the survey or we won't be in the first shipment, I redid my survey after those 48 hours hoping the survey would have been locked and that it would have meant they were close to being shipped. I thought it would have made my game come way later @Todd my survey was filled out April 3rd 8:50AM EST Anyone with shipping info know their survey date? No tracking number yet Backer 34,815, Survey on 4/3 Backer #59,903, receiving mine tomorrow in Tillamook, OR!!!!!! Yea before I got my email I was trying to find a trend to get an ETA for mine. I dont see a correlation between backer number or region. So maybe it really is random. Checked my tracking info and it shows shipped yesterday from Cali to arrive 06/28 at Florida. Also, my thought process comes from being super excited and in hopes that other excited fans find a correlation if there is one! Good luck! yeah, Oatmeal did say: "If you don't get a shipping notification right away, please be patient." Actually they did not want to let people know that Santa Claus was checking the backer list and told them who to deliver first...... It's called random, backer number has no impact. A shipping notices don't all go out simultaneously and only says that a label has been created/scanned, could be days before a package actually ships. @strogar, not sure if it's by backer numbers, mine is 10440 and i didn't get my shipping yet, steven on the otherhand backer #71781 got his shipping email on 6/20, maybe their just doing it randomly, lol Just got my shipping notification. Backer #7645 and I live in Michigan. Storgar, No Im saying that someone in cali got theirs yesterday, thats a completely different time zone. If they are on the florida region than I should be getting a shipping notification, and I clearly haven't . So again, unless they come out and clarify that thats the method they're using, you are wrong. Shipping company - "oh wait is that package for Kyle ? Better set that one aside because he complained on KS comments, let's deliver that one last...." "Better update the list of complaints to set aside those packages, scroll down the comment section." Yeah because Florida only has one zip code and only one area to deliver so you are right they must be going down the list by backers numbers.... Storgar, Thats not how this ones doing it then cause I (like Miguel Prada who just posted that they got their tracking info) live in Florida, and I have yet to receive my tracking/shipping info. And they dont seem to feel the need to explain how these are being sent out (in what order). So once again, disappointed. YESSS!!! just got my tracking info email! so Excited! Florida, backer number 25,xxx Shipping notification! @Bulblub, 85K games is probably inaccurate as folks may have ordered multiple copies. I myself ordered three. If they send all the games in the next few weeks they will be only one month behind the schedule, which is amazing for a Kickstarter campaign. I hope everything runs smoothly, 85k games are a lot, most campaigns struggle with way less shipping companies ship based on zip codes and regions not backer number or survey...cmon now. Backer 68875 and nothing, despite my love for bears and hate for babies. Clearly the creators are not weighing factors such as 'number of bear tattoos' in helping them formulate their batches. backer 39,XXX. no shipping info, but I'm in australia, so my guess is they are doing north america first Got my game today in So Cal. Love the personalized message inside the box. Thanks guys! To all that has been wondering about the card count in the box. There is 107 cards. Since we backed we get the special backer exclusive card. That means backers get 108 cards F Enderica, Just to clarify, there was nothing in the update that said/promised they were shipping all orders out by June. 'We're shipping them in batches, starting today and continuing over the next few weeks'. June is over in a week and a half so if we take 'few' to mean greater than one, they most certainly did miss their deadline and will not be shipping it out to all of us by June. Which is (at the very least) disappointing. They might be shipping in order as to when you filled out the survey Probably they are shipping throw sectors , they just start shipping yesterday and they promise the shipping in June so all we can do is wait Yea pledge # 23,892 and havent gotten an email yet. Not complaining, just super duper excited Maybe theyre shipping in reverse chronological order? Or Prime numbers first? Or anyone called Sally? Backer #18,280 in Michigan and nothing yet. I'm guessing they are not shipping in order. Backer number 69068 and still haven't gotten shipping info. Maybe they're annoyed that I asked for updates on here instead of facebook (I know, crazy thought). I just received an email with FedEx shipping confirmation from Blackbox. Shows my game was shipped yesterday and is scheduled to arrive next Tuesday (in Texas). Backer #74,473 @blas I'm backer 71781 and shipment info for mine was sent to FedEx 6/14. It has been on the move since 6/19, but I got the blackbox email 6/20 @trueflight Ok. That's good to know. Thanks @steven I think the company's name is listed as Exploding Kittens. That's why it comes up like that. It specifically says "your order from Exploding Kittens is on the way" and when you look in details it lists Bears vs Babies specifically. Just got a shipping notice from Black Box with a FedEx tracking number here in NY. Yay! Anyone got theirs shipped yet? if so what's your backer number? trying to figure out how many they ship a day so i can estimate when mine is, i have 10400 So, she didn't really drown? Does anyone else's blackbox say exploding kittens? Mine does and I'd assume they'd want their bears vs babies logo since it is the game that we're getting @Paul I'll admit, I took the update seriously until she drowned in her vomit Lol people taking that update seriously. Everyone knows it was babies who stole the plans since they don't want us training to kill them. I suspect the whole bears vs babies operation is a bust because of this. We're all screwed. The end is near!!! @DISLEX Blackbox, the company being used to ship bears vs babies was created by cards against humanities. Do you think they actually stole the master plans for the game? The Gold Standard of Updates! Holy cow, (or bear), what an update! Dislex, I really hope you're joking. If not, you need to lighten up. Have you seen the game you're backing? It's all about the laughs here. RIP Paul... And Carly's toilet. I have it on good authority that babies fart almost 5x what a normal person does. I have experienced this personally since November, as the new father of a baby girl. I think she's responsible for at least 5% of the methane emissions causing Global Warming today. So you might need to up your fart calculations by a factor of two. Can't wait to experience this game! What a ride! Holy flying bears batman. Best update ever. Very creative and freaking awesome. Love this company really looking forward to more projects. BEST .. UPDATE .. EVER! This is almost as good as the game I am sure! *sue Did the Cards Against Humanity crew really buy the plans!? Y'all really had to sure to get them back!? If so, what a bunch of A-holes. It's not like CaH is even an original game. It's just Apples VS Apples. This makes me want to never play Cash again. It makes me want to be extra sure I never support anything they may ever come out with. You are crazies! And I like it <3 OMG!! I DONT FART THAT MUCH!! WTF? Ok just a little � lol LMAO BEST. UPDATE. EVER. ^"Cheetah Butt" Oops! Forgot to add my tag ... sorry. I think I speak for everyone here when I say that explanation would have made up for a delay in the shipments. So worth it! I wonder how many times my tattoo has farted. ... Do tattoos fart? ... That is literally my favorite update ever! Thanks team. Can't wait to get the game! Hey Zem, how've you been? Thanks for the update. So glad to get my hands on the furry box :-D I received a FedEx "label created" notification on 6/15. The shipment looks to be a BlackBox shipment from California. Is this BvB? @Creator - Thanks for the update! So long as we seen a nicely drawn story about "shedding concerns" I'm looking forward to it. :) @Greg a pretty,pretty,pret-ty good update indeed. Best update ever!? 7-months!!!!! This game better be fucking amazing as I have backed over six other projects and have already received, used, and gotten sick of!!! S-E-V-E-N that's one more than six months!!!! Why must we wait in the dark to find out that this game is taking forever due to a fancy box that a baby could choke on!?!? Siete meses Woo hoo!!!!!! Just got my shipping confirmation that my game was shipped. Should be here in WI next Tuesday. It's not up to the backers to go to Facebook or other social media pages to get information on a project we backed here on Kickstarter. The Creators are responsible for providing updates here, not anyplace else. We should not have to chase information down. If you report the campaign to kickstarter they will reach out to the creators and remind them that they need to communicate with the backers. @Steven the thing is I wish we could hear that from them. The fact that we hear everything through other backers who find out through Facebook or other means is just kinda suck. I was super excited for this game and still am but also feel like a second class citizen compared to all the facebookers which just seems weird to me since I feel it should be the other way around since we helped fund the game. Overall I'm not worried, I'm sure I'll get my game. But the feeling of being ignored vs people on fb who might not have even backed is sad. @Steven - patience is definitely a good thing, however, some onus is on the Creators! They have never gone this long without an Update, so of course some Backers will get nervous. Its very easy to give regular Updates when a Project is going well. Much more difficult when you have to report problems, but that is part of the process. I've Backed too many Projects where the Creators got eerily silent when things started getting delayed (or worse). I'm sure its not a comfortable feeling for the Creators, but keeping 85,000+ Backers in the dark really isn't a viable solution and it leads to anxiety. They need to stop commenting on FB/Twitter/Instagram/MySpace/Whatever and make a Update so that ALL the Backers can be notified. You all need to just be patient. The Oatmeal and Elan estimated June for delivery but that didn't account for the faux fur. Also, the company making the game and boxes is what's holding everything back. Just be glad the the estimated delivery is pretty good and could still happen. Some kickstarters had an estimate that was way off. The game is on the way and that's the most important thing Where is the update and why is it so hard to just write a few lines to calm all the backers Got my survey over a month ago and and said "ready to ship". No word or package since then. Please give us an update. Thanks! I contacted support. Shipping Info will be released towards end of month. UK should get in August When are these shipping?! The question is why would you back the Kickstarter, then go out and try to buy a 3rd party copy after? Micah "Zem the Mattress" Philson, I know they're aware of them. Others on here are not though and the BVB team could EASILY release a paragraph update saying 'Hey everyone, the games are still expected to arrive by June (hoping here), any BVB games you see for sale are fakes and not up to our standards. Please save your money.'. Have they released any updates on when they'll be shipping to EU countries? Kyle Zimmerman, don't worry, they're well aware of the fakes. I talked directly to them I think before the campaign had even ended, or maybe within a month after it had, about 2 we'd found. They not only knew about them, but even had a couple versions sent to them by unhappy people who'd been scammed! They said they all played terribly and made no sense, of course. ;) Same as you, though, I wish they'd put out more of a warning to impatient backers about the scams. They did once with Exploding Kittens I think. Can't wait until I get to stroke the furry box Try signing up for backerkit website. It should find you pledge from your email. You check spam? Hi, emailed support, never received a survey. Backer from November 2016. Would love an update some time. Deep breath...... 5...4...3...2...1... I am patient. I can handle this wait. BUT ITS A FURRY BOX!!! no wait patiently.... THOSE BABIES NEED TO BE STOPPED!!! When is this shipping????? Updates? Not a fan of the furry box, no fur box is fine with me. Scott Hutcheson, They are most definitely fake. Sadly there is a huge fake/counterfeit card market that comes out of China (where most of the games are listed 'sold from'). I messaged the creators of the game last week hoping to spur them into releasing a statement or update on here so no one wastes their money on a inferior product...But as everyone can see, no such luck with that update. If they don't have the furry box. They are fake. Update please. May I know when is the copy of the game will be deliver ? I keep seeing copies popping up on eBay, chances are they are fakes. My baby is one week old today..... more ready for this game than ever! Eagerly awaiting the game. Weird, but we saw the game for sale in a store in Petosky, MI, back in May. Hey everyone, there should be an update coming soon. They posted on their Facebook page that they had received several pallets from the manufacturer. Keep in mind the original estimated delivery date was June 2017 so everything is still on schedule. If you're having trouble getting in contact with them try reaching out to them on Facebook or at <email>. I am admittedly more than a little curious how we went from games being "nearly ready to ship" in April, to radio silence for most of May and almost half of June (the suggested delivery month). I trust the creator, I'm not worried about him trying to run off with people's money or anything like that. I simply would prefer a little more transparency when there seems to have been some major setback. Update please Soooooo, whats the update? I emailed <email> over a week ago to say I'd changed address and ask what to do (since I haven't seen any shipping notifications, and when backerkit was locked I was still at my old address and assumed shipping was imminent). No response yet..... so I'm posting here to try to be seen. Never got my survey....how long do i have to wait to hear from support? @Lewis England....yep...the flame wars on that page was apocalyptic! Love mine but the rancor was intense...not helped by zero communication by creator. (Fidget Cube) Today is my Birthday. My wish.....an update! :-) can´t wait @Don Randall, don't get me started on the Fidget Cube debacle. We got them in the end! I sent an email- the response I got was..."We'll start shipping to the US at the end of July, so keep an eye out for a shipping confirmation email around then. You should have your paws on a game in August ᶘ ᵒᴥᵒᶅ " @Irene that's pretty reasonable I think. Thanks for sharing your wisdom :-) Door hinges? Nah that's not right... I sit here waiting for Elan or Oatmeal to give us an update on the shipping ordeal. My heart is a beating in anticipation, while my stomach butterflies seem to have constipation. Oh please Elan Lee, we cannot BEAR it anymore, I know we sound like BABIES, but we want that package at our door. Please give us just a small update or comment before we EXPLODE, Well, maybe not explode, but surely some will IMPLODE. Update us please, so our postal worker friends are no longer scared to approach our homes and apartments like they triple-dog dared. Time to try and relax, while we sit at our desks eating oranges and hitting F5 in hopes of a shipping update that says... DAMN IT...what rhymes with oranges... that says...SHIPPED! Has anyone received this yet? They said over a month ago that they had almost all of the surveys filled out and are sending out the first shipment but no word in over a month. I sent you guys an email letting you know I moved.. just doublechecking to make sure you got it. Thanks! Hey guys, lets get an update on the status of the game. It's been a while. Better yet....go see the "Fidget Cube" page If you think these people are impatient, check out the Dark Souls Kickstarter. Holy crap there are some impatient people on Kickstarter. It's not a store so it will ship when it's ready! I Kickstarted a project that has been shipping orders individually as they are completed, and it's been "shipping" for over a year now. Would you guys seriously rather have that? I'm in no hurry, this is kickstarter and many projects are still a learning curve for the creators. I will say, however, I do not use Facebook and would appreciate information updated here. This is where I found the project, this is where I should be updated on it. This co. Blows, just bought imploding kittens expansion and the only thing imploding was my wallet. Would get a refund at this point if I could for this bears vs bank account if I could. @Tommy S, You think that's offensive? @Pete Miller Saying that its fake would be enough. No need to be offensive... @Rob because I read some comments saying that the shipping date is different. They replied saying that I should be receiving mine some time in August. Hey all, the listings on ebay some are talking about are counterfeits. People have posted on FB and they are not good quality and apparently not really playable. I would save my money if I were you. Canada shipping isn't till August :/ I asked on their fb page about US shipping and they said at the end of this month. I also told them they need to send an update out instead of leaving backers in the dark. We'll see what happens. i sent an email asking about uk shipments and they emailed me back stating they start shipping eary august :( Can someone tell me when mine is coming � Also that box isn't furry, hence not the official box... but it could of been one of the playtesting boxes @Tommy S. Simple, the game on eBay is a counterfeit game that is of very low quality. If you get it, I've got some Louis Vitteon purses to sell you for CHEAP too. how it is possible, this game is available on ebay already and even cheaper? if i understand correctly, if i havent backet this project and just waited instead, i could possibly have it already at home for less money. last update was more than month ago already, facebook is no go for me @Irene what is the deal with UK posting? I emailed them to ask about delivery to the UK at <email> and they replied very quickly! You should try emailing them if you have any questions. When should I expect my delivery? I'm probably going to buy this game off eBay..... no updates... nothing... Update me plz.. as far as I know I backed the game on kickstarter and not on facebook.. so post info here instead on Facebook like some people say.. Still exited about this gem can't wait to get my hands on it. Even the box is awsome! So...later this month hopefully? Cool...can't wait! Any communication on here for the backers would be SO appreciated. Cause Right now I feel left in the dark. Oooo can't wait for this to ship!!! My backer kit says ready to ship.... Sooo maybe someone can press go? Look on the post from May 17 when someone specifically asks when they ship. The response was END of June for the first batch Not mad, but it would be nice if they focused more on posting and answering questions here instead of their FB. Seems like all kinds of backer related stuff is being answered on fb while it's complete radio silence here. I appreciate the people posting their comments from fb onto here but it would be nice if they showed us some love themselves. SO apparently the June date is just for US Backers... Canadian backers like myself will have to wait until beginning-middle of August for shipment. you can email <email> to see if you are included in the first round of shipping or not...and the comment said LATE June, not END of June. On FB comment they said they start shipping END of June Be patient people, reminder this isn't a store. Delivery says June, and it doesn't mean June 1st. @Jack I agree. Even if they are still sorting through everything and filling orders for those who updated their shipping address by May 5th an update would be nice. Just so we know how close we are to the first shipment I haven't received mine yet. I'm guessing that I haven't been forgotten. Waiting patiently! Well the delivery date says June. Yeah Josh Lee. If we had to have our addresses in by May 5th, how long can it possibly take!?!?!? Any one else impatiently waiting like I am ? @Destry I would email <email> So, when I did the confirmation I put in my work address because I live in the hood, and I'm more often at work than not. Everything was fine, until the CEO decided to relocate us to a different office building, two cities away. So... how do I fix this? It won't let me change my address because apparently "Shipping Info is Locked". u.u Oh gotcha @Morgan I believe the shipping starts in June Have things started shipping? I haven't received any info yet Has there been any tracking or estimated dates? :( Would everything be shipped at the same time even if we got imploding kittens or would it be shipped out sooner. Just the expansion pack for Imploding Kittens for my birthday - awesome !!! @Jason The cards are 2.5" X 3.5" They mentioned it in update 17 CARD SIZE QUESTION: This may have been asked many times earlier, but I didn't have time to read through all 13,119 comments.....But have we been told the SIZE of the cards? I'm sure many people (myself included) plan to sleeve these cards. ? mm x ? mm goddamit... my kickstarter is connected to my wife's email and I missed the survey........... TT_TT When would I be receiving my copy of the game? I know I won't be getting it with the first shipment TTTTTTT_TTTTTTTTTT Anyone know where the game is coming from? I'm excited for this game! Can't wait to play it Got an email saying they are about to be shipped. Can't wait! Shelby, 1) Check your spam folder. It could easily be in there. 2) Go to backerkit and find it: <url>` Man, I wish they could pin a comment so we didn't have to keep reposting these when people inevitably don't check if someone else asked an identical question. <url>` Liz, I'm going to leave the specifics to David, this is the stuff he knows that I don't, but I believe from what I've heard that if you contact <email> they can waive your shipping fee. Though you can also just check out if you feel like $3 isn't enough to worry about and in checkout from the backerkit, it should ask you for billing information for your add-ons and shipping if you're supposed to pay more than you pledged on the campaign. How do I add money to include shipping? I put $70 as my pledge for two games. Now they've taken $3 out as shipping so I'm going to lose $32 and have one less game if I can't figure this out? @Micah "Zem the Mattress" Philson: Hahahahaha I just pass the info devs send me by email. Nothing special in that. BTW I've been checking this on regular basis, so I'm still around here if someone needs more info or something. @Manan Kacheria: I believe I am restating the original F Enderica question accurately. We were notified that 107 cards (+ Mystery head card) were being produced. This total number conflicts with the 112 cards promised based on fulfilling the stretch goals. What happened with the 5 missing cards? @F Enderica What was your question? Seems to have gotten buried in the comments section. Can anyone please answer my question about the 107 card(originally 112) His, and really, I'm just used to doing it after so long because of doing it for Exploding Kittens. I'd say David Sánchez Cuenca should get that award even though he hasn't been here for awhile (not that there's been much to do for awhile) because he was here way more regularly and with way more details and answers than I could hope to have! Some honor for mica for her(?) patience to answer the same questions over and over again. Alison, as in the link to it that you were emailed? Otherwise, I'd say look in your email, or even email trash if that's what happened. You can also I think sign in through backerkit itself, but if nothing else works, <email> is always there. I'd try everything else you can think of first, though, but the support is very helpful and usually fast. The support for the add-ons shipping was FANTASTIC! They helped me out so much and SO FAST! I had 7 add-ons and shipping to Japan was really expensive, but they helped me out! LOVE THIS COMPANY! I think I may have deleted my pledge survey. Is there a way to get it resent? Shawn, get a few extra NSFW packs? Other than that, if it's not listed as one of the extras on Backerkit you can order, I don't think so. But I didn't look too closely at those extra things you can add onto your order, so maybe you could check there? Is there a way to get a few extra of the condoms to give as gifts? @Zach, Actually since it is Backerkit you should be able to edit your address for a while. Search your inbox for your link. Zach, <email> I need to change my address I will be moving! What do I do? After finally getting a response from a couple of piggyback-backers I emailed <email> about postage to Australia & was amazed to have a response within a couple of minutes. Most impressed. Lo and behold a just checked my email to see one that was sent yesterday... my mistake? weird. Anyway, credit apparently provided. Thanks I sent out an email 2 days ago to <email>, with no response as of yet. Anyone else who actually tried to resolve this shipping fiasco actually get a response from them yet? @Solomon: Check out a huge comment I made 3 days ago 1 Core Deck + NSFW Booster Pack - 15 dollar shipping add on same set 19 dollar extra????? @Stev0: IIRC, when making the survey in BackerKit, if you put the cursor over the CREDIT REMAINING note it shows a text saying: "Remaining credits go towards the project and are non-refundable". The problem isn't Kickstarter, it seems to be a Backerkit thing. So, if they fix it before May 5th, great. If not, I think getting extra money back worth a couple of mails, because it seems to be non-refundable. I am just going to NOT buy anything extra. Why should I go through extra steps to ask for money back when it should be fixed on the Kickstarter's end initially. @David Sánchez: Solo había pillado el 25+7 y ahora quería meter alguna copia más y por cada una eran 7 pavos más [o 10+ al meter el Exploding] y ahí es donde dije whaaaaaaaaaaat? Voy a calcular qué pedir y a ver qué me dicen, sí que me espero un poco de incremento pero no 7$ o 10$ por copia jeje. @Hol: Debe ser de las primeras veces que usan el sistema de BackerKit. Según me dijeron, está todavía "en pañales". Por curiosidad, ¿cual fue tu contribución? @Benjamin Popp: In the survey, just choose the add-on yo want. Remember to email support, in order to retrieve the extra shipping fees, the calculator will wrongly add. @David Sánchez: OK, vaya tela, ¿no les costaría menos calibrar la calculadora q responder 80K quejas? LOL. Bueno, voy a pensar lo que quiero y les mando mail explicando como dices, muchas gracias eh! How can i Pledge a second time the full Pledge Level? David Sánchez, you're awesome! Way more answers than I could possibly have and here way more regularly. I usually do what you're doing, but am not able to now, so thanks! ` Kevin, what Chirstopher said. ` Christopher "Bear" Adams, what you said! ;) ` GinjaNinja, I'm almost certain the fur is KS-exclusive, just like the meowing box was for Exploding Kittens, so it won't have to worry about shelves much at all. P.S: For non-spanish speakers, my previous comment explains how I managed to resolve the shipping fees problem. As said, email <email>. Explain your case (money pledged here, additional fee BackerKit says you owe, country, and any additional info you consider useful), and they will answer quick. At leats in my case, I had a email back in less than 20 mins, and with the 15$ covered for free. @Hol: Hice una contribución aqui en KickStarter de 80& (2 Cores, 2 NSFW y 10$ de gastos de envio). Me llegó el mail de BackerKit avisando que podía hacer el formulario, pero cuando entre solo me venia marcado que tenía un core y un NSFW. Pero tenía credito para meter los otros como Add-on (se supone que este es el sistema que emplea BackerKit, aunque es un poco marrullero). El caso es que cuando añadí el segundo core y el segundo NSFW, me decía la calculadora del formulario que debía 15$ en concepto de gastos de envio de estos add-ons. Osea que no solo me cobraba dos veces los gastos de envio (la primera por el primer pack, la segunda, por el segundo) sino que encima el segundo era 5$ más caro. Les envié un mail explicando, mi situación, y preguntandoles porque hay que pagar una segunda vez si se supone que ambos paquetes van en el mismo envio. Me respondieron que es porque la calculadora de BackerKit no es capaz de calcular adecuadamente los costes de los add-on, y me dieron un vale gratuito de 15$. Cuando volví a entrar a rellenar el formulario, tenía esos 15$ adicionales, y pude rellenarlo sin problema. Ok the furry box is funny but it's gonna get wrecked on a shelf... Spoke to support and explained my predicament :) Received credit towards shipping on the backerkit "survey". Completed survey and now have Kittens to go with my bears (hope they get on!) Happy days :) P.S. Suppose the box can be shaved! Fur is not to everybody's liking (^_-) Zem - I've been doing pretty good, although our cats are learning all new creative ways of being a$$holes (The one has a sweet tooth and steals my slurpee straws). Also have been researching what kind of 3D printer I might want to get. I've concluded that a "cat-proof" shield is a must. @Kevin I think you mistyped. Should be: After seeing the latest update with the AWESOME fur box, I'm glad I've KEPT my pledge. Thats got to be the BEST game box in history. To not offer a normal box as an option is FINE AS THE FURRY ONE IS EXCEPTIONALLY FUN AND DIFFERENT. Fair play to BvB FOR BEING AMAZING. @David Sánchez But how exactly did you manage it? You told them, they fixed your survey and then you finished your survey? Cómo hiciste? Viste la putada en el formulario, se lo contaste, te la arreglaron, la viste arreglada en tu formulario y procediste a cerrar el proceso con las cifras bien? Es por saber cómo hacer, estaba pensando meter a más gente en mi pledge para repartir gastos pero no sé si será viable. After seeing the latest update with the horrendous fur box, I'm glad I've cancelled my pledge and got my money back. Thats got to be the worst game box in history. To not offer a normal box as an option is crazy. Fair play to BvB though, their customer service has been good by way of email communication. @Pierre: Have you talked to <email> too? Ask them. They covered the additional $15 dollars in my shipping for free. Just explaining my case @David : Well I read it earlier before posting my comment, but I must admit I dont understand what it means : "we were not able to have shipping fluctuate depending on the other items in your cart, so that is why you are seeing the additional shipping rates". So basically BvsB says it is due to backerkit and when i wrote to backerkit they told me that it is due to the BvsV project team "sorry for the high shipping prices, although I'm afraid these were set up and double-checked by the project creators and themselves, and I'm unable to alter them in any way".. I could understand an extra fee for extra command (in addition to our pledge), containing one or many items, but can figure out why it has to add extra fee for each and every item @Pierre Arrivé: Look my previous comment, 6 below yours. @Dan Watson: As Jillian Campbell has stated some comments above yours, it seems they have to make manual adjustments to each single case, because of some BackerKit system thing. @Darwin: You're welcome :) At first I thought, the extra ship costs were a shaddy way to recoup some losses generated by unexpected amount of people from within USA ordering the packs. As said by Terms: "Free shipping in the U.S.". it's just an "error" from the BackerKit system. Anyone who's experiencing the Tax Problem, just email them in order to fix it. I don't know if they're going to make an official statement on this topic or if they are busy trying to fix it, but that is what they said to me by email. Why would it be normal to pay extra shipping fee for EACH AND EVERY addon you add to your order ?? It does not make any sense !! Can anyone answer this ? Got my postage issue sorted by contacting support directly, it was fast and easy. Looks like they need to do manual adjustments to the order to fix it, so I strongly recommend anyone who multi-pledged get in touch directly. Thanks for the heads up David and Micah. I just emailed them, but I find it weird that they haven't sent any updates regarding this issue or even the fact that they sent out surveys. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt and that they're too busy trying to fix this problem. However, part of me feels like they are going to extend this to as long as possible to potentially recoup some losses from people paying the additional shipping costs. That's such garbage, each and every backer outside North America has to contact support to sort this out? No room for error there at all.... EVERYONE: <email> USE IT! If you have an issue, that's the support email that can help you! ` And everyone that didnt get the survey link: <url>` David Roden, Haha, don't know what to tell ya, but you're not going to get your things if you don't fill out that survey link. And emailing the support email would only lead to them telling you to fill it out. Hey people READ THIS VERY IMPORTANT: I sent a mail directly to <email> explaining my case. I pledged 80$ (70$ for 2 core decks + 2 NSFW boosters, and 10$ for shipping taxes to Spain). When making the survey it said that I have to pay aditional 15$. As said, I sent an email to BvsB support regarding that addiotional tax, and they have covered the additional $15 dollars in my shipping FOR FREE. Also, they stated "As we worked with Backerkit to build our shipping prices we found we were not able to have shipping fluctuate depending on the other items in your cart, so that is why you are seeing the additional shipping rates." and "We're going to be handling the issue in a case by case example. If you like to make a comment saying that the support team was able to help you out, it might direct more people to ask us for further assistance." SO I ENCORAUGE YOU ALL TO SEND AND EMAIL TO <email> AND EXPLAIN YOUR CASE. THEY'LL HELP YOU VERY QUICK AND NICELY. P.S: Sorry for caps. Need to make important things more visible. I'm really looking forward to this game, just finished the survey and hoping for the best as a Canadian backer. Especially after TOS Card Game... Still haven't gotten that. Anyway really looking forward to June!! I've finish the survey, but I'm kind of displeased that the shipping costs for my second copy of the game are pretty much the same as the first copy (just three USD less) It would be the same for my friend to pledge her own copy instead of asking for them both together. I know you said you would figure out shipping costs for addons, but that was very different from what I thought. and people that didnt get the survey link <url>"I'm rich biotch!" Can we please get a link to the survey somewhere here on site? Sending links via emails is sooo 2006 and hell no, I’m not going to click anything in emails, especially if it doesn’t go to kickstarter.com or that bearsvsbabies domain. I have noticed that the problems with shipping only occur to backers from outside USA. Can any backer from USA confirm if it does happen to them too? Thanks I pledged USD80 for 2 full sets not knowing we would be hit with RIDICULOUS shipping charges. If this how we are treated then I would prefer to just order 1 set. But can I still change my pledge? The backerkit survey has following statement: "Credits remaining - Remaining credits go towards the project and are non-refundable." $70 for shipping 5x base + NSFW packages to Germany!? Did you hire actual bears to deliver this to my doorstep!?!? Seriously - please adjust the shipping costs, you can't be serious... $3 shipping for the base set and nsfw to Canada, add a second base set $3 shipping (ok, fair) add the nsfw set $11 shipping...I blame the condom. Like a lot of backers that pledged more money for more than one items, why am I supposed to pay 10$ shipping for the first game + addon and then an additional 15$ for the second game and addon. Why not same or even less? Jörgen Fredriksson you are friggen right. The rest of the world is paying for American shipping and its bad enough that we have to suffer exchange rates as well, especially when the converted value exceeds the actual price of the item considerably down the road when it is retail. This the last one from these guys for me. Its much cheaper to go on Amazon and buy product than to add it on from here. Shameful. I am not impressed. There are other KSs to invest in with more substance. I was asked to email <email> with any concerns. which i have done so regarding postage & the furry box I haven't yet gotten a survey. Who do I contact to fix this? So what's up with the shipping charges? I'm all in for supporting for the products, I'm buying them with two other friends so we thought we'd ship to one address and save on shipping costs, because that's how posting to one address works. One address = one charge. So please enlighten me and the rest of the backers as to why we are paying extra for shipping? No bullshit. Just received a reminder to finish my backerkit response. Won't be doing that till I hear more info on shipping charges...... Sure we have till the 5th May, should be sorted our by then. Cancel the fury box and put the money towards shipping? It can't be $8 each box to Ireland? I can't believe that if I order Exploding kittens and the other two extras that they'll post them separately. Thoughts D I was going to add on Exploding Kittens but then I discovered I can buy it cheaper on Amazon. A little surprised they don't have a better deal here. I'm really tired of these excessive shipping costs to the "rest of the world" and then it's free to ship to US. My feeling is that it's not free to ship to US - it's the rest of the world that is sponsoring free shipping to US. Am I wrong??? 1 game + 1 NSFW = $10 shipping to Denmark. Fair 5 games + 5 NSFW = $60 shipping to Denmark. + additional duties and taxes... 4 of my friends wanted the game as well so to save on the shipping I backed for them. Turnes out that was a big mistake. We'are never doing that again. I expect it to make it here via drone and in a gold box...and I'm keeping both. $3 to ship the first set to the UK, then $11 to ship the second set? Feels like I'm getting ripped off if I could have saved $8 by pledging with a second account. Not sure if this has been asked before (I have scrolled down a fair few comments and haven't seen it). Is it possible to order the game with a normal box? I don't want a "furry" box. Also have the same shipping issues as other people for adding exploding kittens. $8 for EK, +$8 for adult expansion + $8 for expansion. additional $24 for shipping? Same shipping issues here.. 35 USD + 10 USD shipping (fine so far) but if I add one extra deck + booster pack it adds 15 USD shipping cost. is this correct? Looks like I'm not the only one confused about the shipping charges. I look forward to an update ;) This user's account has been deleted. Basically same as everyone else here : Shipping costs to Belgium : 10$ for 1 core and 1 booster. Adding the 2nd core and booster I already paid for in my pledge : +15$. I guess I'm going to wait a bit before submitting. Wow the shipping costs to the Netherlands are outrageous. A proper explanation would be in place, this cannot be right. Wow, count me as another questioning the shipping charge! The survey means I'm going to be slugged another $18 for shipping when the original (plus all extras) was $7! Is this an oversight? If not how can I arrange to cancel the additional $35 pledge for another copy? It's just not worth it Seriously? USD25 shipping to Belgium for 2x Core and 2x Booster. And I imagine this does not include additional duties and taxes... Is this package being delivered by the Queen of England herself or Oatmeal the Bear on a tricycle? I'll be waiting for an explanation before filling in this survey... Are you serious about $250 shipping cost to Russia my $35 order? O_o What's going on with the surveys? I havent received any info Wow, I was going to post about the additional shipping cost for the extra pledge, but it seems like everyone has been mislead. I'd like some explanation to this. I was going to ask for a refund for that portion, but I'm concerned as there seems to be quite a few people asking the same thing. I can't imagine that the creator factored in this reaction for the amount of people that ordered multiple copies in their final pledge. I mean they spent some of the profits making Condoms and furry boxes. I am unwilling to spend $14 extra to get another box I was planning to gift for Christmas that would have costed me nothing if I waited a few months for it to show up on Amazon. I advise everyone to wait on their reply before submitting your surveys. they did say wed be getting the next update april 3rd right? I pledged $120 for 3 core decks + 3 NSFW booster... Plus shipping.. Do i add the remaining 2 sets manually in backerkit? I tried and HUALA! $38 shipping!?!? I also pledged $73 so I could get 2 sets of the game and filling out the "survey" with the second set added on I would still own I think it was about $14 for shipping to Canada, why is this ? so i looked into a bit more to see what i would pay if i got the stuff i wanted so i pledged $60 and went for the core deck which is $25+$3 shipping so $28 which leads me with $32 to get addons. And i live in Canada. Some of these shipping prices like the NSFW seems unreasonable. $10 to buy and $11 for shipping. The imploding kittens is $12.99 and $11 to ship so if i get both of those its $22.99 for add-ons and $22.00 for my shipping just for the addons. which is 44.99 just for my addon comes to a total of $72.99 for everything so i still owe 12.99 if i do that.. So $7 to send the first core deck and booster but $18 to send the second one? WTF! Seems like gouging to me of the highest order. I got that backerkit message, but since the deadline marked is May 5th, I think I will hold off and see if there is a offical message that pops up through kickstarter, I get enough skanky emails as is, I dont want to click on any questionable links Still haven't gotten survey sent to me..... Im using chrome on a windows 7 machine and mine went through...im also in the US... @Doctor Popular, did you add anything on? I got to the page where they asked if I wanted add ons and I went to the bottom of the page and saw I owed nothing so I clicked continue...at first I thought I had to select my backer rewards but than realized those would be seen as additional orders so I just clicked continue with out anything selected and it went through...Im sorry if this doesnt help, just a thought that maybe thats the problem and if you cleared the add ons it would go through. Should I be worried by that? I still haven't even gotten my survey link I really dislike when Kickstarter projects use 3rd party systems for surveys. I'm currently stuck trying to just get the rewards I signed up for, but it wants me to pay an addition $35. This would have been so much simpler if you used Kickstarter's existing survey system. Guess they are trying to make up for the 5 million they didnt make compared to the last one. =\ I'm getting the application error too. I cam here to check if anyone else has it. So if many of us are unable to reach the survey site, I'm hoping they see our comments and somehow fix the link situation. I am also getting an application error. just got the survey email, but when I click on the link I keep getting application error page....how can i fill it in by the deadline? I get the following error when clicking on the (it's not a survey) survey link: Application error An error occurred in the application and your page could not be served. If you are the application owner, check your logs for details. Looked to buy Exploding kittens and expansion sets but an extra $24 for shipping to Ireland ($8 each) is a little steep! Possibly $10 for the three sets as might be shipped separately from Bv'sB. Its cheaper for me to buy on Amazon, only by €3 but still. I'm gonna jump on the band wagon and also say I'm pledged for 2 NSFW complete decks, went to add on the second one and it's asking for $18 in shipping to Australia... :S and to add to my previous comment. I am from canada too. Tried to add the IMPLODING KITTENS addon for an extra $13 until the pledgemanager decided to add an extra $9 in shipping. Seriously WTF. This user's account has been deleted. 19.99 for exploding kittens(both of them separate) and an extra $11.00 for shipping... 12.99 for imploding kittens then an extra $11 shipping.. NSFW $10 then an extra $11 shipping.. the core deck has a reasonable shipping cost of $3 but the other ones seem a bit high.. maybe if you could comment on this that would be much appreciated. i am going to hold off confirming my information till this gets addressed. Please clarify the shipping costs many of us here have commented on. For Canada, shipping 1st deck+nsfw = 35+3 shipping 2nd deck+nsfw = 35+14 (3+11) ...?? I'm fortunate enough to be able to get mine in the US if you push, but an explanation would be appreciated. I haven't received an email yet for any survey.....are we all getting them today,and I should just wait for it.....or should I be worried I haven't gotten mine yet? I'm going to be a smart ass and point something out. Elan recently posted: "We're actually trying our hardest to avoid using the word "survey" as it's really ambiguous and confusing. (none of us are even sure where it came from or why it caught on.)" Yet emails I received to fill out address confirmation repeatedly refer to it as a survey. ;) Just received the confirmation email. No issue with shipping only have 1 pledge. It is april mop guys. APRIL MOP!!! Didn't get mine yet. Saw on backerkit that my email adres is allready known to them and that it is still waiting to be sent. Is everyone getting their email for the pledge manager? I have not gotten one yet As many people below, same problems with the calculator. I pleged 80$ for 2 core decks and 2 NSFW expansion, shipping to spain, supposedly in a single shipment, so aditional shipping fees would not be applied :/ @Jillian I noticed that too, looks like it's $7 shipping for the Core+Expansion but $7 to add an additional Core game and $10 to add an additional expansion. I realize it did say "We'll figure out any extra shipping charges when we send you the survey after the campaign." but I'm confused as to how the expansion costs MORE to ship than the main game. I think I'm going to hold off on confirming details until they've had a chance to look over this. I've been too keen in the past and have committed to additional costs only to have the organizers correct their error a little later but too late for me. Extra shipping costs that are higher than the original shipping costs huh? I guess I should've pledged twice instead of adding an extra copy. You could at least take me out for dinner before you screw me. Received the link to PM some minutes ago. Didn't spend more money on EK or an other basegame because of the high shipping costs. Also surprised to have an additional 11$ to ship my additional deck. I thought the pledge was clear and that by adding 35$, you would get everything in one shipment. Really strange... @andy...it was In the last status update that they would be emailed out april 3rd and I'm not sure how "random" it is when its an email from the creators... Be nice to get an official update notice here saying "expect an email from backerkit". It's bad security practice to follow a link from a random email and start entering personal info. No Info about pledge manager here. I'm very confused. If it costs $7 to send one $35 pledge to Australia why does it cost an extra $18 to send a second set??? Surely there's something wrong with the calculator? More than double the original shipping cost added just to add imploding kittens?? That's terrible! And then it's compounding for each additional add-on. That's not even worth it. Hi guys, Not sure if the calculators are configured correctly. Getting the additional game and booster cost more in shipping than originally calculated. Pledged $73 for two games and shipping to UK. Needed to hand over $11 additional for shipping today. Can you comment? cheers -b Hi, I've been thinking about add 2 or 3 copies for friends and split shipping costs, BUT: Shipping cost = number of copies * 1 copy shipping cost. I mean, 7$ for shipping 1 copy (Spain)... ...70$ for shipping 10 copies (10 is just an example). Really? I think it's a bit unfair to add another $8 shipping if you want to buy the Imploding Kittens add-on in Backer Kit. I'm already paying $10 shipping to Sweden for the B vs B game and I assume that you will add Imploding Kittens to that shipment if I order it. I haven't gotten a confirmation / pledge manager email either. Will the confirmation emails be sent all at once? I did not get an email yet. I locked in my Order Confirmation & Address.. Do you have a estimate as to when shipping will commence ? I cannot wait to get this game and start playing. Stupid question: I backed the core game (25+7 for me) in the survey when I add NSFW deck the shipping is added so it's ((25+10)+(7+9)) so 19$ more for 30 cards is a little steep. Is this intentional? Or the 9$ should override the 7$? Hi, I just got an email with the pledge manager, I have pledged 80 dollars (because I wanted to order a second copy and cover the shipping to Belgium) but if I want to add a second copy, I now need to pay 15 dollar extra for the shipping of the second copy? Even if the shipping for one was only 10 dollar, now it is 25 dollar for two copies, that is a bit crazy I think? Box and playmat* I got to play a round at WonderCon today. I think we are all in for a treat. The box and came out nicely too! Cheers guys, total missed the info in the update, doh :) Rereading last update 107 cards in main deck and 30 in NSFW deck. But campaign mentions 112 in main deck. Plus a mysterious kickstarter card Do we have a running total yet? Cheers D David, M&Ms? I don't know, M&M-sized cards would be pretty small... ;) ` Things are going at least pretty well for me, how are you other than employed and not bored? @David The latest update says that the cards are 2.5"x3.5" which would make them standard poker card size, which are 63.5x88.9mm. Hope this is accurate, and helps :) Hi do we know the size of the cards in mm please? I'm looking to order sleeves. I've read back to Jan but can't see any info. Cheers D Also, @Zem, how goes the schooling since the campaign ended? So stoked for getting this and the awesome-and-soon-to-come not-actually-survey... thing!!!! Also, I think a plaid lumberjack shirt might have to be a required uniform for playing this game. (A wild Bored House Hubby appears!) Jeeves, right? It won't stop until after they've all shipped! ` I only use "survey" because it's the common term, I've never really known why it's the one used either, since it's just confirming your information and asking if you want add-ons! you will be able to pick items in the pledge manager or add to your pledge so you can get whatever you want. so if I backed $60 with the core deck. Do I get two decks? I'm so excited! Suspenders! And a furry box? Who could ask for anything more? Good to hear. I may pick up a few extras as well. Is there going to be a way to purchase a second or 3rd deck at the kickstarter price on the survey? I have tax refunds burning a hole in my pocket and this is the only thing i want to buy yay Micah! the new update answers the oh so common survey question. Unfortunately I still forsee you having to tell people in the comments info on when survey's are going out. No survey was sent out yet, everyone. They'll send it out as late as possible before shipping to eliminate that exact problem of thousands of people needing to change their address, so I think they'll probably be sent out in early summer or something. I forget when the shipping date was, but think like a month before that in all likelihood. I also need to change my address, I looked through my emails though and don't believe a survey was sent out. Same here - was trying to find a survey but don't think it was sent out yet? I also will need to change my address. Can't wait for this game! We didn't get sent the shipping address survey did we? If we did I need to change my shipping address How about an Update? I´m so excited A new game similar to this has arrived on Kickstarter. It consists of building robot type creatures. Thought my fellow pledgers with similar interests would like to check it out. It's called XYbrid. If the babies, once provoked, attack everybody... Who gets to eat the babies¿ Say the is a 4 card monster, a 3 card monster and 2 babies. What if a) The 3 card monster player provokes. B) the 4 card monster provokes? C) there are 3 babies, the 4 card monster provokes D) there are two 4 card monsters? This keeps me sleepless >.< Micah, you've earned it. Dylan, they're exploring the possibility of playmats, probably as a later addon when you confirm your order. ` Mister Jeeves... you have no clue! I'm used to it now, it's a reflex since the literal thousands of people asking about them in the Exploding Kittens comments. I just wish people read the comments to see if their question was answered previously by someone here. ` Melissa, psst, don't tell anyone, but I got one too and I'm only 20! ` Jacqui, even tea is risky with campaigns as large as this one! Man, I imagine you're running to the bathroom fairly often playing that game! "Someone explains backer surveys in the comments" is one of the reasons I'm very glad I don't play the Kickstarter drinking game with anything stronger than tea. I have never been so grateful to be 35+ in my life! I can't wait to get the NSFW pack! @Mister Jeeves: You would be a millionaire. If you are including the times from the Exploding Kittens campaign, billionaire. If you include all other members of the Kitten Corp in that, probably trillionaire. What are these playmats you speak of!!! I don't see them as an option if i had a dime for every time Micah explained backer surveys Jordan, no, they'll send those out closer to shipping so they don't get tens of thousands of people yelling "Psyche!" and changing their addresses on them, flooding the support emails. I can't remember for the life of me, have they sent out backer surveys? Yea everyone should check out their fb to see what's going on. Seems like all the juicy info we're craving is just being posted their rather than here. Bears vs Babies: We're posting a Kickstarter update very soon. March 11 at 3:41pm. this was from the facebook page. (<url>"backed projects" page just now. I figured given the experience of Exploding Kittens this one would be a walk in the park and ship like a month after the campaign ended. Creator, don't forget there are some backers waiting... Are you guys gonna bring an early copy to pax east to show off?? I REALLY HOPE YOU AREN'T USING THE SAME SHIPPING COMPANY AS ORGANATTACK!!! Manan, first off, her, and second, just go to the website to check up on Oatmeal. <url>` ` However, I agree, an update on the project would be nice. Though considering the last one was Feb. 9, I'd say our best bet for a time of update would be tomorrow, March 9, one month later. At least we can hope. Goddamit we need an update. How is Oatmeal the bear! We need more pictures of him ASAP And waiting.... update??? That would be cool we ever gonna get another update? or how about Pledge Manager? @creator We see tou support a lot of projects, but what about yours? Well, Dan, I don't imagine there's alot to say. I'm pretty sure they're using all the same manufacturers as they did with Exploding Kittens, so unless they want to say they're still perfecting the mechanics and about to start manufacturing, which they've had planned out likely since before they even started this campaign, it seems a bit pointless to make an announcement. Though I agree, they could definitely have more regular updates to make the backers feel more a part of the process. I have to say, this project has very little communication regarding the manufacturing and where it's at. The smaller projects seem to have much better mannerisms in this regard... Trust me, Tom, I was one of the people here for all of Exploding Kittens. Sending them right now would cause hell. You don't want to have to deal with literally thousands of people needing to change their address constantly, and none of them knowing what a support email address is. Just be patient, they don't ship for some time, and so there's no need to send out surveys until much closer to the time when they do. Surveys would be best now. Bryson, they haven't sent out the surveys for that specific reason. They're sending them much closer to the ship date to eliminate the hassle of thousands of people needing to change their addresses. Hey Elan, I'm moving from my house in march is there a way to change my address in time? What if we have a bear with a beard made of a bear with a beard. @Jesse Lopez Thx :) @Marcel - once things are further along, they will send out an email, asking for a shipping address. People tend to move a lot, and to prevent constant update to a shipping address, they wait to send out the survey asking for your address it was my first baker donation at kickstarter. i have a little question about that. how...or when i have to send my shipping adress? i dont know how i can get the game ...if the team want to send the paket in June/July without my adress ^^ Thanks for the updates. I got your last game I kickstarted, exploding kittens very quickly. Same with the collar (kitty convict) that you sent me a while back. I know I can trust your guys' kickstarters in the future. :) Just a note: I got a response today from the team. They saw that, and the counterfeits are terrible. They're working against them, of course, I just hoped they had seen that one, which would definitely have tricked some people who didn't look closely or couldn't wait, I'm sure. It even said at least one person had bought from that specific one, though I don't know if the 100 count order was from the scammers themselves to boost their rating on the site. @Christian Good find, it'd look pretty legit to me if I didn't know that it was covered in fur lol Christian, I don't know if they have seen that, so thanks for catching it! Just a heads up to the creators someone on dhgate is selling a counterfeit copy already. <url>#gbpd-2-null Jimmy, you haven't submitted your address to begin with. Surveys haven't been sent out yet, and won't be until closer to the ship date to prevent literal tens of thousands of people needing to change address like with Exploding Kittens. This way, you're not likely to move within the couple of weeks between the surveys and shipping. Hey, I just moved recently, how do I submit an address update? are we there yet? Thanks for the update Micah I failed Hey, Evert, you had a chance to host one, you could have been the hero of your people! I'm here just to say that the entire Belgian bear population is very unhappy with the alternative fact that there's no play test party in Belgium. We would like to not get our money back and just a bunch of love. Wait, one in Omaha this time? Heck yeah, I can actually make it to one! Edward, most likely when the surveys are sent out, again for everyone else, CLOSER TO THE SHIP DATE, you should have the opportunity to increase your backing level or at least get other items added, though you'll have to pay the difference then. Leigh, you had full opportunity to host one! (didn't you? There wasn't anything excluding Australia, was there? I don't remember any at least) Kira and Stephen, and all else just as a good note: SURVEYS HAVE NOT BEEN SENT YET. Sorry, caps just to make it more noticeable. There's nothing to update, like address, because they haven't sent them yet. In fact, that's specifically why they will send them closer to the ship-date; so they don't have to deal with literally tens of thousands of people changing address on them as with Exploding Kittens. It was not fun. Trust me. Why does New Zealand get a play test and Australia gets left behind :( @stephen back. Pretty sure I never saw a survey Did I miss the option for $1 backers to upgrade? Needs more Canadian playtest parties! Nothing in Calgary, or even Alberta?? Come on now! So I forgot if I did a survey or not... I'm going to be moving within the month. Is there a way for me to update my address? How is Oatmeal doing? � @Morgan Delivery estimate on the main page is June so I don't expect surveys will be sent out for a wee while yet. yeah,an update would be nice.... A possible update? Been a month, alot must have happened in that time FIRST ever Munchkin KS! <url>#NotMySuperBowlChampions. Geist, that's news to me! Hmm, I hadn't even considered asking KS directly, but they may find some way to let you join us, Aether! Good idea, though I don't know how you present the idea to them as one they should care about in the slightest. Give this promising card game a chance. Great artwork! <url>` Sorry, cat got my tongue. As in my keyboard, my virtual tongue. And is currently hacking the internet. Please send help. Arghhh, a gassy baby got hold of my keyboard... *burp* Hiss mroww roar growl. Wrong thread... um. Growl. Meow. I'm a bored bear that wishes he were hibernating. Does that count, Aether? are we there yet? I just woke up from hibernation to bother other bears who can´t bear bored bears that are not hibernating. Very good point, hibernating sounds like a good plan to me It's winter in some places. All bears are hibernating. So be quiet please. It got a little quiet ;) Roar... Hey, Creeper, which is better, all the people coming in guns blazing shouting that they're scared to death about needing to change their address who then have to email the very flooded support or the people coming in asking about where they inform about their address or where to change it and can be told simply that the surveys haven't been sent out yet? ... Yeah, I guess I answered my own question there as I said it. That started as an actual question, then I thought about it a little. I'm so glad they decided to wait for the surveys this time! HI Rory- They'll be sending out a survey closer to the ship date where you can put your new address in. The BvB is very thorough in making sure they have the most up-to-date address from you! I don't get mine until July! How do I change/view my shipping address? I have recently moved house and need to check I have put in the new address. Thanks! I can BEARly contain my excitement to play this game. The word for today is: Doomsday We should all take a page from exploding kittens.....and smoke crack with a baby owl and before you know it it'll be June:) Yes, you are! Am right in assuming there has been no pledge manager yet? WHERES THE BEARS? @Micah: The label on the bos says: Promo Bear Box from Elan Lee" @Grimzilla @The Savage Llama @Micah I received a big wood box with a Bear inside. So ... now .... I am thinking where to put the Bear inside, now it is just sleeping but I have to think about it befor Spring. Max A bear in a box, if you know what i mean ;) Yeah... that sounds sketchy. You didn't get that from the BvB team, I bet. What promo box? Did it contain a promotional bear? Did you get an actual promotion at your job and your boss delivered the notification via Beargram? @Massimiliano Merzi- Promo bear box? Just received my promo Bear box Thx My knickers are all twisted I can't wait until June! @Neil: When they send out the survey, you will be able to tell them where you would like your rewards shipped to. It may be a few more weeks, as they likely want to ensure they have everything pretty much ready to go before doing that. NEW TO KICKSTARTER. HOW DO YOU GET MY ADDRESS FOR DELIVERY I can't Bear the waiting any longer... Kyle, I swear, I will TURN this campaign around RIGHT NOW!!! are we there yet? Just wanted to pop in and say that I'm NOT wondering when the survey is coming out. :) I can't imagine the work involved with a project as successful as BvB, but I want to thank the creators for working tirelessly to finish this project on time! Cheers! I think she's part of the bear prejudice movement....clearly upset over the kind treatment of oatmeal I'd say... The game isn't due until JUNE. It's only January, why are so many people's knickers in a twist?! It's the equivalent of "are we there yet?" which is damn annoying for the rest of us who are enjoying the scenery. Sit down, take a deep breath & have a chill pill. Cody & Oatmeal enjoy their first Christmas! <url>` Merry Christmas everyone! Happy Christmas everyone xx @Tzukasa I guess the spirit of Christmas granted your wish :P Merry Christmas @everyone! We just did a year end wrap up episode of my podcast. Talked a bit about Bears vs Babies, Exploding Kittens and Imploding kittens as well as a ton of other games. Check it out if you're interested. <url>"I've moved since the survey! HELP!" messages that plague every kickstarter that sends them too early. Wouldn't it be a water elemental with wave powers? have we heard anything from the creators about a survey etc yet? so how about mario run.. get like 3 levels for free then have to 13.99(CAN) like wow Uhhhh... I'm like a multiclassed 1st level commoner, 1st level expert. I REALLY don't see this going well. The Wave elemental has appeared. Challenge Rating: 12 HP: 333 Special Traits: Air resistance (*surfs the wave, wipes out*) Hehe, I like the sound of a wave switchboard! *spins around and around waving at anyone and anything* Teamwork! *climbs on Zem's shoulders to block visibility for the wave* Oh great, I thought I intercepted the wave, but now I'm apparently the wave switchboard! *waves at Geist through Zem* Okay, time to comment here so they keep rolling somehow! These comments may not be rolling by super fast, but they're sure outpacing most glaciers! Most of them. ;) Travis, nope, but probably soon-ish, within a week or two now. I'm not sure though. ` ` Hi, Geist. *waves back, intercepting your wave* *waves at Ginger Cub* Anyone know when the survey is being sent out? Damn autocorrect... that would be spammer, not spanner Looks like I'm being the spanner today... The biggest issue for me is it's easier for me to talk in my morning, which is when most of you are asleep. As I work for an American company, most of the big bosses get in when it's the afternoon here, so I have to concentrate on work a lot more. But Zem, we all like the spamming ;) Aether, you can be talking! Seriously, you can. I typically only talk on here in response to other people talking so it's not just me spamming, so you guys need to comment more! It's so quiet in here, and it's sad! We need to strike up a conversation, the band, matches, batters, oppressive regimes... anything that can be struck up, down, or in any direction. Oh no, we can't be getting overrun with babies! Day 2: I think there's no one left inside the Crawfish McThundersquish. Maybe a Great-White baby ate the rest of the cubs? Trueflight, that's so true! That expansion made an amazing game even more amazinger! @Kyle Zimmerman Kickstarter makes them wait at least 2 weeks for the payments to clear before they can even think about sending out a survey. They will get around to it when they are ready. In the meantime, someone got me the Imploding Kittens expansion for the last game and it really does add a lot to that game. There are more ways to mess with other players and screw with the deck now so that it adds a bit more strategy and a little less random luck to the game. Much better if you haven't tried it. Hahaha, love it!! Haha, I didn't even think about that, Aether! I like the irony there... "There's a bright side on having a literally not-bright day' hahah That's it, GC! <url>~gback/awfgrmlg.html @GC has your boss already installed some window shades? I still check regularly Zem :) Hi, Ginger! But I'm not saying at the moment, I'm saying nobody's even checked in for days! It's unnerving being in a warehouse that used to be filled with clamor that's now completely empty! I'm still here Zem, just a bit busy at work at the moment! They will send out the survey when there are ready to send it out. You need patience for kickstarter. This is not a shop. Anyone have any guesses as to when they might send out the emails for our info? Dang, it's gotten so quiet in here since the end! I was hoping this campaign would keep on rolling in the comments like Exploding Kittens, but it just died off like most other campaigns, which is super sad! Anyone still check here at least semi-regularly? Just because it's a game means it's related? It has no bearing. It's just polite to not advertise other campaigns, especially your own, unless it's one you and a few others here know and love. The dude plugged his game on another games comment section, not what I would consider in-related but whatever it's your sandbox I guess, maybe you could look into a ban from KS or an FBI investigation lol Tom, there's really nothing to update so far. They're still working on most of the stuff, so until they really have everything worked out, there's nothing to update on. The rules aren't even fully worked out last we heard, so we won't be playtesting for awhile. For instance, for Exploding Kittens, which was more developed by the same stages than BvB, playtesting happened about 2 months after the campaign. Dan, just below "Post Comment" is "Be respectful and considerate." The first point is "Don’t spam. This... promoting a project where it shouldn’t be promoted" Most people take that to include advertising other unrelated projects of no interest in comment sections. (not to mention dead sections like this one). "The comment and messaging systems on Kickstarter are here so people can communicate, ask questions, and cheer one another along — not for spam." Why are they so quiet on updates. I'm wondering what the box looks like And when we get the demo packs I have found a couple games that way I never would have otherwise found, seeing as this whole forum is to get projects noticed, I wouldn't think that it would be much of an issue for you guys? Ah heck, one to close out the week, but wherever everyone went, we need to get them back to keep commenting on here! I miss all you guys! ` I am not messing up the covers.

I missed that one. I thought you were talking about Puppy Zombies. <url>"Cheetah Cub" Most games are derivative of other games. While the mechanics of Millennials is pretty much the same as Exploding Kittens, the premise is different enough that I feel it may appeal to a different audience. Personally, I don't subscribe to the type of slacker mentality to be a fan of Millennials (the game) so I'll stick with EK and BvB. I do play other games though. When you think about game design, how many games are derivative of Settlers of Catan, or Cards Against Humanity? Spin-offs will occur, but usually aren't as successful as the original game. On rare occasions though, a spin-off could end up being better than the original. An example of this escapes me right now, probably because it is so rare. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, Exploding Puppies never funded. It was cancelled. Lets get those comments flowing today! ;) And what the? I refreshed the page, but those two comments didn't show up until I commented! Man, today I could use the sleep song. Though I can't comment it because it's only like 5 comments down! Come on, where is everyone all of a sudden?! Why is it suddenly so dead in here? Woo!!! I can't wait! I think that's a compliment. It speaks of something that is good, and true fans will always know which version was the original. Sure, it's not fair for the creators but as my former boss used to say: "we are creative people, ideas won't run out, we will always find something new to create" (or something like that, the translation is not exact) Pyt Viper, that's nothing new. Look up Exploding Puppies, the only one to unfortunately have actually made its goal. It's usually best to just not bring attention to it and hope it fizzles out, but EPuppies' goal was so low they didn't need many backers at all. @Creator. Look at the new KS called Millennials!! A rip off of Exploding Kittens. Identical rules! Job instead of Exploding Kitten.. Millennial card instead of Defuse! Can't people have ANY original ideas of their own?!?! Oh dear, it has gone a bit quiet in here, hasn't it? Or maybe everyone's just in a post-overconsumption coma? To cheer you up, here's a webcam of some very adorable hibernating orphan grizzlies. <url>` <url>"Cheetah Cub" People, please do not post links to ads on Amazon.

I went through so slow this time!) Oh man I wasn't around to see POOTO's fall And thanks for the clarification GM & Zem This won't be sold anywhere until most likely at least when ours ship from the Kickstarter. So anything before, say, July, and not by the same team as Exploding Kittens, most likely, is a fake and/or scammer. Yea... That's definitely not legit ^"Cheetah Cub" @Stephen Wu, you don't actually see "this product" on Amazon. What you see is an ad taken out by someone that redirects you to a different website entirely. The game described in this KickStarter is still in development and won't be ready to ship until June, 2017, after a considerable amount of playtesting. I see this product on Amazon being sold by a third party. Is that a legit product ? June, that's where we saw it! I knew they hadn't talked about it, but that we had some idea. So yeah, very likely June. ^"Cheetah Cub" The pledge tiers both say Estimated Shipping: June 2017. They delivered EK on time, so I expect to receive Bears vs Babies sometime next June. I believe shipping will be next summer, maybe July. That's what I remember them saying. Long way off for shipping. They still have to mass produce the game before that. Any update guys? When are you shipping? ^'Cheetah Cub" @Neil Wright, try one of the boxes that they sell for Magic: the Gathering. They should be the same size as Exploding Kittens. You can pick one up at just about any gaming store. You guys should totally add a portable box/case. We're always taking exploding kittens on the train with us but don't want to take the whole box so end up carrying them in a plastic bag! Repeat, POOTO is down. He was delicious. ^"Cheetah Cub" POOTO was delicious. Aether, oh yeah, I meant to just do that for like a couple hours for fun, but totally forgot! Yeah, the "I am the one who knocks" line was made famous by a reference in Breaking Bad. I thought it was funny because yesterday when signing up for your behind the scenes dealio, I thought of making my name Micah "Zem "The One who Knocks" the Mattress" Philson, but I decided against it, and it turned out to be too long for KS, so I shortened it. @Aether: I think that's from Breaking Bad, but as I haven't seen the show myself, can't be 100% sure of that. they will probably use the same pledge manager as Exploding Kittens so you can add as many copies of the game as you want and might even be able to buy EK or other stuff they offer. . when it becomes active it will probably be available here . <url>"The One who Knocks" Chris, when you get the email survey in a week or two, most likely, you'll have the option to add extra money for extra decks. I want a couple copies of this game, I don't understand how to order more than one? The email says to pay more than the $35, but WHERE and HOW do I do that?? Usually Kickstarter support answers in 2 working days. If you sent the mail before Friday, you should look into your Spam folder in case it is there. Any chance you could borrow the card of a friend/relative and repay them later? I think that would be enough to fix the problem right away ;) I have a problem with my pledge. It errored twice due to the problem with my card. It should be fixed now, but I cant fix the pledge. Its been stuck in processing for last 2 days and the money were not charged. Can someone look into this? No response from Kickstarter Support yet. Thanks. hahaha I liked 'Teddy', more for the crickets' part than for the name itself though... XD Wow, I haven't done this since last thursday! I've been so busy or mixed up all this time until Cha reminded me today! ` I am not messing up the covers.

It's a horrible burden to put on an innocent beast. Just plain "Oatmeal" seems appropriate to me and, apparently, a few others. GM, there was "Oatmealia McBearface the Destructor", which I quite liked. Kinda wish that could have gotten a few more likes! ;) So, why is it that after a contest is over, great ideas start popping into your(or is it just me?) head for other suggestions? Lady Oatmelia Von Bearington(not sure if it was suggested...but oh well) I am glad that Oatmeal won the contest over the other two childish names. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Kieran Donnelly, I'd suggest contacting your card issuer via the phone number listed on the back of your card and ask them why they are rejecting the transaction. They might be waiting on you to verify that it is a valid charge. The following was taken from the KickStarter FAQ at <url>… That's a good place to go if you have questions. A project I'm backing just succeeded and my pledge was declined. What do I do? If your pledge was declined, log in to Kickstarter and click the “Fix payment” button in the banner at the top of your screen. This will guide you through the process of changing your payment method. We'll also send you an email every 48 hours with a direct link to correct the issue. But don't delay: backers have 7 days to resolve payment issues before they're dropped from the project. We'll also automatically retry your pledge at the end of this timeframe. It may not necessarily be the case that there’s a specific issue with your card, so much as that you’ll need to ask your bank why this charge in particular is being declined. You may also want to include the details of this transaction, such as: - The charge being from Kickstarter. - The amount pledged for the project. - The date when Kickstarter attempted to collect your pledge - this was the date that the project you backed ended. If the project hasn't ended yet, you can use the date you attempted to pledge. Once you’ve contacted your bank, feel free to log in to the Kickstarter account from which you pledged and click the “Fix Payment” button in the “Action Needed” banner. Oatmeal What is the bear's name? What did we/you name the besr? Both my cards getting rejected for my pledge. Any idea where I go for support? Wish this site accepted paypal! Morning cubs :) Er... yeah, what she said! But please be patient. With SO many backers, the BVB team has to receive all the funds from Kickstarter before finalizing the survey and sending it out to us! Surveys are usually sent out 2-4 weeks after the campaign ended. If you've been receiving email notifications throughout this campaign, you'll get the survey through that same email address. Aw man, I've got 2 full days of actual work! Nah, just 1 and possibly 1/2, but I may end up skipping tuesday. Sad that, since I didn't drive myself here and just hitched a ride with my brother and hence have no way of getting back on my own until he comes by tuesday for break later in the day, I'll just be skipping to get some extra sleep, but C'est la me. does anyone know when theyll send out the pledge manager?(to confirm mailing address) @Tobias Huettenrauch Backerkit can do it, however i assume thats only if they config it to enable the option. You'll know soon enough i'm sure as Elan and the team are awesome at investor service :) @Tobias Unless they fulfil with a pledge manager sevice where you can still add money, I don't think that's an option right now. But I wasn't around when EK came out so I don't know if they will proceed with KS and surveys, or with a 3rd party service. I want buy more than 1 Pack. But how i can add more? Already pay for one. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Michael Braunstein, I wouldn't expect an app very soon as the card game itself is still in development. We already know that there will be a lot of playtesting before the game is finalized, so I doubt that they would even consider developing an app before the card game is delivered to all backers. It was well after fulfillment was complete on Exploding Kittens before the app came out, so I would expect BvB to follow a similar pattern of development. You'll probably hear it here first if they do decide to develop an app. Any word on if there are plans for an app version like Exploding Kittens? ^"Cheetah Cub" That's why I added that to the dictionary. It's just funnier if you "get" the whole parody. btw POOTO i in the bag, literally. He was starting to dry out. @CB I made pumpkin pie today too! But not from a real pumpkin. Yay POOTO Oh, it's parody of POTUS?! I was just thinking of it as a code! POOTO sounds weird, I was just saying "The pie has left the oven!" like some military term. I knew it changed to an object title midway through, but I didn't know it was supposed to be like the president! Oh cool, I was gone all day but don't have tons to catch up on! @CB I like the addition to the dictionary haha. Yes, I knew it came from your pumpkin, I was still speaking in-character ;) ^"Cheetah Cub" POOTO is now in the dictionary: <url>"Cheetah Cub" Now that POOTO is a thing, I'll have to add it to the dictionary. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Aether, POOTO came from my BvB themed pumpkin. Scroll down to read the whole story. man, where did that POOTO came from? @Rye S yes the NSFW will fit into the furry box. They are making the box big enough for at least 2 additional booster packs. Will the NSFW pack fit into the furry box? ^"Cheetah Cub" @tony, there is no NSFW deck. The NSFW package contains one standard deck and one NSFW booster pack. If you pledged for two of them, you should be getting 2 standard decks plus 2 NSFW booster packs. ^"Cheetah Cub" Lockdown ... POOTO is secured. Radio silence until Thanksgiving. I am curious. I backed the NSFW deck with an additional $35 for a second NSFW deck, but the confirmation email I just got shows 1 NSFW deck and 1 standard deck (which should have only been $25). Has anyone else had this problem or know how to get it fixed? Let's kick some baby butt! Rrrraaaaaar! Pumpkin loaded and ready to shoot. Waiting for command. Eagle is on the move. The Eagle has found its target; the Eagle has landed. How much more do I have to pay to have a Bane bear? :) congrats!!! ^"Cheetah Cub" Attention all units ... threat condition three. Secure POOTO. Be alert for nefarious activity in the vicinity of POOTO. Got it. Eagle Eye approaching to target... POOTO is unaware of my presence Congratulations to all the bears, babies and staff of the project! Whether they are exploding or imploding, I love me some kittens. Nowz I gots me some Bears and Babies to look forward to. I may need a bigger house. Yay! Good luck! Woohoo! ^"Cheetah Cub" POOTO is on the move, Reoeat: POOTO is on the move! Mike Robbins, this may have been "the easy part", but it's by NO means easy at all! That sounds like code, CB. "The Pie is out of the Oven. Repeat. The Pie has left the Oven!" ^"Cheetah Cub" The pie is out of the oven. ... A Pie! ... I made a PIE! :-) the easy part's over...don't f&ck up the rest ;) Love the Oatmeal. Really enjoyed exploding kittens and I know this game is going to be even better. All the best in your future projects and really excited to play this one! My daughter and I funded the Exploding Kittens game and now this one. We cannot wait to see the fur covered product. We share your sense of the bizarre. Thanks for being outside of the box at all times. I'M SO EXCITED TO EAT BABIES!!! This will be fun! congrats and huzzah for creativity! Way to go guys. Now. The wait. I'm so excited to see the stuff and things!! Whoo-hoo! Another NSFW game to hide away from my 8-year-old! :) Shelley, not quite sure of that. They're both creative, but as a person who's read virtually every single thing by both of them at LEAST once (every Far Side at least 4 times now), I find their comics to be very different. Maybe you guys should send out a NFR copy to Gary Larson, of the "Far Side" fame; Both Matt's and Ellen's creativity reminds me so much of Mr. Larson's work. I would take a wild guess and say that's true for both of you, even if his work was a little before your time. YAAASSSS!!! Is it June yet?? ;) FYI - my card payment was initially declined too. I'm in UK and my bank stopped the payment in case it was fraudulent - once I had confirmed with the bank that Bears vs Babies was a legitimate thing, resubmitted payment info and all done =) Now, BRING ON THE BABY EATING!!! Did mine ship yet??? =] MMmmmmm.... thanksgiving! @Leighann - Have you played Ninja Burger? It's a great game that's humorous and ninja themed. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Sally T, well I didn't buy this pumpkin until last Sunday, so it's nice and fresh. Also, I drew the picture on instead of carving it, so the skin helped keep it from drying out. My apartment already smells a bit like Thanksgiving even though I haven't added the other ingredients to make it into a pie yet. YES T-PLEASE or something that useful to keep/and or show off in public☺ I have full confidence in the team! Hope the project gets ahead of plan so I can get it earlier! @CB, you're lucky your pumpkin lasted so long. Mine got spots well before anyone got round to doing anything with it, so it's next year's compost now. Wow... It's windy out... Like, REALLY windy! Between these two buildings, it got easily above 50, possibly to 60 mph! I almost lost the bag I was holding, and I'm surprised I have any hair left! ^"Cheetah Cub" Yeah, @Cub-Cake, I check the FAQ first whenever I have a problem that's KickStarter related. Thanks for pulling that up, CB. Will be helpful to use in future responses. The following was taken from the KickStarter FAQ at <url>#Trou That's a good place to go if you have questions. A project I'm backing just succeeded and my pledge was declined. What do I do? If your pledge was declined, log in to Kickstarter and click the “Fix payment” button in the banner at the top of your screen. This will guide you through the process of changing your payment method. We'll also send you an email every 48 hours with a direct link to correct the issue. But don't delay: backers have 7 days to resolve payment issues before they're dropped from the project. We'll also automatically retry your pledge at the end of this timeframe. It may not necessarily be the case that there’s a specific issue with your card, so much as that you’ll need to ask your bank why this charge in particular is being declined. You may also want to include the details of this transaction, such as: - The charge being from Kickstarter. - The amount pledged for the project. - The date when Kickstarter attempted to collect your pledge - this was the date that the project you backed ended. If the project hasn't ended yet, you can use the date you attempted to pledge. Once you’ve contacted your bank, feel free to log in to the Kickstarter account from which you pledged and click the “Fix Payment” button in the “Action Needed” banner. My son is VERY excited for this game. He has one very important question: will there be bear ninjas? Baby ninjas? He's really into ninjas. @Mike Kabala, I recieved the email about the week grace period but the issue is I don't know hoe to fix it. I can't find any solutions below and my card's fine. I only bought a steam game a hour ago with the same card. T SHIRTS?!? Yes, pleaaaaaase!!! ;) The countdown has begun.....it worse than waiting for Christmas Super excited about this... Now to wait 7 months! Congrats! Keep up the good work. We're looking forward to enjoying the fruits of your labor. Piers brings up a good point, everyone: What's the new support email address? We'll need that to redirect people with issues. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Piers Millar, You have a week to get your payment to go through. Please read the comments below for suggestions on how to resolve the issue. Kickstarter declined my card but its got enough for it. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Barkin Bulut, they said last night during the livestream that it will probably be late fall next year before BvB will be available at retail. They made no promises whatsoever about whether it would ever make it to Amazon. You have a week to get your payent to go through. I would keep trying. You might need to call your bank saying it's for a KickStarter project and ask them to approve the payment. @Barkin - Not sure yet what the BvB team plans to do as far as retail. Can't promise anything just yet. ^"Cheetah Cub" If all goes well, in about 3 hours my BvB themed pumpkin will become BvB themed pumpkin pulp. After that, it will become BvB themed pumpkin Pie. It will be hard to wait until next Thursday to eat it though. ... Especially since there'll be no one around to slap my hand it I touch it. @Aether Tower @Melissa ''Cub-Cake'' Nicole thanks for answers its probabily because of exchange rates.Anyways,do you know if i could get the game on amazon when its all finished ? @Elizabeth and we haven't seen all of the cards yet!!! Imagine what the NSFW cards must be!! Thanks to you, I'm going to win Cool Dad of the Year with my son (who's a big fan of Exploding Kittens). Of course, I'm his only dad, so it's kind of an easy contest, but I need all the help I can get. And I guess I'll kind of have fun with it too. Great job! I miss it too @Aether! It's so confusing! I am so excited this got funded! It's going to be amazing! hahah Cub-Cake beat me... I miss the "X new comments" bar @Barkin Some cards are not accepted by kickstarter, there should be a page about it somewhere. Anyway, you can always ask for a familiar/friend to pay for you with you paying him/her money-first @Barkin - i would first make sure that your payment info is completely correct and up to date on kickstarter. If so, make sure your bank allows the payment, etc. Right now this is a kickstarter/banking issue. I'm so happy! Yippee! Beary McBearface oh help me im using master card and i am sure that i have much more than needed money in my debit card but it says "fix your payment" please help me :( Let's hope they implement that @CB, the support team from KS has always responded well ^"Cheetah Cub" I was rather fond of the pickle. I hope they scan the drawings before mailing them off, so that they can share them with more people. @Thallium - definitely! Make sure you get that from them :) Last night's live stream was awesome. I loved the little pirate slug that Matt Inman drew of my suggestion. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Tim B, my guess is that you've never had to produce 85,500 items and ship them all over the world before, right? The costs do tend to add up a bit. @Tim - make a lot of furry boxes to make people happy :P Got my confirmation email! *** 3 Million Dollars Raised ?!? *** What're you gonna do with that much money? My ghod! Loved Exploding Kittens... so happy to be be on the Bears vs Babies supporting team as well � Congratulations! Can't wait! Woo hoo!!!! This is the most-anticipated game in my household! C'mon JUNE 2017! Oooh @HC, let me know what the Harry Potter movie is like, thinking of going tomorrow :) xx I actually love babies, but have often wished I had a bear in the basement when I could send the little tykes for a "time-out." Thanks for providing an imaginary basement bear! Yipeeee! ^"Cheetah Cub" I sent a request to KickStarter support. Keeping my fingers crossed. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Aether, it should just be a simple database query, so sorting by city should be just as easy as sorting by country. You just need to eliminate the top 10 part, or display the results in a list that you can scroll through page by page, like comments. Great News. - cant wait! I know! it would be nice to have a tool to see all of the community rather than the top 10. At least on the countries, maybe cities is asking for too much, or all cities of the top country @F Enderica que padre que seas de Ecuador!! =D @CB - Yey!!! I like the sound of that. I don't have a ton of time tonight because we are going to the Harry Potter movie but I will check in around that xx ^"Cheetah Cub" @Kurt77, lol Hey all OK just got an email that the campaign was successful, but I checked my mailbox and the game isn't in there. What gives? Seriously though, can't wait to get my hands on this little fuzzy treasure. Yaaay! Can't wait :) Woohoo! Can't wait for this game to ship! Congrats Elan and all others involved! WOOT WOOT!!!! I am soooo stoked this is getting produced!!!! I can't wait to play it!!! ^"Cheetah Cub" @HC, a lot of people have moved over here to get away from the negative comments on other campaigns. Stick around, because the fun is just getting started. @CB - Please don't bring FC over here. I want to forget that comment section. Bears v Babies has been such a delightful experience. This community is wonderful. I love you all x ^"Cheetah Cub" Well, the Community page is useless! Unless your city is among the top 10, there doesn't seem to be a way to search for it to see how many backers are from there! KickStarter metrics should be searchable . Go Bears!!! GOING TO BE AWESOME! I just pooed myself from excitement! ^"Cheetah Cub" How do I find out how many backers are from Charlotte? ...I cannot wait to smuggle this game into Russia! I think I'm the only backer from Ecuador haja ^"Cheetah Cub" Except in Russia, Kyle Edgemon. Russia doesn't allow those "dangerous American card games" into the country. Congrats! hahaha Congrats :) Yay! I can finally legally eat babies. Take that, fascists! Hmm, only 891 backers on this project from New York. Would have anticipated more! Oatmeal!!!! 13, 790 new backers.... that's a huge addition indeed Mike Kabala Superbacker about 2 hours ago ^"Cheetah Cub" @Aether, Scooby was a Chihuahua. I adopted him from my neighbor. Her kids named him Scoobee Dew because they liked the cartoon. hahaha that's hilarious! Sorry about Scoobee passing out =/ Cappuccino seems like a good pal too, though! And he has also a nice name *sigh* that's unfortunate. It's one thing i hate about really popular projects. The more backers, the more room for trolls and complaints and it always seems to drown out anyone that's being positive. A lot of new backers that don't understand the purpose of kickstarter. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Cub-cake, a lot of issues brought in the trolls on Fidget Cube. The voting on the Backer-designed color scheme had a lot of issues and was partially conducted via Facebook, so some backers couldn't participate while some non-backers could. Then, the Chinese knockoffs began to appear and lots of backers kept posting the links to those sites. All of the spam drowned out the positive. oatmeal What was the winning bear name? ^"Cheetah Cub" @Glen Gregoris, stay tuned. There will be a lot of playtesting going on before next June. So far though, Matthew has steered clear of American politics, so I don't expect to see your design idea in the final deck. Sorry. I think we need a "Trump" baby card. @CB - why did Fidget cube comments turn negative? Hello Cubbies Has anyone had an update, or mail about when they gonna charge the credit cards or ehat is going on, I'm kinda worried haha Yea he worked really hard on it and we got occasional updates for a long time about progress and what was delaying him. Then it just stopped. I still hope one day I'll get a surprise package from George Purdy. @CB Those are nice! We have metal dice here as well. ^"Cheetah Cub" My favorite D20 actually came from a coin campaign: <url>"Cheetah Cub" @DtQ, that project looks awesome. Too bad it never delivered. I'm still waiting for one to happen from 2012 but that's what happens with KS <url>"Cheetah Cub" Fidget Cube was one of my faves until the comments turned negative. I've only backed a few KSers but this and EK are by far my favorites The most funded KS I've ever backed is still Exploding Kittens. B-) Yea mike same as me...The biggest kickstarter i backed before this was MDB but i got a email very quickly ^"Cheetah Cub" I still haven't received any KickStarter notifications in my email, but this isn't the only highly-funded project I've backed so I know that's normal. Don't worry about it if you're in the same boat. KickStarter eventually catches up and withdraws your funds. ^"Cheetah Cub" @PC, I believe @Aether was referring to my pet Chihuahua, Scoobee Dew, not the cartoon character Scooby Doo. I still miss Scoobee, but Cappuccino keeps me plenty busy these days. Sounds delicious That shyness delicious GC I was never a huge fan of that cartoon though would watch it if nothing else was on Cadburys chocolate bar filled with honeycomb. They are delicious! <url>"Cheetah Cub" @Aether, Scooby was a Chihuahua. I adopted him from my neighbor. Her kids named him Scoobee Dew because they liked the cartoon. Voting is very over Lady Bearington :-) Yes it is What's a Crunchie? Haha I know! I'm so glad I bought a Crunchie earlier! That's really annoying and inconvenient... Unfortunately after the campaign ends the X new comments button stops showing up GC that's terrible also what you get for eating healthy! @Steff thank you pal My apple was mouldy/bruised on the inside, quite far down. Didn't realise until after I had taken a bite. Now I'm sad that I can't eat my apple, and slightly disgusted by what I put in my mouth... Morning! The page isn't coming up saying however many new comments, I didn't realise people were here until I refreshed! @Barkın Bulut - it can take some time, especially with so many backers In a week or so you'll get a backer survey asking for any last min changes( maybe you want an extra copy or want to upgrade to include the NSFW) that will include payment in case you need to change from your original choice my card hasnt charged yet,does anyone know why? I didn't get an email but I got a notification from the app Am I the only one who didn't get a "successfully funded" email? The campaign ended and no one want to talk anymore? Morning folks @GC - I am so happy for you as well xx Pub Cub, OH, when you said "the new Tolkien book", I was like, wait, are we suddenly roleplaying 50-70 years ago or something?! ;) Morning cubs! What a night/afternoon/evening (depending on your location) that was! So happy that Elan drew my dino with a jet pack! someone please take the 50 people picture dressed as bears/babies when you have the chance :) Oatmeal GG WP guys! Lookin forward to that furry box and streaming a live session! Yeah- it may take about 48 hrs Hmm money not drawn, guess it takes a while whit this amount of backers ;-) I took a mini nap (not planned), just ate dinner (at 11pm!) and checking in to say hi! watch the whole stream but here's a peek at the bear <url>"Cheetah Cub" 6th Most Backed KickStarter campaign 3rd Most Backed KickStarter Game 32nd Most Funded KickStarter campaign ^"Cheetah Cub" Cappuccino has calmed down a bit after letting him out to play, "run, run, run!" That used to be one of Scooby's favorite games, only he didn't nip at my pants leg every time he circled by. Proof that all pets are unique. ... Anecdotal proof any way. My vote goes for Arya Stark! @zem I didn't know they kept the comments open much past the campaign end. I never joined in the comments on EK, I backed it too late. How's school going? should've had a growling box... would've hit 88k backers then... Beary McBearface! Hubby, you don't have to leave. The comments are still open, and we'll still be here talking for months/years most likely! Lady Bearington! I'm going to miss this campaign, the social media challenges, and all the nice commenters. You guys made this an amazing thing to be a part of :) now to sit by the mail box patiently for the next year Yay! @Bored House Hubby! That's awesome! @CB - i have a feeling Cappuccino and my roommate's dog ,Mavis Davis would get along quite well! I saw a haiku yesterday night on twitter with the #bearsvsbabies hashtag. It really made me laugh to see one on the last 24 hrs Bon Nuit DtQ Thanks @Quack! take care OK kids I'm going to sign off for a bit enjoy your night! So stoked that Matt and Elan answered two of my questions on the live stream :) ^"Cheetah Cub" Cappuccino is eating my hand, but he always does that. Oh man, Leo is pissed...i've been ignoring him. He's eating my foot. The Animals - House of the Rising Sun <url>"Cheetah Cub" Found it: <url>"Cheetah Cub" Does anyone have the URL for the bear video? Was the name finally revealed? I couldn't stream the session. Bears! Babies! General insanity! Fun! Aaw, now it doesn't show "newer comments" because it's funded! very adequate song @cha, as always ^"Cheetah Cub" It's going to be fun playtesting between now and next June. Kool & The Gang - Celebration <url># HA, yeah, literally close for one second, and that second was a month ago! Thank you guys for this amazing campaign!!! @house arrest- hehehehehe Hmm.. .must wait for final tallies! jhahhahahahahahahah ZEM!!! hahahahahah you are awesome man Me too, it looked good there for a bit. Rats. Will 85,581 be the final count? I so hoped they'd break into 2nd! @hc Hi! I missed you throwing chocolates around. FINALLY! I can finally go pee! I've had to for well over an hour now! I couldn't miss anything, though! Phew, it was close there for a second, glad to see this one funded Yey!! Couldn't sleep. Had to thank Elan and Matt for a wonderful campaign. Seriously so much fun guys :]]] Ok. Now bed zzz Congrats on a super successful campaign, you guys are awesome. Thanks you Oh good you can replay it... at least my friend will know I tried to get her a penguin up to no good. :P @zem - lolol Thanks for another fantastic campaign, and the many friends I have made on EK and BvB. You've made a wonderful amazing community of backers! Creeper, funded? A little late! ^"Cheetah Cub" Congratulations all around on another successful campaign! Funded!!!

Uh oh @Aether eying @Zem yep you better be careful what you're asking for ;) In bed ready to watch this on my phone. Wish my screen would go darker, it's so bright! A friend of the family was just for a short visit to Mexico City and loved it. Especially that super duper museum (forgot the name) looks like a shiny ship I figured you'd appreciate that Cha! Aether, be careful what you ask for... ;) @Aether...you gonna make it!! @DTQ..*big smile* ^"Cheetah Cub" Riding the autobus in Mexico City? You are brave, @Aether! Oh man... I'm in the bus! So close to home and just 15 min for the livestream... if I don't make it on time, someone please pretend to be me :P Oatmeal just posted on Facebook about the livestream. I asked him to draw my autistic daughter (left her photo in a comment there since we can't post photos here). We play EK as family game night weekly and can't wait to get this game. I am hoping she gets honoured with a drawing :] For a second I thought that you were going to say 'catch pokemons in Germany' @Cha hahaha 80's Hair Metal FTW! YAS! DTQ! I was trying to hold off on this but I'm too excited Europe - The Final Countdown <url>"Cheetah Cub" @DtQ, suit yourself. I'm still watching the livestream on my TV. (a Sony) Is she making any good food while doing that? :) ^"Cheetah Cub" @!C, oh, is THAT what they're doing? I thought they were coming up with wacky ideas for the "mystery head!" Are we there yet? My cat keeps sneaking into our pots and pans cupboard and napping in our frying pan... sneaky kitty I'm totally going to (not) miss Thanksgiving next week. On the very plus side I may catch some German holiday markets :) I"m open to anything but Apple Guys try to suggest your drawing ideas during the live stream in the comment section there :) ^"Cheetah Cub" @DtQ, I have Apple, Android, Windows, and Amazon devices. Why limit yourself with fanboy loyalty? A black kitten with green eyes fighting a Thanksgiving turkey @Aether...*smiles* done with the naming songs.

Is good to see this section so alive again! @Cha I think it's epic that you are posting music on the last hours! That was the first thing that caught my attention into the comments section, your playlists :) This user's account has been deleted. Huh. Prof F only backed one project. EK. It'll just be fuzzy furry :) So long as the box doesn't have annoying cry when you open it :p Explaitten... @Cha! Yes he did! ^"Cheetah Cub" @HC, good to see you out of hibernation! ^"Cheetah Cub" ExPrez was here early on and then disappeared again. ^"Cheetah Cub" I.ve seen GCoD on other gaming projects, but not here.

(Hotel California heard playing in the ditance) ....wait... jelly babies are a real thing? *goes to google* ^"Cheetah Cub" I used to carry around a bag of gummy bears, thinking they were the same thing. WRONG! Jelly Babies are worth trying. Hey, PoT! CB, hey, you're not wasting the pumpkin then! ` I see how it is. I leave, so you guys start the party here without me! 23 comments? That's the most we've had in this short a time in... over 3 hours! ;) @CB, you were definitely thinking ahead ^"Cheetah Cub" @BHH, they arrived here a few days ago. I ordered them through Amazon. ^"Cheetah Cub" I'm seriously considering making my themed pumpkin into a pie for Thanksgiving. @CB, now I need to wear my 4th doctor scarf if Jelly Babies are on the menu ^"Cheetah Cub" @Wong Kok Chuen, check out Amazon.com. They can hook you up with Exploding/Imploding Kittens. ^"Cheetah Cub" Ooh, definitely need to break out the jelly babies! @Creator: during survey, can I add my order for Exploding Kittens, Exploding Kittens NSFW and Imploding Kittens? @Amanda A, also liking your thinking as well I saw a butterbeer recipe the other day, 2 measures vodka, 1 measure butter ripple schnapps, cream soda to personal taste and an overlarge ice cube, so I might try that... I do like @Cub-cake's idea though. But that's just me. well, i'm personally having vodka and reese's pieces... Mead! Gummy bears and jelly babies! Milk and (teething) biscuits! @Everyone - Any thoughts/suggestions for BvB themed celebration snacks? I vote for Lady Bearington, althought Oatmeal is a close second. I shan't be a baby about it The anticipation is mounting, i can bear it. @Hibernating Cub - It's a mystery! When tallies came to a close, they wanted it to be a surprise! Final hours - how sad but exciting at the same time! What's the current tally on the bear naming contest? @PoT! Hello dear friend! Hope you are well!! @CB - If only i had known then to order a bear onesie.... only have one that looks like my cat. That was a coincidence. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Cub-Cake, if you have a bear onesie, you should wear that. I shared out but I think the only folks in my networks who'd be interested have already backed. :) We've been trying to twist our coworker's arm for a $1 contrib but no luck so far. PS LOL at the "shaved-in logo" idea. I think somebody should push for that. Hi Cub-Cake Long time. Well, caught up on youtube, nothing else to do, I think I'll tune out until the countdown stream and play games or something. I'll try to check in a little bit. I just hope that it doesn't shed too much, as I want to be able to enjoy its furry goodness for many years! LADY BEARINGTONNNNNNNN! Yeah, I think they had just confirmed it was possible at that point and are still finalizing designs. ^"Cheetah Cub" @BHH, I think they are still working out the design of the furry box. They didn't actually have one made up yet when they first announced it. Second most backed GAME. We're not going to come anywhere close to Fidget Cube. Just realized....I'll be on the train during the live stream. Won't be able to watch it... On my computer! Should i put on my cat onesie and have a martini? 3.5 k more backers to make BvB the 2nd most backed project! (just after EK) Let's share!! =D Also wondering if a cthullu-ducken is a tasty Thanksgiving treat. I'm wondering if the fur box will have a logo printed in coloured fur or will the logo be shaved? Oatmeal! ` ` Haha, just kidding. Dr. P, great so far! Only 2 classes, done at 10:30 am, and then all this! Not to mention the best part: I can miss tomorrow, take a 3 day weekend, have 2 days of stuff next week, and then a 5 day weekend for thanksgiving! 8/10 of the coming days are break for me! @Rebecca - sadly, voting has closed Lady Bearington! I don't think I'm leaving this in the right place, but you'll get the idea. @zem and CB, donut hangovers are the worst Oh good, auto-translation is useful. :) @Sally - I filled in the "per" without realizing you missed it How was your day Zem? ^"Cheetah Cub" Yeah, why is it they put the most used keys right under the weakest finger? I meant 4-5 *per* minute. Must... stop... watching... @Amanda you're probably hallucinating votes by now whether anyone posts them or not! The new backer rate has been at about 4-5 minute the last couple of hours, not sure they're going to make another 3700 before closing. ^"Cheetah Cub" Yeah, @Zem, but it will be hard to avoid Beary McBearface without going totally off-grid. I know right? Honestly, my pinky finger is the most worn out "return" "shift" "return" "shift"... poor right pinky :P It's gonna be hard to tune those comments out, Amanda! You're going to be seeing "Oatmeal!" for days! I'd suggest avoiding the cereal aisles of stores for a few weeks. lol. Voting is closed, and I have stopped counting Aaaaand people are still voting. 2 hours later. Oatmeal Oatmeal CB, they got me at "A new ga-..." And at that point I blacked out, and when I woke up, it was 5 minutes and $35 later. And cheering! How could I leave out cheering! I'm still on board for Lady Bearington myself... ^"Cheetah Cub" They got me at Elan Lee and Matthew Inman. Harambear FTW The general comments will now be interspersed with conversation, commentary, and the occasional vote. Came here to vote, backed the game. Oatmeal got me at NSFW. Oatmeal ^"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, that could be a hangover from eating too many donuts. ;-) lol Wow, the comments stopped so hard after the votes stopped that I got whiplash! Here's hoping for Lady Bearington! ^"Cheetah Cub" Can't wait to see what they reveal on tonight's livestream! They just want to annoy box makers even more each campaign! Seriously, I have no idea how they convinced them to have (FAKE) hair! ^"Cheetah Cub" @Hi, they don't want to repeat themselves, so no. How is everyone? So...can the box cry when it's opened? Kinda like exploting kittens? Oatmeal Yeah, our conversations just temporarily found new summer homes, but after today, they'll come back here for good. And probably more on the EK side as well. @BHH: It might not be the same eight people now, but it's tons of people that have only commented once, and that was to either vote or suggest a name I don't mind more people commenting, I just hope they'll stop voting ;) It's no longer just the same eight(?) Ppl commenting that's for sure I feel like our comment section has been invaded I can dream, can't I? ;) ^"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, lol. ... Like anyone who is still voting will actually read any of the other posts here. Bear Grills EVERYONE! VOTING IS OVER! VOTING ENDED LIKE AN HOUR AGO! Oatmeal Harambear ! Oatmeal!

I don't know if this is a benefit for me or not yet XD Lady Bearington please Oatmeal @Mike - yes, KickStarter exclusive - and , yes, it's faux fur. :) Was thinking Lady Oatphelia of whatever , might be a good compromise, Ophelia meaning 'help", in Greek , but there is the matter of a specific Ophelia via a certain collection of English playrights, collectively known under one name, that has cast a bit of a shadow on the name.

Whoohoo on all the great Bear name submissions, looking forward to the voting on 4 names selected in a bit and reveal of her new grand Bear name tomorrow and that to be awesomest live session for end of a grand campaign once again by the BvB team. Big Shout Out to all the ones who have helped keep track of, pull, wrangle and excel spreadsheet the list of ALL the bear name submissions: Amanda A Aether Tower dns12999 "Dave The Quack" Evan "Dr. Potatten™" Jibberjabber Mike Kabala "Cheetah Cub" Steff 'Ginger Cub' Micah "Zem the Mattress" Philson I agree Lucas! This game is going to be awesome! I cant wait! Yup, name suggestions are over. Although that was already suggested. I'm pretty sure name suggestions are over adam willis Bearock Obama for the bear name! Do you guys know if the fur box is going to be exclusive to this kickstarter campaign? Will it be available at retail after? Here soon, we'll find out. Whoopie! Ok so when do we get to vote on the top 3? And how will we do it? I'm excited to see what the new name reveal will be! I know the top three at least. It's all good! Pretty excited for the results. But you came in just in time for the final voting @Joe ;) just by a few minutes Joe. Sorry! Lol looks like I showed up late for the party! Oops. Other names also had requested downvotes (looking at you Beary McBearface), but those were not counted. Josie for "name a bear". It just popped into my head as soon as I saw her photo. And don't forget: 1 name got 1 downvote (Bear Pineapple Apple Bear) Am I right @Zem? XD Fun facts: 18 names got 10+ votes 8 names got 20+ votes 3 names got 80+ votes When will voting go up 2774 total votes were cast for 1673 names! Or Bearny Daisy Bearnarda Bearmitzva Bearonica Bearina Black Bear FARBEAR - Forest Animal Rescue Beauty Enhances Additional Rescues Bearginia Hashtag Bearberella Minerbear winding down! Oatmeal is such an appropriate name Nine! I mean minutes; please don't name the bear Nine. Not that it's a bad name... name the bear Black Betty Bam Ba Lam Bearnie Sanders Unity bear Bearnie Sanders! lol :P All that matters right now is being in the top few - it's not voting time yet. I know... but you know, you could just slip a few extras into Oatmeal. Just for fun, you understand! I agree Zem! Don't worry, I'm keeping track of repeats. Can't vote twice! I do love Oatmealia McBearface the Destructor, but I know it won't go far, unfortunately. So Oatmeal it is! (i've already voted for it at least 6 times, so don't worry about it;) I think that Matilda is a great name for the bear I'm also a fan of non-bear-pun names. Comments are tallied with less than 30 minutes left for suggestions. @Kristina: yes to Ruth Bader Ginsbear! I tend to support the non-bear-pun names, but this was too good. :) Grizzly Mcguire Ruth Bader Ginsbear Bearya Stark Ursa Kitt Suggested variations on "Oatmeal" include Oatmealia McBearface the Destructor / Oatmeal / Oats / Baby Oatmeal McBearface / Baby Oatmeal / Oatsoana / Bebalee Oats / Lady Harambear McBearface the 3rd of Oatslandia, AKA Beary / Lady Oatmeal von Bearington of the Florida Bearingtons / Miss Oatmeal / Miss Oatmeal Honeypot / Oat Bear / Oatmeal Bearenstein / Oatmeal Cream Pie / Oatmeal Jr / Oatmeal Latte / Oatmeal McOatmealface / Oatmeal von Bearodactyl but he goes by Oatie / Oats E Lee; aka Oatsie / Oatsa / Oattie (comments tallied) my vote is for Oatmeal There have been a few variations on Oatmeal/Oats. Comments tallied! Furgus Bearington, first of his/her name @Kathryn: There was also Oatsoana that was suggested. >.> Bearniece Oats 53 minutes left to get your name suggestions in! Indeed. Quite a long ways. @Hung - Yup, it's fake fur! ^"Cheetah Cub" You've got a long way to go. Oats only has three votes tallied ... 4 including yours. Please don't kill any real bears for this, use good quality fake fur! Or I can volunteer my chin hair, it's proven to be a super strong babies repellent ! ^_^ I think Oats is a great variation on the name Oatmeal. One more vote for Oats! ^"Cheetah Cub" @Poz, go for it! What you put on your body is up to you. Put the needle where your mouth is. ;-) ... Not literally, though. :-O @Mike thanks! I can see why spelling seems very important in the context of board game tattoos. Although beers vs babbys would still be a rad tattoo, if you want my 2 cents. That's actually another name that's been suggested (although only by a few people): Oats. @CB: They can call her Oats for short. Me too! I'm definitely a fan. (comments tallied) ^"Cheetah Cub" I'm glad to see that Oatmeal is in second place, behind Beary McBearface. I think it would be a much more appropriate name. Bear-ack Obama Don't feel unoriginal! With 246 "Beary McBearface" suggestions, two is FAR from unoriginal. @Amanda :D I do like it too. Although I feel rather unoriginal now lol All comments are tallied - Shannon was actually suggested once before. I like it. ^"Cheetah Cub" I still don't understand why a Bear would want to be named after a Direwolf, and yes, I am familiar with the Temple of the Many Faced God. We're all nameless until our Naming Day. I think a great name would be Penelope ^"Cheetah Cub" @Poz, that's not how you spell sergeant. Bea Rarthur I really hope the name fits the bear. It would be a shame to give a name that doesn't fit her well :( Sargent Cuddleton ^"Cheetah Cub" New name totals: <url>"Cheetah Cub" Oatmeal Much as I love "Grizabella", I'm also throwing my support behind Porridge. Just to mess with Aether, I suggest Bear Pineapple Apple Bear. Beartha the Bear CUDDLES !!! A great name for a bear !!! I'm digging Porridge too :D I'll throw my support behind Porridge (Oatmeal is a bit on the nose and not as cute.) and Mato. Also any suggestions involving "Princess" or "Queen". I believe in showing respect for those who could beat you to a pulp if you don't. Guuuyyysss, She should be called Porridge. The Oatmeal...the the 3 bears and their Porridge...it'd be adorable. Bear-ded Clam LGBearT and sometimes Q ^"Cheetah Cub" Updated bear name list: <url>"Baby". Unless that name has already been nominated. In which case you can call this a vote. The NSFW tier also includes a SFW deck with the booster pack. @David: The card comes with all copies of the SFW deck, so it is KS exclusive but not tier exclusive. @Aether - I agree! I've done my anthem, I'd love to see some others though! (comments tallied) Sorry if the question has already been answered, but I just wanted to make sure: the NSFW reward still comes with the backer exclusive card - correct? Thanks! We still have one day and it would be cool to unlock the rousing speeches (video recorded) and the tank babies!! Cmoonnnn 80k I like @GM's idea of Oatsoanna haha Re: Name the Bear...UBLB (acronym for "Un-Bearable Lightness of Bearing.") UBLB is also something that a baby might utter before being left as a wet, red smear on the forest floor by a bear named UBLB 1648 unique names, 2718 total votes :) Yup, fur is fake. Oatmeal is now in second place for most-suggested name. (these aren't the final votes though). Comments tallied! Don't Rock the Bear Beary Sanders Lady Orso Can you imagine explaining that to the insurance company? "We had no idea he was allergic to _________ ". Hey, I think I'm adding that to my CaH deck. Never mind the possible allergies that would be provoked. Thanks :) just checking! Fur is fake! They are, as they said, not monsters. @BvB, Silly question, but is the fur on the boxes going to be real or fake? Bearbra streisand Upvote for Oatmeal the bear A bear named Bearcules(pronounced like Hercules) would be most exquisite Yay for bear rescue! I'm naming her Priscilla Popplebottom. You can call her Miss Priss if you want to; but I will continue to call her Priscilla Popplebottom. Bearachuda Brian. Baby Face McBearenstein Bearllary ! Name the bear Ms. Gritz! Also, the project updates for this game are what get me through the days at my insanely boring job. Bärnsten Björn Bearnie McBabiechops Bearbie I like the name Pookie Bear. @Paul - I think that'd be awesome. (comments tallied) @Elan No, 76K is showing off. ;-) Medved (Czech for bear - she looks like a Czech bear) Baxter Oatsoana(oats-wanna) for the lovely lady. I just hope one of the bear cards is a baby with a bear mask on that says "totally not a baby" Crumple the bear. What about Bauble? I think Bärbel (pronounced barble) is a lovely Name for this cute bear lady And with 30 hours still to go! (comments tallied) Boaty McBoatface! Oatmeal. (duh) Guzman !!! Bella VonHindenburg! er, not counting Ferris's two. Will get those in right now. All tallied up! 1632 unique name suggestions, of 2689 votes in total. Esther Lester For bears names I meant Bearack Obearma ... silly autocorrect How about the Lakota word for bear, Mato, or black bear, Matosapa Barack Obearma We did it ! Mike, thanks for the Cub and everything, and thanks to everyone that kept this comment section alive ! Backed early, but commented in the end. Can't wait for the fur to begin: Regarding names, Oatmeal ! Bhalu the bear! Lisa "Bear Eye" Lopes Joseph brings up a good point. Why aren't there a ton of variations of Paddington?! @Kathryn - Thanks! Count was slightly off because there were some duplicates I missed. But getting it better and better as I go. Bearington VonBlackBear LaRoux ^"Cheetah Cub" I'd really prefer a lot fewer bear names that are basically just taken from someone's favorite celebrity. Baloo Paddington III I need a time machine... June can't come soon enough :-/ ^"Cheetah Cub" We now have 36 achievements! Definitely overachievers: <url>"Um-bear-toe" or some variant has already been suggested, but hey... just in case. Alexander Bearilton Princess LuvUBearyMuch @Jason, don't worry. Read previous comments; it's going to be fake. In their words, "We're not monsters." @Michah I knew the Cubs winning the series was a sign of the zombie apocalypse. :P Next arbitrary goal: # million is already only 180K away! :P No, it is not real fur. . <url>… . <url>"Baby" is a bearfect name for her! Felicity. Why not. Harumbear Ive alredy suggested Sherambe vote for me :) Schnoz Frozzler! Name her BE ARthur Bear Names: Beary Manilow Bearverly Clearasilly Bearack Obama -> Yes, We Can. This user's account has been deleted. Thanks Evan. I guess I missed that. @Evan thanks for the link, I missed that! That was from teh FAQ section @Morgenstond: We want these cards to be the highest quality we can afford so we've been testing a bunch of different options. Our favorite so far is a 300 gsm, Japanese blue core, linen embossed, plastic coated. These are amazing cards and really durable. The decision is not final yet as we're also testing a french black core 300-310 gsm for quality. what if i dont want fur on my game? lol With all the effort going into the packaging, I hope the card quality will also be better than exploding kittens was. Those cards faded fast! Lady McSnorgals (her nose!) bear name: CamenBear 75k backers, I'm tweeting ...err... growling that on Twitter. I mean, Growler. Also I upvote oatmeal for the bear's name @Roo!! how have you been?! long time no see! Bearnice Sanders On a non fur related note if we keep this pace up we may hit 75k backers today! @Evan thanks LOL I'm on cold meds so I'm super slow today :D Baby.. "PS: While this is fur real, the fur is faux. We're not monsters." Their FB post about the new box states it's "faux fur" Also found on twitter. <url>"fur real", not real fur. They used the word fur in place of for. That is how I'm reading it. BEAR NAME: Baxter @Jenn B Roo: can you cite me the place you read the word faux so we can get it posted here and in the update log as well. ^"Cheetah Cub" @GAMEHOLDER, they already said that a roaring box isn't going to happen, because it would have been too similar to the Meowing box for EK. comments tallied! so many names out there! They are using fake fur :) they even said "faux" which means fake :) Arya Stark Remember folks, this is the name suggestion faze! Keep them coming! Voting will be done after they have the names in! @Reverant hope it does As far as names go, Oatmeal is closing in on Harambear for the first round (just to get some name ideas out). 1669 unique suggestions so far! (comments tallied) Good catch @evan! Sorry for the misinformation The name should be Arya Stark since a bear has no name. Oh, thanks for that Wes! @evan <url>üno Barry Bär ManBearPig Donald Snuggly Snoop Bearr Mr. President Stephen Bearskin @Kelly Schulz: They are all over social media. Easiest to search those sites (FB, IG, Twitter) for the hastag. #bearsvsbabies So probably? Snootles. Anyone get the Design Session LiveStream to do its magic, beyond a few minutes? :) @Angela: <url>"Baby" ... so she will always be Baby Bear. Bear name: Boople Snoot @wes - mind citing that? Beary McBearface. obviously. According to the oatmeal twitter its "real fur" Bear Name: Ivana Notha Bear name: Valhalla (as in that's what's waiting on the inside of her mouth hole for all those courageous babies). "Ruth Bear Ginsbaby" In honor of our last liberal justice if he Supreme Court. Bear name: Seth Rogen I step away for an hour and WOW lots of new names! Lots of fun ones floating around! (comments all tallied) I'm pretty sure it's faux fur. Real fur/skin has a certain thickness and tenacity, that wouldn't amend itself to tight edges and folding, at least not without a lot of hand-work. @Deanna Root: I VERY highly doubt they are going to use real fur. If not because the oatmeal seems to care for animal rights, then because that would be ridiculously expensive. ^"Cheetah Cub" How about BOTUS, "Bear Of The United States?" People please do speeches(see <url>"Beary Manilow". ^"Cheetah Cub" Yeah, I would imagine it would be fake fur, because they're promoting animal rescue. A confirmation about that would be a good idea though. Bear name: Nahele. Well, iPhone thinks "analy electrocuted" should be "snarky electrocuted". If only that were true. ^"Cheetah Cub" @PC, except it will be really hard to fond 600 more "I voted" photos. Please tell me it's fake fur for the box otherwise I want to cancel my pledge. I don't condone unnecessary cruelty to animals (fur animals are either skinned alive or snaky electrocuted), and also imagine some people would have allergy issues, as even processed fur still carries allergens. Should name the bear "Norman". we wont unlock the last vote one Just a touch more than 900 more backers needed to unlock the 75K achievement - might as well unlock 'em all! ;) Thyra Björn - It loosely translates to "Thunder Bear" in Old Norse. Bear Name: Sniffy McCrackscratch Bearriet Tubman! Yep, that's awesome. Glad I saw that one. Now there are at least 3 votes for this name, yes? Ohplease ohplease ohplease Baby :) ^"Cheetah Cub" The situation has been corrected. Amanda A is now officially part of the crew. <url>"Devourer of Babies" Ben jibbers crabst Mathew Inman My kids vote for "Fluffy". Beary Mcbearface or Harambe UPDATE #9 is official folks, time for a refresh. Wohoo the last stretch goal is unlocked! :) Pam! Name her Pam! Just because, it has no meaning. I just like Pam. Beary McBabyface I'm honestly surprised she isn't on the list @CB. I would ask her if she wants to do so first though. "Bearriet Tubman" all the way! ^"Cheetah Cub" Hey, I just noticed that @Amanda A isn't on the crew roster. Is it OK if I draft her as midshipman? Hahaha facedropper!!! Thanks for that! @CB as MVC seconded :D ^"Cheetah Cub" And, as you can see, whenever I'm not chasing my tail trying to keep things up to date, I make my own mischief around here. I guess it's best to keep me busy. BearClaw Oh okay, just clarifying GM. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Aether, except group photos. I don't have 50 friends who don't think I'm crazy. And btw, I haven't had the chance until now to express how much I admire you for keeping that Name page updated (as well as all the CubSubCorps page). There are a lot of backers that had done a LOT for the fun and goals of this campaign, but for me, you are the MVC (Most Valuable Cub) of this campaign for that and the tattoo. You were also the 1st one to submit a rousing speech! (Imagine if you had a cat, a pomeranian or a baby at hand, you would have submitted in all categories!) How about River after River Tam. Cute but dangerous! ^"Cheetah Cub" @Dr.P, I xomments was coined by Owen "Great Mountain" Middleton during the first few days of this KickStarter. I hope we can name this lady bear after the Lady Bear herself, Lyanna. @Dr.P: That would be me who came up with that one. Please name the bear Bearbarella. If not, how about these, since other people like them; Oatmeal Ursula So...our boxes are tribbles? @CB great dictionary haha Where did we get xomments from.... This is the first time i've been able to really read the dictionary. Thumbs up on all accounts. Bear Name Suggestion: ***Bearriet Tubman*** (Short story - there are 5 of us at my office who took up a collection to back this project so we can play the game in our conference room over lunch breaks.) I approve @CB ^"Cheetah Cub" That was just too good not to add, so I made an executive decision. <url>"Cheetah Cub" I would like to ammend my previous post. facedropper: A person who makes only one comment throughout the campaign to suggest "Something McSomethingface" as, "the obvious choice" for a bear name. or something like that? I think that has another meaning @CB.... let's go with the hit-and-runner, or the one-pump-chump ^"Cheetah Cub" I propose a new entry for the CubSub dictionary. Namedropper: A person who makes only one comment throughout the campaign to suggest "Something McSomethingface" as, "the obvious choice" for a bear name. Or to clean the screen of our laptops! Hey! Just saw the update! Congratulations! We did it!! now we will have a fluffy box to use as a pillow!!! :D XD I suggest naming her "Bentley" I've always loved that name, but the definition (which I just looked up today) is perfect. ---> "....referring to a clearing covered with coarse grass. ex: From the bent grass meadow..." It is pretty masculine but, then again she could eat your face if she wanted. Beary McKillface Duchess Carmilla Von Dangerfloofen Maybe I could throw some name suggestions into the mix. Just rattling things off the top of my head: Slam-Master Henrietta Dangerroar Hyperawesome Robo-Bear 2000 Infinite Turbo Bearjammer Bear name suggestions: Bearbra, Babs for short. It's probably been suggested already, but I recommend Callisto. What about Beary McBearface Thunderfloof Even though we got 35 I'd like to get a few more! Can anyone do baby tanks? Can anyone do a speech? Please see here if you want a pre-written speech make sure it is video and you include the #BearsVsBabies in the video <url>"Ms. Nibbles" So, do we get another SG if we unlock ALL of the goals? Another good question Cub-Cake! Creeper, good question. Is the fur ambidextrous? Can you use sleeves? Is the fur scratch and sniff? @pottaten- is polka Dottie an official description of fur? I support it! Beary McBearyface! *STRETCH (No. 3) es and slowly blinks*" Hey, Ms. Brisb - your house is moved!?!" "It's a FREE CONCERT from now on (Needed $20 and $35 deposits, non-refundable)" "YOU GET A FUZZY BOX1 AND YOU GET A FUZZY BOX! YOU ALL GET FUZZY BOXES!" She looks like a Snuffles to me. Or Sophie. For the bear name: Ms. Nibbles @Robert: Bet you didn't wake up thinking that you would say that, now did you? Also, there is an Elan update below!!! HUZZAH: . . Elan Lee 2-time creator Superbacker 26 minutes ago Good morning! We have officially counted all the things to count and are THRILLED to announce that you've unlocked 35 achievements. This means that thanks to you amazing people ALL THE BOXES WILL BE COVERED IN FUR! (and we love you a lot even though our manufacturers don't) We'll post an official announcement shortly, but I wanted to share the good news here first! Amazing job guys! Wow! Just what I wanted a Furry Box!! lol Grizabella That is a great question Cub-Cake! Also, is it all one color (pink hopefully) or plaid? Maybe polka-dottie? Lady Bearington ^"Cheetah Cub" ... Everyone ... Is the fur EU friendly? Lulu! That bear is a Lulu if ever I saw one. ^"Cheetah Cub" veryone probably already knows this by now, but we finally reached Stretch Goal 3! Here are our new official totals: <url>#BearsVsBabies in the video <url>"Cub-Cake" Nicole just now We've unlocked beard babies, provokes and pumpkins!!! Wahoo!!! < Huzzah! oh wait! wrong again! unlocked provokes as Cub Cake said!! haha oh wait, I think pumpkins is already unlocked! so 1 more baby provoke please! haha @DtQ it's been great!! we are working on keep updating the campaign page, but once we are done with that we will start to focus on fun things for the backers ;) (voting/challenges/streams/etc) Woohoo! I'm glad my pumpkin party was a success!!! (comments are tallied) Fluffy McBearington Georgia, Penelope, Cleo We've unlocked beard babies, provokes and pumpkins!!! Wahoo!!! Snuggle Pumpkin (from Iron Druid series) Justin are you still going to do your speech? @Aether hows it going over at Trickster? I'd like people to keep in mind this is a FEMALE bear and as such should probably get at least a neurtal or preferably feminine name @aether nice! Misha, Gracie, Dakota, Nova I think we need only 1 more baby PROVOKE and 1 BvB PUMPKIN to be sure about unlocking that one Captain Nostrils. I'm not sure when we got an unoffical update though as to avoid confusion only one person is in charge of tracking it and he just launched his own Kickstarter yesterday @Ian checkout the fan page here for our offical and estimated counts <url>"Blackberry" of course! (could be stylized as "Blackbeary") We're waiting on official counts from the powers that be Bear-o-dactyl We still need to focus on baby provokes, pumpkins, speeches. Looks like we should get the 75k backers, so that's good! how often is <url>♥ @Sarah awww how cute ^^ I second the Name Bunny Name the bear: Fluffy McFlufflesnuff Hi. I'm B Huggies Current rate of growth puts us at 75k in roughly nine hours! I suggest the name Ursa for the bear. Yes, i know its naming a bear "bear" but i think its cute. When she is small, she can be called Ursa Minor. Then when she gets older she can be called Ursa major. :) And the fact she got rescued and her life is not being spent in cramped quarters, she probably feels like she has the whole universe at her paws. Goooooood morning Vietnam!!! ... err, wrong place :P Morning all! @Creeper: That would be an awesome picture! Good morning (again) that is! Morning cubs. Just got back from walking my cat. Good morning all! Comments are 100% tallied!

Barry McBearenstein I vote Miss Oatmeal Honeypot Midge Name for bear: Necessity As in the bear necessity Oatmeal Bearoncé @Alpha - It's currently in fourth on the polls. I also like Oatmeal :) Mattilda Elaine (in honor of you guys) or Beatrice Bunny McBearface (good suggestions in here!) I still like my suggestion of Stephanie ColBear (the godless killing machine). However, if it is not on the final poll I will certainly vote Oatmeal over Beary McBearface. @Justin - awesome! :D Vote for Harambear and Beary McBearface @gc we're on track to hit 75k by the end of the day at current rate of new backers. Someone posted a New provoke <url>"Strawbeary" We're getting ever closer to 75,000 backers... Name suggestion convo from my 3-yr old daughter Pearl: "Peacock would be good, but Bunny would be better because she looks like a bunny." I concur. Let her be dubbed "Oatmeal." Beariana I say your name is Honeynose - because of all the blonde hair around its face :) Snuggles Beary McBearface I definitely vote for Oatmeal!!! My vote is for Oatmeal! @ glenn could be. who knows. i still hope there is another secret goal besides the hairy box :D Babycakes This is where it lists the 3rd stretch goal of the furry box <url>"surprise", so it looks like we're getting it whether it's officially "unlocked" or not. There's no rule saying they can't just give it to us if they want, and apparently that's what they decided to do. We're on track to unlock 75k backers. We are only 3 unlocked goals from 35 goals unlocked. If some of you will help with the provoke, pumpkin, or beard baby goals, we can unlock the hairy boxes and Justin it says nowhere that the furry box are the last goal. the link says every box without reaching any goal. or nor? <url>� Besty Who here would want to be called Person McPerson face?? Really. I vote for Oatmeal and Harambear Am I the only one who noticed that as of last night, Matt said that we WILL be getting the fur-covered boxes? <url>"bright one"). It makes sense and it's whimsical. Also she does have a Beartha face, that's super clear. Bear name: Umbra Sgt. Donny Donowitz Name it Hashtag. So every time someone says hashtag we think of the work they are doing for this bear and the others. Bear Name: Sir Reginald von TruffleBottoms 3rd Jacqueline H'ghar A girl bear needs a name.

She lumbered on by and where went the short-faced bear? Twelve thousand years dead Baroness Please provoke your babies, your friends babies, anyone's babies! I think we need 1 more or are done with pumpkins I think Aether should have waited till this was over to launch his... We could use an unofficial update! How about Babe Collin Firth Snuggles McCuddlemuffins! Definitely! I would be nervous too. Comments tallied! It took us all campaign to get to UK something comments now we're at 10,340 after this name thing To be fair she's apparently really nervous about baby sitting in the first place I would recommend the name for the bear: "Bearminator"! haha :D Yeah, that sounds right. Comments tallied! She promised a provoke and a beard...I told her to try for a tank but she didn't think she'd have time Then it must be Alison Though as night as an idea as it is for humid sake long term I don't know how I feel about a furry box TBH Bear name- Beary Potter Twas not me - I don't have any babies in my life. This is stressful Only 2,318 bracket to 75,000! @barb ask the money going there is their own money. This money goes to this project Bear name - Rusty Was it you Amanda it Allison that was going to watch their nephew and try and get pics? Teddy McBearface Fluffy McFluffins <url>#BearsVsBabies is in the photo(no Photoshop) 2) speeches are video(audio may be accepted too) 3) bear on belly must be drawn directly on the belly no photos or stuffed animals) Beary Mcbearface I am too Quack! Comments all counted and up-to-date. The bear is so sweet looking. I think the name Sugar suits her. P.s. With over $2.7 million pledged, seems like some charitable contributions wouldn't be a bad idea. Oatmeal is lovely or Bearberella :) I'm excited our buddy Aether's project got funded If you want the furry box you need to do streach goals NO Streach Goals = NO FURY BOX Th please provoke babies, carve/decorate BvB pumpkins and beard Babies those are the ones were closest to! Someone suggested Ruth Ginsbear, I would go with that one. Though I'm unsure of the one in the glass with the ribbon The new ones look good Yes I don't know why those didn't count yesterday :( @Quack - there's a fair number of new pumpkins up. 8 yesterday (five that counted - not sure what was wrong with other ones) and 5 today. Hopefully they all count. Yea Elan broke the comments Well, after 8 hours of destroying myself on the thousands of comments, they slowed down enough to keep up on now. Less chaosy now. There's two(maybe 3 but that last one is a streach) new pumpkins up Just checking in on the chaos! Nuwanda the Bear I vote Oatmeal, and it would be great to get a picture of her eating some I'm here too :) @Quack - I'm here, counting comments for the umpteenth hour. Sup? *Members Funshine Bear! Any corps memoirs here? If you want the furry box you need to do streach goals NO Goals = NO FURy BOX Th please provoke babies, carve/decorate BvB pumpkins and beard Babies those are the ones were closest to! Lucille!

Over 1500 unique names, and 2366 total votes in! We still need your help with stretch goals though! We are sooo close on unlocking the fabulous possibly furry box upgrade. Please help by completing the challenges!! We are so very close on 3 stretch challenges specifically: Provoke a Baby - 4 needed BvB themed pumpkin - 5 needed Beard Baby - 5 needed Please don't forget to include a handwritten note with #bearsvsbabies in your picture submissions!! We can do it!! :) I think Oatmeal is a great suggestion! :-) Harambear Name: Fluffles McFly Name of the bear is clearly Snuffy "Giant Racoon" with reference to a great movie, Swiss Army Man ! Jeor Mormont, after the Old Bear. Or simply, Mormont. Berestain Bear Beary McBearface As a chemist, the obvious suggestion is Professor Bearium. And I second Elaine's suggestion: Oatmeal Fitting for a bear - inspired by either the fairy tale or some random person of no particular relevance to this Kickstarter... Bear name: Ignignokt Name the bear: Beartastic Arcadia (bear + fantastic, Arcadia was derived from the word arktos, meaning "bear") Name the bear: Beartastic Arcadia Sanders (short for Bearnie Sanders, not Colonel...) Though I like the idea of Grylls... How about Grryls after the famous man himself. Beary McBearFace I mean Beartie McBeartface is the obvious choice. Darth Bearder or Bearth Vader Berry McKochner Mr. Sniffles Missus Snifflesworth name suggestion: Snuffles Bearbarella Bear-0-weenie I would like to suggest the name 'Andrea'. It's not a fancy name, but it comes with a background. My ex-girlfriend (who is now my closest friend) is called Andrea. She is a part of my life for many years and one of the kindest and most wearm-hearted people I ever met. Her nickname is the German word 'Mausebär', which translates to something like 'Mouse-Bear' and refers to some cute, none-existing fluff-ball. As a shortform, she ist mostly called 'The Bear'. I think it would make her very happy to be the eponymist for this furry creature. Oatmeal! Jibbers. Namesuggestion: Bruinhilde Please all read @Cha!'s comment below! We are so close to the stretch goals, but we need your help! Suggestion: Princess Fluffybutt (or just Fluffybutt for short) Also I second the suggestion from Fabio G Calzada: [Lady Bera Teddington-McFluffy] Suggestions: Snozzie Bear Princess Beartrice... then we pit her up against Beatrice and they fight to the death! :D Hazel or Lusela. We are sooo close on unlocking the fabulous possibly furry box upgrade. Please help by completing the challenges!! We are so very close on 3 stretch challenges specifically: Provoke a Baby - 4 needed BvB themed pumpkin - 5 needed Beard Baby - 5 needed Please don't forget to include a handwritten note with #bearsvsbabies in your picture submissions!! We can do it!! :) Lady Bearington Name the bear Beartice (if it's a girl) or Beartie (if it's a guy) Bear name: Cutie McBearface Bear name: Assuming emoticons aren't allowed... Hillary or Brexit and what about Bearenice? "Beeveebee" which is not exactly short for Bears Vs Babies Bearicus Maximus I dontnhave a baby or any pumpkins or a pet or bears or talent for dioramas so cant really help but Geoffrey is the best nane for a bear Great names guys! Now PLEASE help us out with the stretch goals!!! Any good Hitler Reacts videos for this yet? <url>"Oatmeal". Y'all are bringing so much bizarre love and joy to the world, you deserve the homage more than anyone! Bearbarella. She may not be as lovely as Jane Fonda back in the day, but she's a good looking bear. Elinor (An ode to Merida's mam in Brave) Piper Bearnice Or Bernardine which to my chagrin, means "Brave little Bear" Bearon of Tarth I like Ramona, it sounds both reckless and sexy! Beary McBearface (Of course) Simone de Bearvoir How about Lady Bearington von Grizzly Harambear Bearodactyl Beary McBearFace Charles Bearwin David Attenbear. Oatmeal Harambear The Bear With No Name Yes that is a Clint Eastwood reference. Beefa. As in B fa Bear. Please don't forget to do stretch goals! Brenda. Bearnadette ^"Cheetah Cub" That's all of the totals that will be posted until this morning. I'll see you all in a few hours. Good night. I'm for “Lyanna Mormont” and “Stephanie Colbear”. ^"Cheetah Cub" A new bear name tally has been posted: <url>"Ursula Sine" Lady Bera Teddington-McFluffy Oatbear ! Biscuit Call the bear Oatmeal. I still like Stephanie Colbear Susan It's gotta be Bear McBearface Lyanna McBearface Baby Protector Bear His awesome treatment at the shelter made him weak for human beings, and I believe he wants to give back to us by protecting those Who need it the most. Beer Nikolas Tesla's wife Lyanna Mormont Lyanna For everyone suggesting "Beary McBearface", this is why we have Trump as President-elect. The Bearenstain Bear. "Versus" the ursus. Bear Withme Beary MacBearface Beary Poppins Beary McBearface Beary McBearface Beary McBearface Gitchegumee Big Ol' Furry Britches Beartha Bearen McPaw Wing Commander Von FluffyFace Emanuel Roger Eric auf Bahnhof de Miel Bearenstain Von Babysnacker @Everybody - I've been hard at work all day tallying every single comment on this page. We've had over 1500 unique name suggestions. The highest ranking name has over 200 votes for it. It's been a LONG day. But now, I can get some sleep, and then get back to the count in the morning! :D Rest assured, your votes have been counted! @thomas- awh! Now that's sweet! Ursula : means "little bear" This is Super off subject but my cat managed to open my trash can (foot pedal open). Dig out a tiny piece of foil that had tuna on it (I don't know how- it's a tall trashcan) -and has been playing with it for an hour. I'm just really impressed, that's all. Snuffles! @James wise words! "Oatmeal" I don't want to be the person who might uncaringly burden a bear with a bizzaro name for the rest of her natural life. "Oatmeal" pays tribute to a fine illustrator and is a sweet, cute and disarming name for a cuddly ball of fur intent on rending, limb from bloody limb, smearing entrails across the floor an devouring the remains of evil baby horrors at every opportunity.

Just in time, getting two of my relatives on board the pumpkin-making-train! WOOOOOO! hahaha that's is so AWESOME! Sorry I took a few extra minutes, but it's good to see the place hasn't burned down. Well, I haven't refreshed the page yet, so for all I know, you could have summoned one of the Ancient Ones. Please don't let it be Cthulhu again! Wow, 20 comments. Someone needs a hobby! Or they have one, and it's this. OMG I'm so excited @Amanda twitter, same name, roguebaron And yes the 3rd stretch goal is the crazy box Very exciting Tanguy I think more people should wait to find out. It's the easiest way of ensuring the 3rd stretch goal I guess. Beard I'm not sure he can though, needs material ! Allison see what you can do. I understand watching babies is time consuming as is! If we can get provokes and beards I think we'll have it in the bag I'll try to ask my friend who has a 3 weeks old little human if they could send me a provoke picture. @Dave: Mini-me (or her ? Surprise it will be) is due by the 10th of January..! That'll be our first one so quite impatient but a looooot of unknown. So is the box the oatmeal talked about the stretch goal we're working on? I don't think I'll have enough time to do the tank oh that' makes more sense I think she said 8 week old someone claimed to have posted a provoke which would make it three if it's acceptable but no one here can find it :( please copy away justin! 8 y/o may be a little old to be concidered a baby Copied from @DtQ cuz I'm like that Here's what we need(include #BearsVsBabies in the photo video you can't edit it in): 4 Baby provokes 5 Bear Vs Baby pumpkins 5 Beard Babies 17 baby tanks 15 rousing speeches/anthems(video format) 17 bears on pregnant(must be drawn on the belly) and tank! Im facing my fear of babies and watching my 8 w/o nephew tomorrow so I can get my provoke and beard pictures in Well, time to go get food real quick. You're on your own for a few minutes. Hope you don't get too lonely in that time. I know how scawy it can get in here! 3 rapid-fire consecutive comments of few words, and those decreasing sequentially? Truly you've discovered the way of the spam! True Zem decorate a pumpkin record a video of a speech Well, Dave, like I said, I didn't eat breakfast either, so this is even more technically breakfast for me. go find a baby definitly Kelvin if everyone does as much as they can Well, to be honest, it's not a chatroom, it's a comment section, we're just the weird people here. This kind of stuff should be in a community tab or something, while comments are left for reviews, but comments here is the only place you can comment, so comment we do! wake up eat breakfast...sound logic! 3 more stretch goals, is it possible? Time for breakfast! That's how it works, right? It's a little late, but even at 2:30 pm it's breakfast to me! Most people don't seem to see this as a chatroom and just disappear after one comment which is very frustrating Welcome back to the land of the concious Zem There. If ~5 hours of sleep won't stave off the tiredness, how about 5 hours of sleep AND a 3 1/2 hour nap? That should about do it for this week! Throw in a pot of coffee and I won't need to go to sleep until Christmas! and if it's FB make sure it's a public post! I didn't see it. did you include the #BearsVsBabies in your tweet or FB post? @Roguebaron - awesome! Where at? posted a provoke a baby pic today, we should only need 3 more..... @Quack - Well, all of my friends went up last night. Sadly only 5 of the 8 pumpkins that got posted last night qualified for the count. #BearsVsBabies has been dead today...only one update on twitter and none on FB :( BTW when is Tangal due? I didn't mean to surpass how could you with the fine art and superb model. Just something to aspire too! Mine is not possible to surpass :D I feel that's a bit too subjective ? <url>#BearsVsBabies in the photo video you can't edit it in): 4 Baby provokes 5 Bear Vs Baby pumpkins 5 Beard Babies 17 baby tanks 15 rousing speeches/anthems(video format) 17 bears on pregnant(must be drawn on the belly) Welcome aboard Tzukasa so i am convinced. i am also in. i backed <3 :D hope we will catch the last goal =) No problem...it seemed like the proper thing to do though I don't think I have the musical knowledge you do I'll do what I can *salutes Cha!* Good man! @Quack :) :) :) Cha! I'm a backer as well! Thank you @Quack for taking over the musical baton :) I don't know I thought they were all great! Plugboost alert, avert your eyes if you don't wanna see it. Our friend Aether just started his 'Trickster' Kickstarter campaign and I supported it. Looks like a fun game very worth checking out. :) @Quack - I certainly am! I wonder which pumpkin from yesterday didn't count, I thought our unofficial was 21. Either way, I have high hopes for that! Since Cha! has left this is a song I listen to when I need a burst of energy Blur - Song 2 <url>#classiccreeper Hi hi! I know you're busy don't you worry the CubSub Corps will get it done! Cub Cake! Hi all- checking in briefly. Thanks for all your help! Get those pumpkins! Text friends with babies- the provoke is quite easy to accomplish! @Amanda ask them! @Ashley, Elan - Thanks! Good to know! For once I wish I knew a baby. Maybe I can get my parents to do a pumpkin, I know they had a volunteer pumpkin plant this year, they may still have the pumpkins. Plus only 6,491 more backers to 75,000 @Ashley thanks for the update! @Elan sounds like fun! After the fun I had with the EK campaign BvB would have sounded awful for me to not back it. I would have pledged even for a meh game with this much fun in the campaign! Hi everyone! Here is you morning update: 8 baby tank, 8 baby tank, 20 pumpkins, 20 beard babies, 21 provokes, 368 votes, 1 person dressed in bvb at voting, 8 pregnant belly bear, 10 rousing speech/anthems. 3 goals left. Go for the beard babies, pumpkins, and provokes. You got this! Well that too Eric! Quack, yeah, that's probable, but since the bear was Bear McCreary and the baby was Baby Spice, that might not have been accepted :) It's to bad you had such negative experiences :( Hi HC! @Elan - Thanks for running such a fun campaign. I have backed 8 projects, 6 of which are nothing but negative. This one makes me happy xx I want to blame that miscommunication between team members but can't say for sure. @Justin - Also, on November third, we were told: "You can do multiple entries per category" <url>#comment-14867776 But now we can't, which decreased our numbers in some categories. Eric just cause they didn't post it doesn't mean it wasn't counted! I request a photo of Elan(or at least an Oatmeal drawing) of Elan with the pom poms! Maybe they'll be nice and accept some of the submissions that didn't meet the absolute exact idea behind the achievements. Thinking it was the same reason why my bear vs baby battle wasn't posted (even though that one did get completed). Thanks Elan! *Sends you caffeine* ^"Cheetah Cub" Hello, Cap'n Good morning Elan! Agreed CSC FTW ^"Cheetah Cub" @Justin, I totally agree. If they were going to disqualify posts for using stuffed bears, the requirement should have stated that the bears had to be drawn rather than assume we would all understand. Ditto for the speeches needing to be spoken rather than written down. An update explaining the restrictions would have helped for those backers who never read the comments. The note on Comments says, "Use this space to cheer the creator along, ask questions, and talk to your fellow backers. Please remember to be respectful and considerate. Thanks!" It does not say, "Use this space to explain what the @Creator really meant when listing the stretch goal requirements." It is what it is though and we're doing our best to adjust. Thank goodness for the CubSub Corps! luckily some people owned farms... It's true...You don't know how many goat selfies were disqualified because of the lack of the hashtag...People went out of their way to go to petting zoos/farms and weren't going to go back True. I don't mean to complain, but I feel like these are people who are trying to help with the stretch goals and unless they read through thousands of comments here, they won't know that their efforts won't count. Yea I think they should have at the very least accepted the first belly photo and then updated the rules on the main page. I understand the text for speech since you could in theory(it'd be a long shot) find such a speech online and put the # in it I guess what gets me, is that the verbage for the speeches and for the bellies doesn't specify those rules. So people go to the list of stretch goals, read what it says, and make a post that won't count. My guess is she'll be back sometime after the campaign but for now she is gone :( Zem that's all she said I don't have any more info for you We had the same problem with following rules in Exploding Kittens between forgotten #Update9 plus some people tried using toy batmans in hot tubs or toy spidermans in 1 kyak Wait, Cha makes it sound like she won't be around after the campaign. Just what kind of "stuff going on" is this? @Quack - yes, I saw. It is sad :( @Justin - I completely agree. This is what we have left makes sure to have a sign with #BearsVsBabies in the photo Estimated Counts Remaining Group of 50 people dressed as bears or babies - 1 BvB Themed Pumpkins - 4 Bearded Babies - 5 Provoking Babies - 6 Speeches (must be video(maybe audio) but definitely can't be text)- 15 Babies Dressed As Tanks - 17 Bears DRAWN on a pregnant Belly -18 Now, instead of attempting to catch up on a couple hundred missed comments, I'm going to go back to sleep. Jeez, I'm sorry I ever mentioned the donuts! You'll be happy to know, I'm sure, that I didn't even get breakfast today. In fact, I'm shifting my schedule to make lunch the new breakfast. That may sound wrong, but it actually fits much more nicely. Besides, donuts are like coffee to me; sure, they're good in the morning, but I prefer them in the evening as a snack. Or, in coffee's case, an evening lifeblood, not due to habitually needing a pick-me-up, but due to how much I love coffee. Hoh Lee Carp. It would seem there are a few people with nothing to do. I 'member when I could be around that much, commenting that much! Even in free time now, though, I spend whey more time on youtube and games that I don't comment as frequently anymore. I'm kind of jealous, actually! Belly must be drawn on, speeches in the form of a video, etc Someone posted a pregnant belly pic on twitter but it's a stuffed animal not a drawing :( I feel like we're missing a lot of unlocks because of vague requirements on the official stretch goal page "Have stuff going on so I'm probably going to be quiet rest of campaign. I'm hoping we'all be able to reach the stretch goal and unlock the fabulous mystery box. Great team work everyone. It's been great re-connecting and connecting!!" - Cha! ^"Cheetah Cub" Things to do with babies: 1. Provoke them 2. Give them Beards 3. Dress them up as Tanks 4. Take pictures of all of the above including a handwritten #BEARSVSBABIES hashtag She will be missed on this board I don't know if you saw but Cha! won't be around for a while due to personal stuff going on No problem Amanda If it's not pushing your luck you should ask your wife's friends about dressing them up as tanks as well! 9 hours and two fire alarms later.... Thanks @Quack and @Cha for the pumpkin compliments! Which is 33/35 achievements With your pumpkins we should unlock the pumpkin achievement That is a good contributation Justin! Ok. I have 5 uncarved, undecorated pumpkins on my porch. So that is an easy one. My wife has a few friends who said that they are willing to beardify and provoke. I'll have her ask about tanks as well. She and I will try to get speeches done too. Not sure if I can help with any others At least he doesn't expect it done in an hour! Apparently he "forgot". Mind you, he's more than happy for me to take longer on it, it's just going to be a lot of work ^"Cheetah Cub" New official totals are up on www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html Looks like one of our pumpkins didn't count, but I don't know which one. ^"Cheetah Cub" > Why couldn't he have sent this ages ago @GC, that's just how bosses think. If he'd wanted it ages ago, he'd have asked for it ages ago, but he wants it now, so he waited until now to tell you. Ahh that's better...I discovered I had no more coffee beans in my house so I had to do an emergency run to the drive through Starbucks Last min changes are awful That sucks GC @GC: Because the higher ups always like to make you rush. I get requests for reports to be presented at board meeting, that the VPs know they need weeks in advance, with just 45min-1hour notice to get it presentable...while on a tight enough deadline to get the weeks' payroll submitted. Urgh, my boss has just given me new stuff to add to massive database and it's all done in a different format. This was supposed to be handed in today... It's nearly 4pm here, that's definitely not going to happen... Why couldn't he have sent this ages ago :( Allison that's great news! I expect a provoke, a beard and a tank from you! That's what folks over in Europe call it ^"Cheetah Cub" @House Arrest, bring along something that you could use as a beard, too. Oh, sorry @CB, I think I didn't updated my google sheets... Just got a call to babysit my nephew tomorrow. Even though infants terrify me the first thing I thought was I could provoke him! ^"Cheetah Cub" With over 68,000 backers, you'd think we could achieve 25 of each task, even with just a tiny fraction of us contributing. ^"Cheetah Cub" I kep seeing that uni. Does that mean, "University?" That would be my closest guess. I know we can't get the voting ones but if like all the others Our best hope for bears or babies is groups at colleges/uni Yea the Kitten ears was at a con... Which is usually a weekend deal ^"Cheetah Cub" @DtQ, I understand. At this point, most people (myself included) don't expect to be able to achieve the 50 bears (OR 50 BABIES) photo, but I'm still holding out hope for that one. The 100 kitten ears photo came in just under the wire last time. Justin if you could find it that would be great I know you did all that I just used the tattoo as an example as it was an extreme example as most people figured we wouldn't get that one I thought about that. I'm also considering using audio of a bear instead. I wonder if you can do a text to voice version? ^"Cheetah Cub" @DtQ, I got a tattoo, made a sculpture, constructed a fighter jet cat out of a plastic model and a stuffed toy, voted, recorded a speech, mad BvB themed pumpkins, and even tried to pass off a bearded puppy as a bearded baby. Seriously, there's not a whole lot more I can contribute. We need more people to step up. We're almost there! Recruit someone! Yeah, just can't talk. That's what I'm trying to figure out lol. Didn't Tanguy say he was going to do one? Well don't forget the prewritten over if your creative juices fail you If you got a tattoo they can read a speech! I don't currently have a voice, trying to get creative for the speech I don't know ^"Cheetah Cub" @DtQ, I haven't seen anyone picking one of the pre-written scripts yet. Have you? What are we doing wrong? ^"Cheetah Cub" Anyone who hasn't posted a speech, would you please tell us what more we can do to encourage you to give it a try? If more people would spend time on this comment board they would at least know we have speeches for them Yea I am not a fan of speeches but I want that goal so I did it ^"Cheetah Cub" ... hold up ... ^"Cheetah Cub" @DtQ, yeah. I'd like to see a lot more speeches since they're easy to do. Unfortunately, too many backers are camera shy. Seriously, all you need to do is hole up a handwritten hashtag and do a video selfie rambling on for a minute or two about bears and babies. Is it the fear of speaking on camera or the process of uploading to YouTube (also with hashtag #BEARSVSBABIES) that's scaring people away? You even have prepared scripts ready to record on www.cubsubcorps.com/SpeechScripts.html CB I love that bearded baby the look on his face is priceless ^"Cheetah Cub" EK is Exploding Kittens, Elan's previous game on KickStarter. The campaign has ended, but you can buy it on Amazon. I'm not saying do it without their permission... But Exploding Kittens our benevolent creators first game What is EK? And my neighbor has pumpkins sitting outside...maybe I'll draw on them lol ^"Cheetah Cub" @Aether, Ashley's count says we already have 20 beard babies, which would leave only 5 more to go. Did you see this one? <url>"Cheetah Cub" Looks like the closest three to work on are Themed Pumpkins, Beard Babies, and Provokes. Speeches, Bear Bellies, and Tank Babies all need 15 or more apiece to achieve those tasks, so they would require a lot more entries to get there in 2 1/2 days. We currently need to average 115 new backers per hour to reach 75k so please don't forget to share with your friends and family! Crowberry that would be great I'm expecting a lot more recruits...I mean backers these coming days Bryan I think we'll get there Yea that's fair enough ^"Cheetah Cub" @DtQ, that's what my count comes to. Just waiting for the "official" unofficial count from @Aether. If I start going by my guesses, things could get out of hand and the count totals could be inaccurate. Would be ridiculous if we don't get the last sg I'll see about finding a baby! Most of those are from Alison and her recruits ^"Cheetah Cub" To get to the speech scripts from the CubSubCorps home page, click on "Speech Scripts" or you can go there directly at <url>"Cheetah Cub" @Aether, any update to the unofficial totals? I see a few more themed pumpkins since last night. If doing a speech it must be audio or video If you want we have speeches on the www.cubsubcorps.com page Make sure the #BearsVsBabies is IN your photo no Photoshop Or Facebook Yea Ok and I post to Twitter? Or Instagram? And we're closing in so try and do whatever you can! Check out the following page for our current confirmed and estimated numbers <url>#Update9 but I know I missed some this time You never know Yes, It would be really great if we could get more than 35 achievements Hopefully we'll be able to get a few more achievements in the last few days for this one We made it to like 878% funded and I'm not sure how many Twitter followers We only missed 2 achievements 100,000 Twitter followers and 100,000% funded I only wished I had access to a goat! My cousin told me she'd take a provoke picture last night but she never sent me one Ooh awesome! If anyone is at a conference or uni, please turn yourselves into bears! ;) I wish I could, but I work in an office of about 10 people on a good day, and I'm quite new to the area so I don't really know anybody! Yeah, it looked like great fun! The EK campaign was a blast when I saw they had a new game I had zero doubt I would back it! The 100 car ears was done at a convention I think <url>#BearsVsBabies, and then upload it to Twitter, Facebook or Instagram with the #BearsVsBabies! Please do so within the next 62 hours!!!!! (Worth a shot ;)) I totally missed it too! And I would really have liked to be part of that campaign as well. Those uni times, seems very far today... haha I was thinking of going into a school with carton/cardboard to recycle and ask the school to let their students make some bear masks and then taking the picture but sadly, I definitely have no time to do so in the next 63 hrs... Me too! If I was still in uni I probably would have been able to organise something with a group that I was in, but now I'm fully adulting and I only know about 10 people who live near to me ;) No I didn't really know about kickstarter much back then, so I didn't back it. Really wish I had though! How about you? Did you participate a lot in the EK campaign too? hopefully... I want to see that pic of 50 people dressed as bears/babies! Me too, I'm looking forward to that! Hopefully the new backers will see the stretch goals too and add to them if we still need it ;) Yes! I want to see the surge of new backers once the 2-days left e-mail is sent from KS :D Yeah, that's very true! Haha, it was :D *throws cake at screen* I did, it looked like such a great day yesterday! It's getting exciting!! Hey, did you notice that we are very close to unlock more goals? =D hahah not quite an option but at least today's not Monday like yesterday :P that coffee cupcake sounds delicious at this early/late moment! haha Oooh wow, that's exciting! Wow, that's very early/late depending on your perspective! I'm good thanks. Yeah, I had a coffee cupcake for breakfast and I guess I could do some adulting. I'd prefer not to, but I don't think that's really an option ;) I'm fine, thanks! Kinda sleepy but I still have to work, my campaign will be launched this week. It's 3:10 AM And you? Did you already have breakfast, coffee and lots of energy for adulting? @Aether! How are you? What time is it for you? Hi Ginger Cub!! Morning lovely cubsies! :) I appreciate that Cha! @Quack.. thank you!! I do hope things will be looking up for you real soon!! Of Monsters And Men - Slow And Steady <url># Amanda Superb pumpkins! Cha! This one goes out to you The Rolling Stones - Miss You <url>` I am not messing up the covers. Sliding in so as not to wrinkle all the sheets making sure the quilt stays nice and clean Have you ever seen a bed so neat? I'm getting intooo bed! ... sleepsleepsleeptimetogotosleepnow itisnightandineedtosleepwhileitisdark iamreallytiredtimeforsleep nowtiredtiredsleepsleepsleep I'm getting into bed! ` <url>"I wonder if their campaign in. 2017 they eluded to week have another animal theme." Yeah, I'm gonna need to use a lifeline. I wonder if their campaign in. 2017 they eluded to week have another animal theme. We had kittens and bears what could be next? Or Brewers & Barmaids, the comment-crew-inspired game! Yea Zem stay healthy +1 to what CB said... We want you around on 2030 when Elan's & Oatmeal's 25th campaign is launched: Chickens empires Well, it was a joke. I'm sleeping the same as normal, the only changes in that come from me being stupid and going to sleep too late, so I make up for it a little during the day, and the snacks I'm eating now are only because of a trip to walmart recently, and it was the first time in probably a year I've gotten some of these things, so it's not that bad, it was just a funny thought. ^"Cheetah Cub" And on that high note, it's time to take my grumpy old self upstairs and go to bed. I'll talk to you all tomorrow. Hopefully we can get five more beard babies before the 48 hour alert goes out. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, eat some protein, a piece of string cheese or something, and NO MORE DONUTS for the next three days! Go see a doctor and have your blood sugar tested. It sounds like it's way off and we don't want you headed down the path to diabetes. There, I feel better now. ... of course, I expect you to ignore everything I just said. I did when I was your age and now I'm dealing with the consequences. My bad Zem...I was just excited for any word from the BvB team Oh come on, the way you said that made me think it was an official update, like for the final countdown! You made me look! Boo loneliness Yay updates! I'm going out as little as possible, getting lazy, eating a bunch, way more sugar than normal especially, and sleeping all the time... I think I'm going into hibernation! Dang, maybe it's this campaign! I'm turning into a bear! NSFW pack I believe is still hovering around 20 additional cards? That I'm also not sure on. @Sarah - wow, no I was way off on that. Shame on me. Base game went from 80 to 112. @Sarah - I believe it went from 80 to 112. Will double-check though. I didn't see it but how many more cards were added to the nsfw booster deck? Thanks @Ashley! Good to see you again! Thanks @Ashley! Our current pace would put us at 75,500 at funding time ^"Cheetah Cub" New Official counts have been posted. We're tearing it up on beard babies, only five left. Don't let up yet though. www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html Hello everyone! Here is your evening update: 8 baby tank, 16 pumpkins, 20 beard babies, 19 provokes, 367 votes, 1 person dressed in bvb at voting, 7 pregnant belly bear, 10 rousing speech/anthems Its the last week of the campaign, and we have some pretty exciting things ahead. Keep up the good work! You're so close to the final stretch. Deep breaths. Yea I w any enough others find in case but I'm still confident we'll get there Speaking of averages, in order to reach 75k backers, we're going to have to average 100 backers an hour. Actually you averaged a little under 1 comment every 1.6 minutes, but earlier it was every 30-60 seconds. You're actually slacking! Get commenting! *cracks whip* *remembers why you don't crack whips in a small room* *ends performance review for today* ` Now after being sad I missed so much, time to go eat and miss some comments! And yeah, I know the different people thing. That's the hardest part of this campaign! :P I have at least two people. I'm hoping for 2-4 more than that though. Fortunately convincing them to decorate a pumpkin is easier than the food shares, artwork, battles, and speeches I've convinced some of them to do :P Same group I was hoping to do 5 as bears with, but we got beat to the punch for that one, and far better than we'd have done it. Wow, I go and play a game for 4 1/2 hours straight and you take it as an opportunity for 102 comments without me? I mean... good on you. Ooh, 103 now. I guess I should try to check in while playing more. ^"Cheetah Cub" Remember, the submissions need to come from different people if they are in the same category. Actually 4 with Julie's pumpkin Justin claims to have 5 which will leave us with 5 more needed How many submissions are you going to have? I'm excited about your pumpkins! Thanks Amanda I'll look into Dexit Also, we got two of our pumpkins done this morning, no photos yet. Hoping to get the rest of my group together tonight for a posting spree of pumpkins. Dixit - Odyssey apparently plays 12. We have played normal Dixit (designed for 6) with more than that on occasion. It's a little clunkier if you don't have dice or extra tokens though. Cards Against Humanity (duh). We play a lot of "team" games when we have that many - Codenames, Pictionary, things like that. I've done D&D with a group of 8 before as well. +1 beard baby +1 bvb pumkin Thans @Julie! if you are reading this :) Any other games? Both board and card are good I'll look into fluxx any version suggestion? Card vs board game? ^"Cheetah Cub" Oh yeah, stretch goals ... updated. www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html Flux By the way anyone have any good suggestions for games with 8 players that don't get boring between turns Aether we made some good progress today I refuse to believe there's no beer in heaven That's a good one CB 19 baby provokes (6 to go) unofficial ^"Cheetah Cub" Oh crap. I just missed him! ^"Cheetah Cub" @GM, here's another reason. <url>"Cheetah Cub" How about this one by Brave Combo? <url>"Cheetah Cub" A lot of my polka music is ripped from my Dad's old LP's Hm ^"Cheetah Cub" Something by Ray Budzilek, but I couldn't find anything. What would you have suggested? Nah ^"Cheetah Cub" Wow, no segue? How bout this one <url>"Cheetah Cub" @DtQ, +1 for "Too Fat Polka!" O can't believe we're having a mini-Oktoberfest in November, but I love it! CB I'm also a sucker for this one <url>"Cheetah Cub" ... wasabi. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Justin, if you want to try it, just use regular apple cider vinegar, but make sure you get genuine 100% ground horseradish, not the ridiculous watered-down "horseradish sauce." use it sparingly though because it will clean out your sinuses quicker than wasab.! Black jelly beans? Eww It is now officially too cold for beer. Time to break out the rum ^"Cheetah Cub" How about a little Frankie Yankovic? <url>"Cheetah Cub" I always spelled it Polack. Do you like poppy seed cake? Kiszka is delicious Mike as a fellow Pollock I love almost all the food you listed... No picked eggs or herring ^"Cheetah Cub" Licorice and hot pepper? "Have to have 'em!" I think I might need to buy some of these as well... <url>"Cheetah Cub" Careful, @Justin. That's how I got started on jelly babies. Once I found them on Amazon, I was like, "Have to have 'em!" I just googled licorice cigars and now I totally want a box ^"Cheetah Cub" My dad used to eat boiled eggs with vinegar and pure ground horseradish. I tried it and discovered I liked them too. I'll even eat kiszka (Polish blood sausage) but it's not my favorite. I love the licorice cigars, mostly because my dad always had at least one box aging at all times when we were kids. Open up a box, start aging a new one. I think I'm the only one in the family other than him that likes the stuff. ^"Cheetah Cub" My ethnic background is Polish American. I like pierogi's, kielbasa, golabki, avd pickled herring. ^"Cheetah Cub" I like all kinds of licorice: jelly beans, salty, allsorts, etc. I'm great too thanks @HC! Wish I could stay and chat, but it's time for bed for me! xx @CB - Scandinavians generally like salted licorice. Most of my scandi friends do, anyway. I love all types. My Mom and I used to pick through family bowls of jelly beans hunting for the black ones :] @GC - I'm great and I hope you are too xx They have a nice, clean(and shiny) snap to them too. But I'm at work until about 9:30 I could just go for a nice hoppy beer Aged licorice cigar anyone? Not sure when I bought them(I'm thinking at least a year and a half ago, since it was when the one receptionist was still here...and she's been gone for about that long), but there are two remaining(after the one I'm sucking on now, of a box of 24). ^"Cheetah Cub" I like salted licorice too. Bit hard on the dental work though. It's really hard to chew. I love the salty licorice drop candy! A lot of other Dutch sweeties are nice, though. ^Never-ever Ever. Untaste. ^"Cheetah Cub" @HC, lol. That reminds me of a quote from "My Fair Lady" Henry Higgins: "Repeat after me. 'In Hartford, Hreford and Hampshire, Harrigans Hardly ever happen" Eliza Doolittle: "In 'artford, 'ereford and 'ampshire, 'arrigans 'ardly HEVER 'appen!" ^Will never forget that flave. One candy, that's definately an acquired taste, is Dutch licorice or "drop" candy. There are sweet varieties, but the kind most familiar to Dutchies is the salty kind. And the salt tradtionally used is a bit...uhhh. It's something you have to have grown up with. ^=^ Hi @HC, how are you? :) xx @GC - Heya xx @CB - I now say 'Heych' for the last letter of my first name because that's how they say that letter here ;] ^"Cheetah Cub" Sorry. @HC. I got carried away with zed. ^"Cheetah Cub" @HZ, I actually pronounce the letter z as "zed." It just sounds right to me. @HC!!! Thank you so much to everyone who's doing things/getting others to do things! We can do this! :D @CB - I like the British spellings. They have flair :] This can be such a close call..! I'll also reach to my friends with pet hippopotamus or babies try to see if they can help. I'd like to find a fun way to do the speech recording, but am overloaded at work. Will try to record it anyway even if in a boring manner. ^"Cheetah Cub" I just ate my first ever jelly baby. I would totally choose these over gummy bears! They're much softer and have twice the flavour. (See what I did there? British spelling for flavour) Also, elan just liked my tweet (along with @Aether) . Total fanboy/fangirl moment @Cheetah - Thanks! ^=^ @cb yeah, I'm keeping an eye on it, but we're currently pacing to hit 75,236. I don't like those odds. That's a close call ^"Cheetah Cub" @PC, here you go. (Holds bag of jelly babies up to the screen. ^"Cheetah Cub" Yeah, I don't want to count on reaching 75,000 backers and wind up missing out on SG3 if wr don't quite make it. Still think a plate with a slice of pie or cake, soon to be foisted on a sleeping or unaware baby, is a prime provoke. A hungry baby can quite an adversary. About the beards, though - I think they intend that they be applied, rather than just drawn on , so paper, fuzz or soap suds might do the trick. @Cheetah - I'd love a Jelly Baby , but am stuck with some nervous celery. ;) Since it's looking like it will be really close on the 75k goal, I'd rather not count on it so I'm trying to push for three other unlocks to be safe ^"Cheetah Cub" Somebody did a BvB version of that Hitler scene. It's hilarious! I don't know if it will count as a speech (the hashtag is missing in the captions) but it's too good not to watch. <url>"Cheetah Cub" As we stand now, we need a minimum of 9 submissions to achieve stretch goal 3, but a more realistic estimate is that we'll need at least 25. ^"Cheetah Cub" I usually start the day with 8-10oz of dark roast or a can of Double-Shot light. On some mornings, I opt for a Monster Ultra instead. After that, I switch to diet soda. ^"Cheetah Cub" Don't feel bad, @Justin. The KickStarter comment monster has bitten each of us at one time or another. Frankly, I think it's a bug that they never bothered getting around to fixing. Don't know the volume of the coffee I have in the morning, but it's a large from Tim Horton's. Just the one coffee, Mon-Fri. And rarely(if ever) any on the weekends. @cb seriously! Lol. It froze after I clicked post then the app locked up. When I reopened it, there were 4 identical posts. What an odd bug. ^"Cheetah Cub" @JJ, lol. Seems like that 52oz of coffee is having an effect on your posts. ;-) ^"Cheetah Cub" We just got 1 more tank baby and 1 more belly bear, so we are inching closer. Stretch goal counts have been updated accordingly at www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html Wow... Did that just post 4 times? My morning coffee is a 52oz mug. I'm a bit of a coffee fiend My morning coffee is a 52oz mug. I'm a bit of a coffee fiend My morning coffee is a 52oz mug. I'm a bit of a coffee fiend My morning coffee is a 52oz mug. I'm a bit of a coffee fiend ^"Cheetah Cub" @!C, Jelly babies are more like baby shaped gummy bears. They're common in the UK. (Again holds bag up to the screen in a gesture of sharing.) Cha, didn't you hear of my Breakfast of Champions yesterday? 2 donuts and a good amount of Chocolate Marshmallow Mateys (cocoa puffs with Lucky Charms marshmallows), and later on, coffee! I can take it! Haha...noooo coffee, salty buttery popcorn AND sugary jelly baby beans for @Zem. He'll be running on an even higher high ^"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, care for a jelly baby? (Holds a bag of jellied confections up at the screen) Pop-... No! I've already been subliminally messaged into making coffee! I won't have you forcing me into popcorn at the same time, it'd be hard to eat while playing Skyrim anyways. @Quack...awesome for doing the speech!! Thank you!! :) was that popcorn popping in the background? ;) *... Mmmmm... darn you, Dave, my other weakness, coffee! I'll be back in yet a few more minutes, this time with coffee.;; ^"Cheetah Cub" Hey, my jelly babies came! A little late for the sharing achievement, but now I can finally put them into a small white paper sack and put on my abnormally long scarf to ask perfect strangers whether they'd care for one! Woo Who! I love me some coffee! And I'm going to take a nap now. Hey! I see you trying to take advantage of me being gone again! I'll be back on the hour, so you better watch yourself! No spam! I can't sleep with all that noise and racket! ` Because naps are for children, college students, and old people. And I'm proud to be at least one of those. OK folks phone has to charge for a bit talk to you all later ^"Cheetah Cub" I could have used a pot of that last Wednesday. I stayed up until 3AM and then had to get up again at 8AM to go to work. I was still sleeping it off over the weekend. Oh to be young again and back in my fifties ... Though I am notably absent in the mornings, and afternoons on weekends... ` Aether, mattresses sleep the same. They sleep with half their brain at a time. So next time you're sleeping, you'll never be able to get the image your mattress being half-conscious out of your mind. MUHUAHAHAHAHAHA!!! Recently I've been making entire pots of some really, really good Italian espresso I found; I can't quite remember, but I don't think I've slept since I opened that coffee. Last thursday.﻿ Yeah, you may have a point there, CB. sleeps* Maybe Zem is half dolphin and he sleep with one hemisphere of his brain at a time... Zem the Mattress Dolphin-blood/ Zem the Mattress of House Dolphin bear, first of his name ^"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, you had me fooled. I see you here all the time and have started to wonder if you ever sleep. I'd miss you if you weren't here. Actually, I haven't talked to myself on here in some time. Occasionally I dominate the conversation, but not quite as often anymore. I guess it's just old age or something, I'm kinda leaning away from the comments. Or at least don't check in here quite as habitually as with EK. ^"Cheetah Cub" I play the iPhone version. I think I would like the app for tubes I was stuck by myself to play with strangers ^"Cheetah Cub" The goal count has been updated now on <url>"Cheetah Cub" Well worth the money. Sorry to disagree with @Tanguy, but the tension builds a lot faster with the app, especially with random opponents. ^"Cheetah Cub" Actually, I like the EK app better than the card game. I think it is. But the extensions are better so 4.99 total (?). Real game is still on top though Carry conversations Well Zem two reasons for that 1) We're in crunch mode 2) You Carey conversations by yourself anyway Is it worth $1.99? Dave. Dave, I know you've always looked up to me, the King of Spam, but... Hakuna your Tatas! ;) Man, I leave for one hour and the amount of comments today doubles! I swear every time that you guys wait until I leave to do this stuff! Fair enough The EK app is not as fun as the real game, but it's good This campaign has made me think of downloading the EK app once I got confirmation about my new job I was gonna pull the trigger Welcome aboard Mate @Tanguy! @Fernando that's great! looking forward for your speech! It's all good ^"Cheetah Cub" I play the EK app, but right now I'm so busy with BvB, I haven't played for a while. ^"Cheetah Cub" @DtQ, sorry about the link. It's actually a subdomain of www.kittencorps.com and the URL comes out funky if you just copy it from the current page. If you get redirected to the home page, just click on the appropriate link on the left side of the page. I do play EK IRL and on iPad/iPhone a lot Let us know which one you pick si you can mark it as used There are speeches for you to read here <url>"Cheetah Cub" Thanks, @Tanguy Barbier, and welcome aboard. Perfect Tanguy I initially missed this stretch goal, I thought it was a request from the crew ;) I'll try to find a good duty ! Mate is already an honour. Regarding the speech, I'll try to record it tomorrow. Welcome aboard Tanguy! ^"Cheetah Cub" @Tanguy, I'll add you as a Mate, for right now. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Tanguy, yes, it needs to be before 9PM EST on Thursday. You don't need to have a cubsubcorps name. Any backer can contribute to the Stretch Goals. Oooh @CB I think we have an aspiring new crew member!! =D If you need a speech we have a few written Yes it has to be before campaign end. You can change your name if you want to. Oh ! I missed the goal for the speech !! I'll try to do it tomorrow ! You're welcome ! (From myself and my amazing wife). I will think of a speech. Does it have to be before the KS end ? Should I change my name to include a name for your club ? One I know she's busy but I'm sure she'd read a prewritten over Did Cub Cake do a speech? Stayed as Regards what I guessed but for dinner reason when I was on that page the URL said as the home page ^"Cheetah Cub" @DtQ, when referring to the scripts page, the direct link is <url>"Cheetah Cub" Yay, @Tanguy, you did it! (with your wife's help, of course.) Thanks @Tanguy!! Please express our gratitude to your wife and congratulations for the new baby =D (Ladies****** ew the "ys") ^"Cheetah Cub" I'm always adding stuff to the Corps website. I recommend browsing occasionally. If you have content you'd like to add, post it in these comments and I'll try to get it put on the site. <url>"Cheetah Cub" If anyone has already chosen one of those scripts to record, let us know that here so we don't have duplicated efforts. ^"Cheetah Cub" ... and then post the current status of speech scripts on the Speech Scripts page. ^"Cheetah Cub" We'll need to keep track of who's doing which speech here. I suppose I can manually track which ones have been done and which ones are still available. ^"Cheetah Cub" @DtQ, we already did that last week. <url>"Cheetah Cub" Everyone who hasn't submitted a speech, please record one and post it. It doesn't have to be Shakespeare. (That one has already been written ... though not yet recorded.) I have 5 pumpkins I can carve. I was planning to do them with my wife and kids but I don't see the kids until Wednesday. Adding mine to the total we'd need 16 more Work on the speech! Seems you don't have to worry about the octopus Amanda send quite talented at that kind of thing I'm working on one. Will be easier to do if I don't have to do the cthuluducken. Turns out that buying octopus in this area is quite difficult. I'm sure a writer could write you one if you're willing to perform! Justin, CB, Cha, aether, Dr. P., And so on? That's a shame @CB, at least you got a really cute picture out of it ;) Wish there was more that I could contribute, but I don't know any babies, and I don't know 50 people... Have all the regulars done speeches? No problem...I didn't write it but he said he didn't think he'd have time to record... So even though speeches aren't my thing I tried to step up for the team! They officially accepted the cthuluducken? ^"Cheetah Cub" Looks like they rejected my fur-baby. Sorry guys. I tried. ^"Cheetah Cub" Wow, @DtQ, that's a Serious speech! Thanks for doing it. I still feel with the end of campaign sure will hit 75 so that will put us to 33 so we need provokes and beards people! Oh sorry I was looking on the BvB page and the campaign tab CB I don't see any updates? Sleeping is probably safer to ensure acceptance at this point W00t We need more baby beards and provokes... I don't think they have to be asleep for it, just as long as iot looks like your about to provoke.... That was interesting to explain ^"Cheetah Cub" New Official totals are up. We got the Cthulu-Ducken! www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html My cousin said she can send me a provoke picture tonight <url>"Cheetah Cub" +1 @Aether. That's why I've been posting encouraging thins in between submitting my own photos. We really slowed down over the weekend, but we still have four days left. ^"Cheetah Cub" @DtQ, bear suits are more expensive than cat ears. I still hope someone can pull it off though. @Aether - I wonder if a lot of people just got burned out by the addition of extra hoops (Post speeches! ... just kidding you have to video them, thanks for all the speeches you already worked on!). I liked the Cthuluducken that was made - but not getting official updates on whether things count make it hard to say whether we need more people to step up or not. Either way, I'm working on my pumpkin now! even though ashley shows up for an official update, there hadn't been many posts since the last one so we really need to push 'em more. Provoke babies! Beard 'em up! make punpkins!! Those are the closest! Cook a C-Ducken! Bonus: 50 people dressed as bears! With all of those we will have 36 goals completed I still think we'll get the 75k backers we still have the end of the campaign surge coming up I can't believe we don't have 50 people dressed as bears. If we got 100 with cat ears for EK we can get 50 dressed as bears for this! @DtQ sorry to read about the delay on your job... but ALWAYS look at the bright side: you won't be adulting in the last days of this campaign :P @Dave - That'd be great! Hopefully! Someone said him, his wife and maybe his kids were going to do pumpkins @Justin - I know. I have pumpkins though, my walmart had the mini ones 5/$1, so I bought five. Me, my two guys, hopefully two of my friends. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, I think part of it is the way KickStarter handles comments. Occasionally one of mine doesn't post. Seriously crossing my fingers for an official update soon! Especially as we're getting down to the wire and I hate last minute scrambles! Plus expansions are unlikely since they haven't even finished the original rules yet Chiky possibly but those things can delay shipment plus drive up costs if SGs worked as SGs in other campaigns, i thing we would be having like 3 expansions, minis for the babies, a bear mini first player token, t-shirts for eveyone... hahah Zem that is strange Zem thanks that helped a little but I'm still feeling more like this <url>"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, you probably needed to refresh the page. If that doesn't bwork, clear your browser history and try again. Some devices are really stubborn about holding on to old data instead of refreshing the page from the Internet, especially on older phones lke yours. "He said at the beginning of the conversation a day or two at the end of the conversation he said by the end of the week" ... Okay, even I'm having a bit of trouble with this one! And that's saying quite a bit! I frequently have to manually refresh the page when using my phone. Then the see more comments button pops up and I have to push it a bunch of time since it is way behind Dave, maybe this can help! <url>"see more comments" thing! ^"Cheetah Cub" Hang in there, @DtQ. I know it's frustrating when you're ready and they're not. I spent most of last year in that situation. I persevered though and something eventually came through. It took a lot of patience. That sucks @Dave, sorry to hear that. Did they say if/when they'd get back to you? Love the baby tank by the way Good luck finding the ingredients Justin On the plus side enjoy this baby tank <url>"Cheetah Cub" If you can't find octopus, can you substitute squid? Do they have octopuss in a jar? Like pickled octopuss ... uhm that does not sound very delicious though... I've been trying to do the cthuluducken but it turns out octopus is not easy to find around here. The search continues. Ahh how delightful. Luckily my boss had the dentist today during our normal meeting time, so it's been pushed back to tomorrow :) Good Day to you @Ginger Cub :) On my way to a work meeting so adulting will abound Morning Cha!, how are you today? @Quack...crossing all fingers and toes for you! Good Morning CubSubbians :) Any time @CB :) Yeah, me too, helps me through my work day ^"Cheetah Cub" Thanks, @GC. That's why I like hanging out here. :-) Cheerleading and happiness and all that jazz is never annoying :) ^"Cheetah Cub" I hope all of my cheerleading isn't annoying anyone. ^"Cheetah Cub" Life's good for me. Looking forward to another super day! How's life? Morning GC! Morning @CB and @BaKhan :) Morning me cub sub hearties! ^"Cheetah Cub" Morning cubbies. Any new submissions overnight? It's getting close and we still need a lot of stuff. Did anyone cook a Cthulu-Ducken yet? I remember @LZ said he was going to make one, but I haven't seen it yet. Any more babies, pumpkins, or speeches? Looks like 75,000 backers is a bit iffy too. Thanks Zem Geist, why didn't you just say so? I thought it seemed like an odd night. One of the ones that makes me actually question my alarm when it turns out to be right... again. ` Good luck, Dave! Can't wait to hear about it later! Thanks GC ... Eats cake off screen I've got my fingers crossed for you, and I'm sure the others do too :) We're all rooting for you I NEED this job...funds in my house are super low Aww, have some cake to calm you down *throws cake at screen* Good luck! :) I should be getting a job offer today A little stressed but hanging in there I'm pretty good thank you, how are you? How are you GC? Wahoo I'm here :) I was just eating my lunch OK I'll go shower hopefully someone will be here when I get back Guess not Anyone in this pond? Morning folks Excellent ;) @Ginger Cub: you're dreaming. Go back to sleep Morning all! Please someone tell me that I am dreaming and it isn't really Monday already... @Tom - counts are up at <url>` I am not messing up the covers.

New unofficial totals are on <url>"Cheetah Cub" I still don't expect to see her before tomorrow. I know I meant from Ashley ^"Cheetah Cub" I can't do official updates unless I get a new count from Ashley. I don't expect to see that until early tomorrow afternoon. *official count updates? Still no oriel count updates? I think colorful cats are female and most blandly colored cats are male, but some females are also just gray or yellow sometimes. Dogs, I tend not to guess a gender, but I do tend to assume most things I don't know of are male just because I'm male, so my brain somehow thinks everything else must be as well. Unless dude looks like a lady. It's all good, I think I assume all cats and dogs to be girls since my whole family always had girls ^"Cheetah Cub" Did you know that people tend to assume that all puppies are male and all kittens are female? I guess I fell into the trap of assuming that all bearded babies are male. Sorry about that. ^"Cheetah Cub" She's still cute, though. Thanks that's a girl though it is hard to tell in a bath. I always put Update#9 in homage to EK Haha, isn't it technically Update 7 or something? I also love your pumpkins ^"Cheetah Cub" @DtQ, Awww he's really cute. CB I love your bearded pic...I submitted one as well! <url>"Cheetah Cub" Fwiw, my beard fur-baby is now posted. I hope it's accepted, but he's just too cute not to post. He didn't complain (much) when I took the picture. I might just need to send Christmas cards this year. <url>"I'm wasted on cross-country! We Dwarves are natural sprinters, very dangerous over short distances." Dwarves are my spirit animal. I'm just a 6'3" dwarf. ;) Zem, your 30 year benchmark reminds me of a reference to 'Logan's Run' and the "Renewal Day". I always pick you as a high-spirited, sugar-fueled "Runner" ;) Well, having a heart attack may be worth it if you get there via donuts and chocolate marshmallow mateys. Ooh, next time I should use CHOCOLATE milk for the cereal! ... I won't even make it to 28. ;) ^"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, using your logic, I've already lived two "lifetimes" so WTF? ^"Cheetah Cub" My traditional "breakfast of champions" is a Snickers bar and a Mountain Dew. Haha, CB. I'll have to try to shop one... I mean take the picture again later with the hashtag in there. This has to be the least healthy breakfast ever. Well... I SAY breakfast, but it's 1:45 pm, so... first lunch? Anyways, 2 donuts and a bowl of cereal that's essentially cocoa puffs with the marshmallows from Lucky Charms. Who wants to live past 30 anyways? ^"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, lol, but no hashtag. <url>` sorry, forgot to paste the link! How about a baby (stuffed) bear in lederhosen to make up for it? ^"Cheetah Cub" With all of the German posts here, I'd have expected to see a baby (or bear) wearing lederhosen. @CB not that I've seen. I'm pretty anxious about it too. ^"Cheetah Cub" Did I miss any Official/unofficial count updates? I didn't see any. ^"Cheetah Cub" Also, congrats to @Zem for winning the coveted PGSFFBofESTOK Award. www.cubsubcorps.com/FAQ.html ^"Cheetah Cub" Hi everybody.

Someday I hope to. That video with Nina Hagen was so powerful. Nena - Vollmond <url># :) Aww yes growing up bi-lingual would have been the best so I understand. Glad you're learning now. Have you been to Germany? And here's a Nina :) Thomas D. & Nina Hagen - Solo <url># @Cha I am still learning. My grandfather emigrated with his family when he was a teenager. He was teased for not knowing English when he went to school so he didn't speak it in front of his children. I feel like a lot was lost because of that so I started to learn it after he passed. I love this playlist! I'd completely forgotten about Nena Indeed Justin :) How do you know German? Joachim Witt and Peter Heppner - Die Flut (The Flood) with lyrics in English Translation <url>önemeyer - Männer <url># ;) Falco - Out Of The Dark <url># He was Austrian (which I don't hold against him ;) and pretty genius The 80s and Neue Deutsche Welle is a fun music trove :) Geier Sturzflug - Bruttosozialprodukt (yep we love long words) <url># @cha yes! Totally just added that to my playlists! @zem roughly translated it says: "nobody can tell you the answers to all of your questions, you must only understand: we reap what we sow" Here's 325 German songs :) <url># Mmmmmm love that pong video Ha @Justin...very cool find!!

I say I'm going to sleep, but then go to the bathroom, take out my contacts, brush my teeth... and then it's been even up to half an hour sometimes, so I decide alot must have come up in the comments in that time, so I check to make sure. and once in awhile when I do that, I get caught up even further in a slurry of onslaughts of comments I missed. Here's the actual video which is very cool <url># Haha, I do love that word! CB made it up, right? Dang, he does everything around here! ;) ...and freaky with the disembodied hands I just wanted to use slurking ;) That's very very cool!

How about this Ren & Stumpy - Royal Canadian Kilted Yaksmen <url>` No! I'd better stop or all next week I'll have Irish music in my head!

I'm looking forward to seeing Cappuccino with the beard :) Has anyone seen @Aether? Hope he's ok! Thank you much @Tanguy and your lovely supportive beautifully pregnant wife!! :) I have to start with now I'll check back in in about 2 hours Fine ignore me again :-( Mike maybe a garden center or home depot would have a pumpkin? Tanguy make sure to send over our sincerest gratitude for both attempts at the bear belly! I'm glad you at least for the beard even if it doesn't count ^"Cheetah Cub" I did get a doggie beard at Michael's though. As expected, Cappuccino hates it. ^"Cheetah Cub" Walmart was also out of Cthulu, so no luck there. Good news ! Got my wife on the phone and I'll get to draw on her belly to get this Bear to count ! I'll have to keep up to her drawing though ;) I'll do it early this week. Ok, it's time for my weekend. If I don't get back on, everycub have a lovely day/weekend/etc. I think they still sell them here in Philly. Pumpins ;) There's always Sushi to tie me over :) ^"Cheetah Cub" Hi everyone. Back for a while from shopping. They didn't have any pumpins left at Walmart, not even the little pie ones. Used to be you cold get them all the way through New Years! The soup will take like 4hrs at least but it is in the crock pot :) Zoot Woman - 'Lonely By Your Side' [<url>"Cheetah Cub" I'm a bit disappointed we didn't get the Cthulu-Ducken. I was sure that one would have been approved. Is Ashley around with accurate counts? I am also working on doing the pumpkins this weekend. my wife and I can submit separately, but what I'm wondering is this: my kids each want to do one too, but they limit submissions per account. how do you think they will count them if I submit my kids and their pumpkins separately? or should I have them each get a twitter account to submit? Has anyone talked to @LZ about it to confirm? I am planning to work on the Cthulhu Ducken this afternoon. I'm still planning on it. 3 will be better than one right? Yeah it was missing crab legs and bacon. I know LZ will not spare on the bacon!! Provoke Babies, Beard Babies and BvB themed pumpkins are all similarly close with about 8 to 11 missing. We still need quite a number of rousing speeches with emphasis on the speech part. Maybe re-visit to see if whoever posted one has made a recording/video yet or ask for permission to do one for them. Those are our 4-5 best ones to unlock the awesome box, the one giving box manufacturers loose hairs and wild initial exclamation of nopes I thought for sure we'd get the 1,000 voters i'm bummed we only got 366 I am going to do a baby beard and perhaps a tank if I can work the logistics on it. The Cducken didn't look like all the parts were authentic to me but LZ said he's on it. There's one Cducken dish posted in a Twitter and Justin as well as LZ said they were going to do it so hopefully we'll have that one in the bag or oven ;) I think it's pretty safe to go by recent number updates and to work on the ones that were most close to being accomplished. @Quack... I was doing really good after a backing spree last month. I hadn't browsed looked at considered any other campaigns. And then a reminder email popped up. Had totally forgotten about those pesky lil delicious remind you to have to back last minute. @Paul rest up for the last hurrah we only have 5 days left(I'm sure you guys have something fun planned) Yay!! Thank you sick Paul hopefully feeling much better soon Paul!! :) yum delicious delicious coffee @Anja check the count again ¬_¬ @dave thanks, and check with Ashley about what counts. I'm just trying to keep up with the visuals. Thanks @Justin :) You guys should see what I'm coughing up. I'm figuratively a rainbow ralphing cat. I actually meant to back Dracula's Feast and was going to do it last night but apparently ran out of time :( No shame I wish I could back more! Unlocked achievements match now. thanks @Paul! hope you have a speedy recovery! Thanks @Quack *hangs head in unrestrained backing shame* Uhm spewing not speeing so that could both work ;) @Paul also since Elan seems to have left will Cub-Cake's kitten provoke count <url># (Of course you should read "leave the BEAR until she gives birth". Baby'll stay inside belly until birth if I understood the process correctly :') ) <url>"baby dressed as a bear" it's even in their gallery ^"Cheetah Cub" I'm just dying to use a non-pomeranian dog for something! ^"Cheetah Cub" Also, can I use a puppy for a beard baby? We could leave the baby until she gives birth. But not sure my wife will like the idea. I'll let you know if she's ok to go for another drawing. However, I did love the surprise picture... Childish I am she says. Tssssss and did Cub-Cake's baby kitten provoke picture count? @Elan if you're still here do we at least have a count of how many we need of everything? Yep I'll try to convince her that's worth it :) CB he already said the baby didn't like the erasing process so perhaps minimizing the drawing on the belly is best. Or draw in something that will come off easier That's the spirit Tanguy! ^"Cheetah Cub" @Tanguy, you could just draw the bear AND the hashtag right on the belly, if that's easier for her. I'll draw 2 bears on one big belly ! Thanks for the answer :) NOPE! back to yup it up :D I'll try to make a new one as I get back home early next week ! :D As we figured... If she does it again(and we hope she does) you owe her since extra pampering! @Elan as you stop by, my wife's bear belly and the post-it on two different pics... do you accept it ? :)) Thanks Elan! @elan I appreciate it. thanks for all you do! wow, that was an odd coincidence! I type up a comment about updating the achievements and post it and there's our @creator already addressing the issue! nice to know you guys are on the ball! thanks I've noticed that that there is a discrepancy between the unlocked achievements on the campaign page here (26) and the ones on <url># so.... fingers crossed ! Baby was not happy with bear erasing said my wife. Looks like future human being wants his house to remain clean. So she did not want to redraw a bear. I'll see when I get back home to get a new one with everything on the same picture. Was a good surprise though, I just told her about those amazing stretch goals and she sent me the pic (she's not at all a kickstarter-girl). I'm adulting (at work). I just had an awesome lunch. Good Day CubSubbians :) I've been adulting (read cleaning) all morning. Maybe I should start a 'Cha! Said the Cub' midnight music comment cave show :) maybe I'll even answer questions... :) ^"Cheetah Cub" They re-posted the tummy with the handwritten hashtag. Unfortunately, the bear is missing. I know CB! It's so frustrating especially something as awesome as that belly bear ^"Cheetah Cub" That was such a magnificent tummy bear. I hate it when something that good is submitted without the handwritten hashtag. Please redo the bear and take a photo with a handwritten hashtag. We all appreciate your effort and if it were up to us it would be accepted. They're pretty strict about that though to keep people from just Google searching for images that fit. I have escaped the DMV! BTW congrats on the baby! Best bet is to redo it I don't know if that will count Awesome picture... But you need to retake it with #BearsVsBabies written on something in the photo(no Photoshop) I'm away from home and she forgot the hashtag... Drawing removed already, hopefully it'll work. I could ask her to send a picture of the hashtag on a note with same clothes Here is my help to the sretch goal run ! Well, my wife's help. <url>"Cheetah Cub" @Samuel, evidently, their web designer is sick with the flu. We'll keep the unofficial page on www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html as up to date as we can. ^"Cheetah Cub" ... zzz ... zzz ... zzz ... znorp! ... (_^_)... (0^_)... (0^0) ... ... ... Good morning cubbies. @Elan It would be really nice if we could get the achievements updated on the campaign page Anyone here? Awesome pic We clearly need a baby sleeping next to a kitten that's about to explode... I already did it so I can't do another... People must still have pumpkins Whoops! nevermind - from teh Kitten corps account! <url>"i need you to take a pic of you about to provoke your baby with the hashtag." and sent her some examples. She responds "On it. i'll find a gun" ohhhh erin.... It was at 3:40 in the morning so i think her screaming daughter just woke her up. morning! Guh. Mornin' all. heh yeah, they will cool down, the baseball bat provoke idea was a bad idea, nothing happened tho, just the idea was like stay away from the baby for a bit If anyone with a baby is out there, please put a beard on them, put them in a tank, and "provoke" them while they sleep!

My shoulder is sore, but not from the tattoo. It's my rotator cuff. I'm shivering. My cat is curled up and purring against me and I'm shivering. And my hip is sore. ^"Cheetah Cub" Ah, crap! I'm talking to myself again. Awwwhhhh, definitely a baby boy!!!! ^"Cheetah Cub" He definitely ACTS like a toddler! ^"Cheetah Cub" My puppy is four months old. In dog months that would be 28 months, or just over 2 years, so is he a baby, or a toddler? ^"Cheetah Cub" I was just thinking ... if provoking a kitten gets accepted as provoking a baby, I could put a Santa beard on my puppy and it should count as a beard baby. ... hmmm ... and I even know where to go to buy the Santa beard. ... ^"Cheetah Cub" @LZ, how about provoking a baby with your Cthulu-Ducken. Then it would count in the provoke category. ^"Cheetah Cub" I think we should try to overproduce on all goals until they're confirmed. ^"Cheetah Cub" @LZ, Go ahead and do the Cthulu-Ducken just in case. Damn! I was going to do the Cthuluducken! ^"Cheetah Cub" I put the Cthulu-Ducken in the unofficial count, which would mean we need three more accomplishments. Air horn is cute! My feet are freezing... but my cat is in snuggle mode and I don't want to move. @cb- yeah-- not sure if it will be accepted, but doesn't hurt to try! It is a real baby after... just not human... ^"Cheetah Cub" Is @Aether here to do another unofficial count? ^"Cheetah Cub" Missed the air horn. Looked more like bug spray. At least it's not just another finger. :-) ^"Cheetah Cub" <url>"Cheetah Cub" The challenge says, "real baby," so I wouldn't be surprised if it got rejected. WE NEED MORE BABIES!!!!!!!!!! (Never expected to be begging for baby pictures on the Internet.) ^"Cheetah Cub" @Creeper, it's cute, but it's a kitten. I think that would be more in the Bears camp than the Babies camp. ^"Cheetah Cub" If that Cthulu-Ducken counts, we only need 3 more achievements. ^"Cheetah Cub" Hey! I just saw a Cthulu-Ducken! ^"Cheetah Cub" I don't think Ashley is available this late on a Friday (which is also a holiday) for an update. You know what would be the best right now? An official update on our stretch goal counts.... You deserve it YES HIGH FIVE!!! Awesome CC <url>"Cheetah Cub" 30? creaky? I'm over 60. I've got your creak right here! One should consume at least 1tsp of Turmeric or Curcumin daily to prevent any and all joint issues. That's when your body starts to creak. Living past 30 is not all its cracked up to be Donuts, the most unhealthy cereal possible, 2 types of candy bags, chocolate pudding, corn dogs, corn chips, and peanuts. I'm happy with my life decisions! Who needs to live past 30 anyways? I mean, it's not like I got a ton of pop or anything! Yeah, it got rather tense. I used up all my cards, but there was nothing I could do in the end! Anyway, I must bed now as it is 2am! Enjoy your party :) Night! oooh! It's really fun when the last card defines the champion!! We did! I know, it just goes on and on! I came second on the first game (I imploded on the very last card!), and I exploded pretty early on in the second game! I think I need more practice ;) Hahaha sounds like you had fun! You can really get immersed in Youtube for eons. Did you win on EK? Yeah, we had friends over to play exploding kittens and then we ended up watching YouTube videos for ages. I'm shattered now, I need my bed! Ooh that sounds fun, I hope you enjoy the party :) Wow! It's late over there! I'm going to a party in one hour, so the night is early for me on this side of the planet Haha that's a good idea @Aether. Urgh, I should go to bed, it's 1:30am here CB gave me an idea... we need a copycat in the crew... anyone out there wishing to join the crew and lurking on the comments? It is so slow at work ^"Cheetah Cub" Why thank you @Aether! Why thank you @Aether! Welcome Mate of Yerba!!! And thanks for updating the cubsubcorps page @CB!! Today's new content is awesome!! Good to know CB! Thanks! ^"Cheetah Cub" @DtQ, yes. Welcome to the corps Justin Made me think of it. I feel so honored! Yay! By the way are out Kitten Corps emails still active? This campaign base me think of it? ^"Cheetah Cub" OK, Justin Jackson is now Mate of Yerba. Welcome aboard the CubSub. www.cubsubcorps.com ^"Cheetah Cub" No worries. We can leave that unassigned for now. @CB excellent question. one I am not sure I am competent to answer. The Nappening was a hit with audiences! Usually sequels don't do so well. ^"Cheetah Cub" What do you want your cub name to be? @cb I'm definitely not opposed ^"Cheetah Cub" @Justin, does that mean you want to sign on as the Mate of Yerba? Is it weird that I read "Mate of Darkness" as "Yerba Mate of darkness" and now I really want some? Similar awards LZ, just by a different name Haha, that is hilarious! :D Ahh that's worked, thank you @CB! :) ^"Cheetah Cub" @GC, try clearing your history (or cache) and the current page should show up. ^"Cheetah Cub" Thanks !C. I added Aether to the list of recipients. The difference between his comment and @GC's is hilarious. Time for Nap 2: The Nappening. Later on, I'll have the finale of the Nap Trilogy, Nap 3: Yawn of the Dead. That'll just be sleep, though. LZ you know how it works you leave for any period of time and the craziest shit evolves from our wonderfully trusted minds! Oh, there are different awards now? I guess I shouldn't be surprised. I'm back! I slightly exploded twice near the start of the game... Like the new bits on the site @CB. My phone is being very strange. My things aren't showing as updated on the site on my phone, but yours are. I think my phone needs a nap, as do I! At some point I'll read them, when I next dig out my laptop @--C.. Thank you for adding the ball of "Ok" award to the CubSubCorps website!! I threaded together the first one to @Aether for 6k comments :) we could come up with fuzzy furry threads retroactively for other k achievements if we can figure out who those were and they can name their 'k' threads adjectively :) Haha, good, CB. That question was burning in the minds of every backer! ^"Cheetah Cub" Any help I can get listing previous recipients of "the Award" and their accomplishments would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. ^"Cheetah Cub" Sorry I fat-fingered the URL, but it should still work. If not, go to <url>"Cheetah Cub" The PGSFFBofESTOK Award has been added to the FAQ at http;//www.cubsubcorps.com/FAQ.html Hahaha! Sorry I didn't see it until now, I was making coffee, but that bio is amazing, CB! CB, to what, "The only one who does any real work around here!" ;) I forced some people to play it with me as soon as I got it, James. And they were all glad I did! Except for the first one to say "Whose turn is it?", of course. ;) ^"Cheetah Cub" While I'm at it, I updated my own bio on www.cubsubcorps.com I still haven't gotten to use my Imploding Kittens expansion. I approve of your choice in games, GC. Right, see you all in a bit, off to play exploding kittens :) Thanks @CB!! :) ... maybe... ;) ^"Cheetah Cub" @GC's updated bio is now posted at www.cubsubcorps.com Click on her name to see the bio. Haha, is that what your minions do, GC? They steal the souls of your victims? You know it's good coffee when they need to use 7 languages on the back! Italian, German, Greek, French, English, Russian, and Arabic, several of whom know their coffee. ;) Haha that would be awesome @Zem! ;) Well technically gingers steal the souls of those around them because they don't have their own :D Work time Bad news: I ran out of my Guatemalan coffee, which was really good. Good news: I get to open a type of Italian espresso that's apparently super good! Is... is it because your minions are all ginger bears, and gingers have no souls? Haha, sorry, someone had to make the joke! Hahahaha, Ginger Cub must be a new DC tv show coming out, because that sounds EXACTLY like the DC show intros where they just give a short exposition! Haha I read that after I'd written that @CB, great minds think alike! My name is Steff, I'm ginger, and I like bear cubs (hence the name). I kinda jumped on board Crawfish McThundersquish when I saw how much fun the CubSub Corps were having, so I saw myself as a bit of a stowaway. This was until I nabbed the 6,666th comment, which allowed me to be promoted to the Mate of Darkness. All ginger bears are my minions, and they help me to conduct my dark deeds, mwahahaha! ^"Cheetah Cub" Understood, @GC. I hope you'll leave the stowaway part in for historical reference and add to it explaining how you were promoted to Mate of Darkness. It has a nice story line. CB I would have made a similar joke if the roles were reversed ^"Cheetah Cub" Let that be a lesson to any other stowaways who might be aboard. If we catch you, you're likely to be put to work as part of the crew. Aaaarrrrrrgh! Thanks @CB! Not refreshing on my phone for some reason so I will look at it later :) I'll probably have to update my bio thingy as I'm no longer a stowaway. I'll get thinking! ^"Cheetah Cub" Jk, @DtQ. I couldn't help myself. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, @GC's former title was "Stowaway." They don't get to have a secondary title. Once you're a Mate of any sort, you can no longer be a Stowaway. Which makes Stowaway available for anyone who's not yet part of the crew to claim. Midshipman is also available, if anyone wants to claim it. ^"Cheetah Cub" Done. @Ginger Cub is now Mate of Darkness. <url>"I seem to be having trmendous difficulty with my lifestyle." or just plain use of the word... well, I don't think I can really say it here, but I guess we're all grown-ups. *whispers* Belgium! *darts eyes around* Haha thanks @Aether! My phone is being so slow, comments are coming up so delayed! Mwahahaha :D I, being awarded by the 6000th comment, hereby pass to you the "pink growly soft fuzzy furry ball of enlightment symbolizing the 'Ok!!' Award" to you. You may add any more adjectives/properties/caracteristics to it when you pass it to the winner of the 7000th comment Nah, I watch a video with lunch, and after one ended, I checked something really quick in another video, but those crucial seconds cost me the title. Well, GC is now the Mate of Darkness. Lol, wow, what a comment to win that! It was pure luck for me, didn't see @Dr.P's comment on my phone! ^"Cheetah Cub" "Argh stupid phone @Dave" ... Isn't that the ultimate insult that started that war in Hitchhiker's Guide? Were you checking the freshness of your sandwich meat? Hooray! Congrat's GC! you've got a truly evil award 6666 And thanks for the advice CB! That is way much easier to find a comment Dang, if only I hadn't checked that one thing that took me like 20 seconds, it could have been me by pure luck! lol @Zem Comment 6,666: Steff 'Ginger Cub' 1 minute ago Argh stupid phone @Dave Looks like GC gets the 6,666th comment award! (*cues party favors and celebratory music*) ^"Cheetah Cub" ... and @GC wins the coveted 6666! Oh God! 22 comments in 15 minutes?! All I did was eat half my lunch! Argh stupid phone @Dave I would make a Cthulhu-Ducken myself, but I don't like squid/octopus and dislike wasting food. Lol @Date, that's the sort of thing I would do! ;) ^"Cheetah Cub" nm Oh, I must have missed that one! There were a couple massive chat chunks that I had to give up on reading unfortunately. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Aether, if it's more than a couple of days ago, youcan search the comment archive at www.cubsubcorps.com/KickStarterComments.html Anja "Cha! Cub" Schulz Superbacker 2 days ago Congratulations @Aether *smiles* you deserved that 'k'. And are hereby awarded the appreciatetly growly soft fuzzy furry ball of 'Ok!!' Award!! ^"Cheetah Cub" "I have a baby and I blew it ... Sounds like you forgot to use the condom. Not exactly the EKLOL award but yes... aww man, I'm gonna need the periscope to scroll down... ok here we go. I mean, if it's clearly the same baby that kind of proves the point.... Nah, it's okay DtQ. If you can get a pic with the same baby next to a sign, they'll probably take it then. We need to update that for BvB...... I have a baby and I blew it I feel like I let the corps down:( The EKLOL award? My apologies everyone. I also have an idea for a tank I can retake the photos soon Oh maan! DtQ hahaha that's terrible haha you shall earn the pink furry ball of enlightment... or something like that... Cha! was the one who named it, so maybe she recalls better what the name was (I could search in the periscope but... nahh) I know In the words of the poet Homer... "D'oh!" I took some baby beard photos today... but somehow even though I was holding the Hashtag sign I didn't include it in the photo! ::Facepalm:: AHEM *Announcer Voice* "(I think he's going for that 6,666th comment Zem, it's going to be a close call... will someone swing in at the last second and nab it?! Stay tuned to find out.....)" Wow, CB! Thanks for taking over the spam! ;) ` This Machu Picchu stuff is due to the type of music that's all the rage on here these days. I can't get my favorite album of it out of my head now, and probably won't for a week. <url>` Also, my secret for spam is first, to try to be here when others are. That's the hardest part, especially since often the comments seem to perfectly slow down JUST as I get here. But if you're here with everyone else, then just respond to most things and contribute to everything on your own. Bonus comments if you never let one comment be longer than one sentence like Epicderpguy did. That's when it's actually spam. 57 comments? Man, I guess I missed the memo about us practicing blowing up the comments for the last day of the campaign! ;) Nah, that was last night. That was a heck of a rehearsal! ^"Cheetah Cub" Yeah, that was the one. Thanks @Aether Things are doing all right I would hope we could get more people to post their vote stuff.... I figured we'd get that at least in two to three days, giving time for people to get around to posting it. do you mean the one posted by 'Nick' ? That one is already counted in the 8 we have ;) ^"Cheetah Cub" <url>"Cheetah Cub" I found another speech on Twitter, but it's in a stupid frame and I can't get the actual link. Anyone know if it's been counted? BIG ampule A jet injector with a bit ampule attached clearly labeled "BEAR STEROIDS"... ^"Cheetah Cub" Any new provoke posts yet? ^"Cheetah Cub" A baby being held/rocked by someone in a bear suit. ^"Cheetah Cub" A baby lying on a skateboard being pushed from behind. ^"Cheetah Cub" A baby being held over a tub full of ice. ^"Cheetah Cub" I don't know how @Zem does it. While I'm spamming the comments, I notice that very few other comments are showing up. Maybe everyone's just lurking, waiting for me to shut up. Not likely though, because all of my spam is on topic. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Dr.P. Don't give up on any of the achievements. When I got my tattoo, there were a few people discussing how unlikely that was to happen. The bears thing is doable. We just haven't done it ... yet! ^"Cheetah Cub" I still think @Zem's in the lead though. ^"Cheetah Cub" Yay for me, I got the 6621st comment!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ^"Cheetah Cub" Oh, there it is ... right next to the "Comments" link. ... DUH! ^"Cheetah Cub" I never go for the nnnnth comment, because I haven't figured out how to determine what number we're at. ^"Cheetah Cub" A baby in a cradle about to be tipped onto the floor. I think CB is secretly going for the 6666th comment..... ^"Cheetah Cub" +1, Justin. ^"Cheetah Cub" A feathered cat toy about to touch the baby's nose. ^"Cheetah Cub" ... with a pin ... Air horn ^"Cheetah Cub" ... or a water balloon ... ^"Cheetah Cub" ... or a super-soaker ... ^"Cheetah Cub" A squirt gun at point-blank range aimed at a baby's face. ^"Cheetah Cub" A Ptero-Baby descending on to a real baby. (Babies vs babies, but still funny) ^"Cheetah Cub" It's really fun thinking these up. ^"Cheetah Cub" This one's a little far fetched, but how about a baby with an exposed tummy and a tattoo gun about to tattoo the hashtag on said belly? @cb I'm going to do the cthuluducken this weekend if I don't burn down the house trying lol ^"Cheetah Cub" If anyone has relatives or friends with babies, go visit them this weekend and bring along a beard and a tank. Or photograph the moment before a Bris. ^"Cheetah Cub" I hope some of you are taking notes ... I'm trying to inspire someone. ^"Cheetah Cub" Or a baby holding a piece of candy while someone reaches in to take it away. @CB I know you're right... I should ask for permission... OR I could try to be the best ninja in the world using modern sly techniques to take a picture. oooh I like the cymbal idea! and the kitten one too! those are great! I think Cha should follow her idea of a new provoke card and try a nappie wedgie provoke pic Or you could just print out the CNN Headline "TRUMP WINS!" and put it over the crib... Those are some great ideas @CB! I would definitely try to do something interesting if I knew a baby! Mmmm... Crash Cymbal Baby Provocation... ^"Cheetah Cub" Or someone could hold a kitten over a baby as if to drop it. ^"Cheetah Cub" It would be hilarious if someone would stand over a sleeping baby with a pair of cymbals in their hands. Any percussionists out there? ^"Cheetah Cub" I also like the cornet idea. Too many provoke pictures are just someone poking with a finger. I'm waiting for more loud musical instrument, sticks of dynamite, baseball bats, precipitous drops from dizzying heights, etc. Remember, you don't have to go through with it. Just make it LOOK like you could go through with it. (No babies were harmed in the making of this photo ...) We may have to do without the 50 bears, but we can spare that if we get some of the easier ones out of the way. If I knew someone with a baby I would have at least a provoke done. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Aether, this is one time I would hesitate to follow my policy of, "never ask permission, but always ask forgiveness." I think I would ask permission in this case. Haha @Aether, that's a terrifying thought! That's a brilliant idea, just don't get caught! ;) I think I will go to a mall and discretely take a picture of a cornet (with the note) near to a sleeping baby @GC maybe try babysitting? hahaha Urgh, I've eaten waaaay too much. If anyone needs me, I'll be sleeping off this massive burger and chips in the corner... Or exploding. Explosions may occur This is the one time I wish I knew a baby! Unfortunately I literally know no babies, and I've contributed to all of the other ones that I can ^"Cheetah Cub" Anyone with a baby, or a friend or relative with a baby, can help out in three categories: tank, beard, and provoke. ... and please make sure that it's three separate photos, each of them with the handwritten hashtag. ^"Cheetah Cub" That Cthulu-Ducken is a must. We also NEED that 50 bear posers picture. The speech isn't that hard to do. Just post a video of something so that we can be done with that one. for the first time in a month I overslept and that amount of comments took me a lot of time to read haha now I'm listening andean music and I want waffles which are not common here in Mexico and neither do pumpkins, so it's very unlikely for me to contribute with that one. I must find a baby. ^"Cheetah Cub" What's all of this Machu Picchu stuff? Is that supposed to be for a stretch goal? Oh, just a sec then. Yeah, those are some of the more popular ones to cover. The third link is less common, so I'd try to use that one to find them, because I found like 6 versions of the first two. Actually, you could use those to find a broader spectrum of bands I guess. I always google like album, cd, or song, whichever apply, some clues to the music, and any keywords that pop up in your head, which is why this was harder to find since I didn't remember any words whatsoever, nor could I remember any in the songs. I don't know, I know it's annoying, but you should find them in time. We already have someone who said they were going to do the cthulhu-ducken this weekend. That sounds like Los Cochas. I almost thought that was just a regular band because it's such a regular name. You mean an english name? ` Well, sorry, gotta go now. See if you can find anything in the meantime. These: <url>"Cheetah Cub" New counts are up at www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.htm and we still need four more achievements to unlock the Amazing Secret Box of Incredible Awesomeness. We still need beard babies, provokes, pumpkins (seriously, am I going to have to get medieval on a pumpkin? It won't be pretty.) tank babies, Speeches/Anthems, bear bellies, voting bears (unlkely at this point) voting stickers (also unlikely) Cthulu-Ducken, 50 bear posers, and backers. They had a very commercialized name I think...very general. Let me check I'll share which tunes I recognize Was it Los Cochas? They had another album like this that I found. And whoever wrote Aguas Claras, I think. Those are pretty much the only other bands I found, but maybe it'll help? I'm gonna go through my boxes of cds and maybe I had uploaded them to my iTunes library... I just really liked their version... I know @Zem...when I last looked I found like one or two vids online and it required the darn name I'm thinking it's more the processing, additives and coloring in our food responsible for all sorts of allergies and food related ailments ? Cha, a specific group of the Andean musicians? I found several while looking for my group, but if yours isn't one of the ones I linked in the other videos and playlist before I finally found that band, then chances are they're like my group and impossible to find online. ^"Cheetah Cub" ... Ezekiel ... I promise I hadn't browsed in weeks for anything but I had apparently set reminders and just could not restrain myself... Oh yeah and that happened... *hangs head for non restraint backing* ^"Cheetah Cub" Some people eat "Esekial bread," which is made out of a weird mixture of grains. Some people swear by that too. @Zem...so listening again to your music there's a number of tunes I recognize, it's just a different interpretation??? I gotta find the name of my group dang it ^"Cheetah Cub" Sorry, @Zem. Matzohs are leaven-free, not gluten-free, which means they don't contain the yeast that makes all of that carbon dioxide in the first place. If they're made out of ordinary wheat flour, they contain gluten. So... the jews were way ahead of the game on the gluten-free train? Heehee, if unleavened bread counts, the Hebrews were the biggest food hipsters of all time! I know basically what it is, just not exactly how it does anything in cooking. Glad I have nothing against gluten or milk, because I have way too much of both! ^"Cheetah Cub" Gluten-free bread is basically a cracker. ^"Cheetah Cub" Gluten is the stuff that captures the carbon dioxide from the yeast, forming little air pockets and causing the bread to rise. It used to be highly praised until recently. Well, not strange allergies. But you get my meaning, things that aren't common. Unless it's ADD, everyone seems to have that. It's a type of protein (a chain/mixture) found in grains, some people just can't break it down. Well some people can be sensitive to gluten, but literally everyone? No, I think not. Some health things are just weird fads too, since it's somehow (oddly...) cool to have strange allergies (?). I know 2 people with serious gluten intollerance. I know about 8-10 people who eat gluten free. Because it's... healthier? Because they're masochists? ` I don't know exactly what gluten is, all I know is it tastes DELICIOUS! Yeah, that is an unfortunate fact. Don't even get me started on "food babe" or whoever. Yea I want to know the stats on people who are gluten free for no reason and just are a pita to friends and family ^"Cheetah Cub" All true, but most people believe whatever the commercials and Dr. Oz tell them. That's not making a healthy waffle, that's making a health nut waffle... unless you just can't eat gluten. Sugar isn't bad for you unless you eat too much of it. I saw a chia waffle once in the health isle ^"Cheetah Cub" @Dr.P. You make it out of soy protein, so it's gluten free. Then you make it in a factory that doesn't process nuts, because you don't want to trigger anyone's nut allergy. Then you top it with sorghum so that it's sugar-free and to ensure that it tastes like crap. Or using it for something savory rather than sweet? How do you make a waffle healthy? Just eat it plain? Heathy waffle...I would divorce my wife if she brought that in my house! At least you're roommate isn't a toe nibbler That was a very quick nap @Zem ;) So it was Less than a week left of the campaign! Oh Wow, one class and a full page of comments? I thought the crazy spam was limited to last night! I'm so proud of you all! You're making my job as Chief of Spam that much easier. In fact, you guys can handle it from here. I'm gonna take a quick nap! I think that tweet was from yesterday I can't get oatmeal's link to work via mobile That pie sounds delicious cub Cake! Hrs doing live drawing of card ideas Check out @Oatmeal's Tweet: <url>"Cheetah Cub" Yeah, I have to keep my shoes on all day for protection, not so much from teeth, but from claws. my roommate's dog is a toe-nibbler. I feel your pain! ^"Cheetah Cub" Cappuccino's doing great. His favorite toy is a tennis ball. (That is, next after biting my fingers, of course.) How's your dog doing, CB? hahaha... yes. i have downed one cup of coffee and eaten a crappy healthy "waffle" ^"Cheetah Cub" Feeling better now. Coffee consumed, breakfast eaten, kids off the lawn. :-) Of course! That would look awesome! ^"Cheetah Cub" @Cub-Cake, sweet! Please post a picture when you're done. I was going to pay homage to you! and Yup! A flexed arm with the tattoo! :) Bacon caramel cream with speculoos crust.... omg that sounds amazing. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Cub-Cake, I like the idea of the tattoo cookies, but won't they just wind up being Bears vs Babies cookies? Or are you going to make arm-shaped cookies with the tattoo on them? Good morning, CB! And then gotta get to work on some Thanksgiving pies. Bacon Caramel cream with speculoos crust methinks... ^"Cheetah Cub" @Quack, yeah I saw @LZ's posts. The first thing I do in the morning is get caught up on the comments, no matter how many there are. I'm praying for @LZ. Dealing with something like that is never easy and it's good to have this community to support hom. Life's good quite here, nearly the weekend. Looking forward to seeing that :) Adulting has been a topic of conversation lately. And how much it sucks. Just another birthday cake and some cookies. Thanks! Doing well here, adulting my way through Veterans Day. Anything in particular to be baked? You just always make such good looking food, I'm curious. How is everyone else? Life is treating me quite well. I'm trying to find some babies I can poke. Volunteering at ASPCA today, so i'll poke a baby kitten. :) Hi @Cub-Cake! How's life? i know, I know! I have a wee bit more time before my next baking rush. :) HIya. Cub Cake two days in a row! Morning, all. I wonder if I'm going to get holiday pay at the grocery store tonight... If my company gave us the day off, I'd still be here (essential personnel), but I'd be getting paid a lot more. CB did you know you missed Lord Zombitten least night?! I'm doing well thanks GC Morning @Dave! Good thanks, under 2 hours left of the work day here :) How are you? How goes everything? Morning folks! ^"Cheetah Cub" I would rather be working today, but I'm a contractor and all of the regular employees are taking the day off, except they're getting paid for it. Ahh okay, that makes more sense than the company I work for just being completely mean then ;) Holiday's here are either a holiday or not as far as I'm aware! ^"Cheetah Cub" I wish @GCoD was here. I need him to chase some kids off my lawn. Oh, well it is a holiday. But it falls into one of those "let's make sure we recognize this" holidays not everyone takes off work from (save maybe federal employees). It's more about taking a sincere moment than it is a free day off.... though it is quite a party time for the USMC: Voting day, USMC birthday, and veterans day all in a row. So what was it? About a million USD ago when they told us to stop giving them money? @Dr. P - Talking about Veterans Day. Did I miss something along the way? You guys did too much talking for me to go back and practically read at this point. For example, mine sure doesn't... @Ginger - It's a government holiday, but not many corps give the day off. @CB - Sorry 'bout that. Just looked at the name on the account. Hope your morning improves! ^"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, don't worry about it. I was trying to figure out how to tell you without hurting your feelings. Just chalk it up to the fact that I'm basically a grumpy old man. lol Zem I'm sorry, it was just a prank, bro! I mean... wow, jeez, this mattress seems like a jerk! (sorry, I wasn't going to do it anymore. Now I can't, I have to go back into hiding) Didn't realise it was a holiday in the US. I work for a US company and all the Americans are in work today - looks like someone forgot to tell them! ;) ^"Cheetah Cub" I guess I need more sleep. I'm noticing that I'm very grumpy today and I apologize. ^"Cheetah Cub" @James McKendrew, please ignore @Zem. He's just messing with me. Please call me CB, or Cheetah Cub. Thanks. ^"Cheetah Cub" Well, the "official" site hasn't been updated for two days and today's a holiday and tomorrow starts the weekend. I hope we don't have to wait until Monday to get another update. By then there will only be three days left to get the other achievements done. @Aether, do you have any unofficial totals to tide us over? G'morning Mike, Dr... Morning @CB and @Dr.P, how are you two today? Don't know if there's been anything new yet so far ^"Cheetah Cub" Good morning cubs. Any new achievements? I feel the same way. I wanted to keep talking to LZ more myself but I just started nodding off. ^"Cheetah Cub" I'm genuinely ticked off with a certain mattress though. I have worked very hard to get people to stop calling me by my real name and use my alias like everyone else and HE had to make a big stupid joke about deliberately using my real name. I'll get back at him somehow. I just don't know when. ^"Cheetah Cub" Oh sure. I finally get so exhausted that I actually go to bed early one night and that's whene EVERYONE COMES OUT! Everyone must have decided to stay up because today's a holiday in the US. Trying to keep the internet running. Mostly, this chunk is ok. Pretty good thank you. Had to fix someone else's error this morning, but now that's done it should be a quiet afternoon. How are you today? How's your afternoon going? Well at least that's something to look forward to Indeed. And Saturdays are fairly easy days. Aww, that's a shame. Thursday is good too though, nearly there :) That's a lovely thought, but I work on Saturdays. So this is more of a Thursday, for me. At least it's Friday ;) I hate mornings. 225 comments while I was sleeping... Morning all! Morning @Aether :D Farewell wherever you fare until your eyries meet you at the journey's end! Selamat malam! Buenas noches!! :) Gute Nacht!! :) suddenly I'm feeling very sleepy... Night Cha! Night Zem! see you tomorrow =) Good morning Ginger Cub, I know you will pop up anytime soon haha. I-iiiim the cult of personali-... No. NO! Bad Zem! Bed! Now! *whimpers* that second part is faster than anything I have ever sung.... and that's something, believe me haha Okay, that was just a warmup. This time it's for real! ` I am not messing up the covers. Sliding in so as not to wrinkle all the sheets making sure the quilt stays nice and clean Have you ever seen a bed so neat? I'm getting intooo bed! ... sleepsleepsleeptimetogotosleepnow itisnightandineedtosleepwhileitisdark iamreallytiredtimeforsleep nowtiredtiredsleepsleepsleep I'm getting into bed! ` <url>` NO! Time for sleep! "Show 1 newer comment" now 2... well... okay. <url>ón I believe it is The Andean music? Yeah, alot of these are folk songs, but I like this guy/group's versions of them alot, plus they're good quality recordings, all in a neat album, so it's super nice for listening! ` Also, I used to say "traditiooooooon!" at the end, but I figured most people would completely miss the hard-to-make reference to Fiddler on the Roof. There's some more amazing music for you, Geist! One of the best musicals/operas I know! I thought you may knew them. I just really like that one albumofgheirs which I'd heard over and over again It's a great tradition!! ;) It's more feelings I remember anyho I'll find 'em I love that tradition ahaha Man it sounds so familiar!! It may be the same songs these my guys played just with their own twist and they sang. AAAaanyways... ` I am not messing up the covers. Sliding in so as not to wrinkle all the sheets making sure the quilt stays nice and clean Have you ever seen a bed so neat? I'm getting intooo bed! ... sleepsleepsleeptimetogotosleepnow itisnightandineedtosleepwhileitisdark iamreallytiredtimeforsleep nowtiredtiredsleepsleepsleep I'm getting into bed! ` <url>"oh yeah, that reminds me of this" music! Heck, if my dad was here, he could turn it into literally an entire day of history/music lessons, everything from jazz, rock, metal, classical, anything in between, and back again. That's why I love History of Rock class so much! Anyway, I better be skedaddling. Wow, that's a word even by the KS word editor? Huh, this thing keeps surprising me. Anyways, my last song of the night... And I'll find the Andean guys too Héroes Del Silencio - Maldito Duende <url>"all of his charisma for the next month") and will be on twitter as soon as it converts to mp4. Productive evening! And I only missed 68 comments while recording :P Wow, I didn't know Guantanamera was one of the songs on that album! But still nowhere NEAR as good as Buena Vista Social Club's version! Dang you, Cha!! Now it's spreading to Cuban music! I'm such a college boy... Trust me, I could share literally dozens of Julian things, all of which would be the funniest thing you've seen all day! Some were just funny, but too many for one person were all way too good! It's bittersweet feel good music. It's good I need to find the actual band/songs I'm Looking for. It's bugging me. I think I found some of theirs on the net before but I need the name. I may have the cd around somewhere for the name or look in my iTunes library. I bought their cd back in Germany when they played in the pedestrian zone in Kassel where I studied. And thanks for sharing Julian...like it!! It's all good, but this group we already had a cd of has most of the best versions of the songs I found multiples of yesterday. Anyways, after this song finishes, time for the Sleep Song. ;) Damn you, Cha!! I'm still listening to that music! Still especially Purimuy and Aguas Claras! The Andean stuff. I love it so much! Why'd you have to remind me?! @Zem... hahaha ...heyyy I'm honestly surprised we haven't unlocked the pumpkin carving goal yet. Seeing as it doesn't require a baby or a pregnancy, I'd like to think it will be simple to get. For @Aether... Héroes del Silencio - Entre dos tierras <url>"I'm sorry, do you need to go or something?!" "There's an arrow in my..." "I'm like going through alot right now and I'm trying to tell you about it!" "I'm going to die." "There is no excuse, you are embarrassing me!" ` classic! @Aether sounds good. Saturday afternoon will be when I have time so I'll post it Saturday evening Hi, Leo! Oh, sorry, *google translate noises* paomdsin iioo .,..............................32ii3 ijpaoedijf ijpoakijpei jp jfa 8afpdif illuminatiisreal a;ikldnmaoifpdeiknfeiioa;hofiapodhnfpoanbpdunfuna jn nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn @Justin, I would say go for it! I think most people is trying to do it un Sunday and who knows, maybe some family reunion emerges or something He's in psycho attack mode at the moment. I keep trying to avoid the fangs of death. HAHAHA! I nearly forgot about this Julian Smith classic! One of his more... WTFingF?! moments, it's amazing! <url>` And yes, this is the same guy. If you don't know him, he was one of the very earliest youtube stars, and even nearly 10 years ago made stuff that would still pass as amazing today! No idea how he came up with the idea for Jeffrey, though. He did it for Jellyfish and people loved the character, so he made a full person from him. Cha, I can get it out of your head: <url>"I forgot the bacon! How could I forget the BACON!?!" Potattens new babies are SOOO cute! How is it nearly 1 am? this is what I get for being distracted by you lovely people! Dang it, Creeper, no! I need kittens now! besides bacon makes everything better! hahaha yes Zem, talking to your brother... hahaha LZ please name your Cducken after you give birth to it LZ you're right my apologies. The Cthulduckening. That should be a new horror movie. The volunteers are too busy nuzzling kittens and helping animals get adopted! I wish we had time to play. LZ- i have complete faith in you and your Cthduadflkjasdng cooking. There's definitely crab and bacon in that picture. I think CB and LZ were the main instigators of crazy over at EK... Aether, the talking to my brother? Yeah, I debated putting that detail in, but then I realized it's been over half an hour, and that would seem long for just taking a dump. ;) He'll be bummed he missed LZ for sure That's the spirit LZ! Though from their picture it only looks like a squid and a duck. Haha, I can't imagine how ticked CB will be- sorry, Cheetah Cub/ the Kabala guy- will be tomorrow when he gets on and sees what just happened after he went to sleep! I think I might try to do a Cthulhuducken this weekend. I'm a pretty good cook; how hard can it be? I just need a duck, a chicken, octopus or squid, crab, and an eldritch horror or two. Piece of cake, eh! and I'm not talking about the 44 comments I'm a strong believer in positive thoughts helping and negative not doing any good for you. Go out and provoke a baby...or cook a chtuluducken(though I'm really not sure how I feel about that TBH) too much information Zem XD HOLY HELL 44 comments?! All I did was go to take a crap! Well, and complain a little to my brother and someone else about the class, but seriously! Just don't explode the actual kittens... Indeed. I was sitting on the couch being bored and sullen. Then I remembered this is a thing and decided to come back. It's nice to have a haven on the Internet. Read the cards to the cats or play it with them :) CubCake I'm glad you're enjoying it so much. You should bring your EK deck and play with the other volunteers sometime! @CupCake..I've always had the same concerns about volunteering. Glad to hear it's been a good experience for you!! The Cthulhuducken will get unlocked... I'm positive about it. And I sense that the pic with 50 bears will get unlocked too LZ I'm glad your getting treated and hopefully this is something good to distract you from less positive thoughts. Keep positive my friend. Oh man @LZ *big hugz* I wish you lots of positive energy and spirit to fight this! I hope someone unlocks the Cthulhuducken achievement! It kinda goes with the deep madness campaign that has about 11 hrs. left. The community of backers there reminds me of the backers here. Also. kittens. like. so many kittens. I will lay on the floor and unleash a litter on me and it's the best escape ever. provoke other people's babies! that's awesome! LZ, sorry to hear that :S we send you bear force and good thoughts! I love it!!! Actually, i really started getting involved partly because of EK and their work with the shelters. After our playtest party, donating our raffle collection to a shelter- I really wanted to stay involved. So I tried to volunteer there, but they were full. Signed up for ASPCA. I love it!! I was worried that I'd want to take home animals all the time. But they get adopted so fast, it's ok! And if dogs have a hard time getting adopted, they rotate to different locations, or do the inmate-rehab program. It's been a really wonderful experience. If you want more items that's one thing...but it's on them if they underestimated their costs. I second the kitten provoke pic!! heheeh "provoke the kitten" WILL DO. Also you rock for working with the ASPCA provoke the kitten. One of the pictures in their gallery for "baby dressed as a bear" is a dog...So I don't see why a kitten wouldn't count for this. Oh - so this is weird- I received an email from another campaign that ended last year. They asked for donations or purchasing of more items because they underestimated costs and still haven't paid their printer!!! I thought that was a little strange... don't they received quotes and prices beforehand?? They had a beautifully successful campaign and everyone received their items. Very lovely people. Oh wow... 8 more comments while I was writing. @DtQ: Yes, that is the plan! Wow a lot of activity in the last hour!! Hi Cub-cake! bye cub-cake! good to see you, I like the mood you have right now, really positive and funny haha. And yes Cha! that shout out from elan was amazing :) Amanda that's great! we really need those anthems/speeches to be posted by several backers =D DtQ, congrats on your new job!! Zem, just remember than in a couple of years it will be over and you will have other priorities by then =) that thought always helps me to keep up when I feel frustrated. (I hope not to have shuffled up all the information I just read) *sigh* LZ. it's all so much. I hate that you have to go through this. Do it! It couldn't hurt! LZ I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sure you'll kick cancer's ass! @Zem..aww the glorious college days. I have to admit I learned the most outside the traditional classes (even if I also completed those). Like student government and conceptualizing and facilitating a class for freshmen class (paid!) on teamwork for 3 semesters. So true that one learns best by doing :) hope you'll get your schedule figured out!! Hmm... what if i provoke a sleeping baby kitten?? :| probably needs to be human. But i'm volunteering at ASPCA tomorrow and could do it. DtQ, I haven't been on here much because my life went to hell around the time the campaign launched. I had a seizure on October 8, which heralded the presence of a brain tumor. It was removed two days later. 8 days after that, I was told that I have brain cancer. I've been absent while I have been coping with the news. @Cha! - Well, after finding out I can't just do things myself, I needed to find another way to feel like I'm making progress. Good Night @CupCake...and I meant bake the Cook a "Cthulu-Ducken" which we haven't completed yet.... @Amanda..like your Taskmaster spirit :) OK good night Cub-Cake. See you soon Good luck with cleaning! I know the feeling. Just convinced a friend to record an anthem. Will be up on Facebook soon. Hoping to get a speech tonight too out of another person. That really is great DtQ! What a great encounter. Ok... I have to get off the computer. Because I keep reading the news and I'm ready to just hibernate for awhile. I must clean! This place is a wreck! I'll check in again soon! And again - I do truly wish I was more active this go-around! But thanks to everyone who has been so diligent! Thanks LZ. How are things with you. I feel I haven't seen you on this comment board. Adulting sure does suck DtQ, that's awesome! Congrats! I could go for a homemade cookie right about now even though I should be going to bed. LZ I will definitely accept it. They aren't even interviewing anyone else...I actually met the one guy at my night job as a cashier at a grocery store. He asked me what I did I said I was a developer but unemployed. He asked me to send a resume over and they basically interviewed just me! @Cha! But we unlocked that one! I did send the BvB oreo bars to the EK team. :) Was gonna do some more. Was actually going to create CB Tattoo cookie! Might do it anyway. i hate adulting so much, LZ. It's so physically and mentally exhausting. And it never ends. IT NEVER ENDS UNTIL THE SWEET KISS OF DEATH.... ... i'm fine guys. I'm. fine. How about making a dessert out of the food challenge? I'm Sure you could do it @ CupCake :) Yeah..... LZ did not have a good work day. because people. are. the. worst. Zem - Your correlation is much cuter. Toasty fur baby snuggles! Quack - It's like waiting for your crush to message you back! You'll accept it though, right? I had someone decline an offer on me today because I had scheduled an interview with someone else before she called to say she was interested. Cub-Cake I know and I'm confident I'm getting an offer I just hate waiting! Toasty fur sounds like something you'd say when a warm kitty snuggles next to you, not normally when fur from a hairy toaster gets inside the burners and actually toasts fur. Alison a little fur on your toast is worth the box upgrade! Leonidas has gotten into the habit of pawing at the tv incessantly while I watch.... It was cute the first 30 seconds... Mmm....toasty fur. Dave- yep... that's where I checked adn realized they were completed. Durrrr. and Oh the waiting part for a new job and making sure it's actually finalized is stressful. Best of luck to you! Zem - sorry about the aggravation. Incredibly frustrating! You just want to learn! I used my toaster for the first time today. I must have gotten some stray fur inside, lovely burning smell It's all because of how late I'm enrolling (why do you need to do it before even halfway through the semester?! You have no idea what your grades will be, though if you don't pass, that allows for some nice loopholes;), but I couldn't help it. I had no clue what to go for until just today. that is frustrating Details: I wanted a writing credit out of the way, but JGEN 120, 200, 300, ENGL 150, 254 all full. Two other classes for different requirement credits are also full, one is either full or during another, more important class, and several just don't work. Dang it! I give up. I've spent WAY too long on this. I'll just go see an advisor or something. good luck Zem I'm glad I'm done with all that Its easier to tell from the cub sub page plus you can see how many we need <url># Breathe LZ... let it flow through. *bighugz* That Robo's theme song totally sounds like Rick Astley!! <url># Speaking of earworms Ugh! Things could be better. I left a long tirade about it on the EK KS. How goes it LZ? Grumble, grumble, gripe and moan! <url>"I'd rather be poor and have drugs than be rich and have none!" And yes, they do have an election 2016 expansion! @Micah an election themed expansion pack would be perfect! hopefully they reconsider Harrison, no, whenever they even read a request remotely political, they just turned it down immediately. I don't blame them, though an election expansion pack would have been pretty funny! Dang it, Aether! Now I've had that song in my head for hours, even above the Andean music Cha got stuck back in my head! Your song is good! ... TOO good. It'll have to be destroyed. *Dun dun DUNNNN!* Sorry i missed the live streamed was tied up somewhere else at the time.. hopefully you would consider Trump hands (baby small) :) People is starting to upload pics again :) and we are 10k away from the 75k backers achievement Good night, Kabala guy. PoW bear ^"Cheetah Cub" OK, I'm going to bed now. Goodnight. ^"Cheetah Cub" OK, Philson guy, if that" the way it's going to be. Hey, Kabala guy it is then! ` PC, I'm not sure if that's a rare shot from a peacetime treaty or if that baby is a prisoner of the bears and is like sending a message back to the babies about a ransom. ^"Cheetah Cub" The joke's on you, @Zem. CB is fine. Just not that Kabala guy. Just stumbled across this, while looking at other things. <url>"Cheetah Cub" Guys, the words in qoutes above are what I prefer to be called. Thanks. @Kabala Thanks for the info :) ^"Cheetah Cub" Oh wow. This is starting to sound like those "other" campaigns. Somebody start the roleplaying for tonight. They are probably incredibly busy and bombarded by emails. Also they said the rules are still subject to change and not set in stone. ^"Cheetah Cub" @House, according to Ashley, the Art achievement has been unlocked. However, <url>"Cheetah Cub" My guess for what to call a group of babies is, "nursery." He actually went through the Q and A submitted questions and said There is nothing new here that hasn't been answered. So that's one of a a very small sampling, and I should have put the lol. Oft assumed which is the folly of man. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Steve Faddis ,there were way too many people logged on for it to be possible to answer everyone's individual question. I'm sure your question was not intentionally overlooked. If it really means tht much to you, you could try sending Elan a private message. I'd go easy on the, "I demand satisfaction" rhetoric, though. Hold it now! My question was not answered but totally overlooked in the Dev Session!!! Mr Elan Lee I demand satisfaction!!!! Rules question here: If multiple people have equal strength against a baby horde what decides who gets the points? Also what is a group of babies called? Swarm, fez, gaggle, Unholy terror? AHA! Cha, I think I finally found the full everything I was looking for by google searching several things, finally something like Runa Pacha machu picchu cd. This is the full album we own that's virtually impossible to find somehow. <url>"Cheetah Cub" Has anyone heard from Ashley? I haven't seen an update all day. And what'd I tell you, Cha, I still have that music stuck in my head! Especially Purimuy and Aguas Clara. Weird.... Yeah, I had that open. Unfortunately, the replay only lets me move about 3 minutes on the bar on the bottom, and I can watch after that, but if I try to click to a different time on the bar, my only options are 0~3 min, and if I'm past that, I lose all that progress and would have to watch again. Yes Zem, truly missed indeed: <url>"Cheetah Cub" The Oatmeal always draws whatever he wants to draw, so the chance of getting your drawing done is just about nil. At least he said no to all of the political requests. Yeah it was :) That was fun! It would have been awesome! but the Crabbin' was really nice too Yeah, I was kinda trying to get them to draw the sub, but oh well ^"Cheetah Cub" Rather disappointing they didn't notice the "I" in McThundersquish. I couldn't se how to 'access' the live chat...and I lost the stream as they were winding up...BUGGER! Hi, from Australia! My alarm didn't go off.... good morning Thank you!! :) Will there be a iPhone app like the last game? Live feed available later! live feed will be available later :) ooh, i can see my comment now! refreshed, different browsers, different devices, not working i can't comment either :( Did you try refreshing your browser? @IC neither can I Can't comment on the live stream :-( Really wish I wasn't working right now. Jealous of all that can get on the stream! Also, please please ask for an update on the stretch goals! @Cha! I sure hope so. I can't do audio right now. With all the new BVB, I guess we should make more rooms in Crawfish McThundersquish Baby-Q Sauce; Baby (BB) gun baby; I'd love to see a Spare tire (for a middle bear part please!!! Can someone ask if it'll be available as a recording after? Please!! Welcome lots of new BvB backers!! :) That's a neat new feature!! :( just got live feed on and kicked right off How do I comment on the live stream? Oooh I missed that comment @Aether! You're welcome! It's getting exciting! Did you read that about selfies? As long you have a reliable internet connection, most browsers should work just fine for viewing the live stream. Get ready to ask questions, send selfies, and post comments to show your support for the creator and their project. Having that social media following really helps when you're trying to do any campaign. Here's a mini boost: Please all follow @AetherTower on Twitter and and like their Facebook page!! <url>"Zem's Memorial Mattress" no one how much of an inside joke it may be.... In @Zem's case that just totally does not work. Posting music keeps him from sleeping heck posting anything squirrels him from sleeping ;) Hey, stuffs is happening today. :) I think a good card would be "Cha! Cha! Cha! (Lullaby): Try to put the babies back to sleep..." I'm looking forward to it too! Ooh that's a good idea @Cha!! @Aether... just checked out your Hero game...looks very interesting and am looking forward to its relaunch!! :) hmm I'm trying to find the Follow option on your account... :D Thanks @Clayton! I'm glad you all liked it, more than a contribution towards the Art goal, I really wanted this song to be enjoyed by our fellow backers ;) @Aether Tower you got talent man! That is awesome. <url>"Cheetah Cub" OK, slurking is now in the dictionary. I had to wait to make sure it was really a thing before adding it, since I invented the term. www.cubsubcorps.com/Dictionary.html Totally new word for dictionary!! Well, time to go back to the shadows. (psst, I'll actually be gone, but don't tell CB that!) I think it would be an excellent addition to the dictionary ;) To lurk while sleeping. Does slurking need to be added to the dictionary now, CB? ;) My guess is it's only an hour... Two tops Haha! I love it sped up like that! Especially the end, which is already so much faster! At the end, if you put it to 2x speed, it sounds like you're fastforwarding a movie or something! ^"Cheetah Cub" Aha! @Zem has been slurking! CB, nope, I only pretend to sleep. I'm still listening to that music, that's why I haven't commented since like midnight. ` Dang it, I might miss the stream! I may be able to make it for a short time, but unless it goes for several hours, it's right when I won't be able to stay! Thanks everybody! Haha, sped up is awesome! I love that, it's so good! Good luck @Dave, we're all rooting for you! :) @Quack.. good luck & wits!! @Cha hahahaha it took me half an hour to achieve it and now I like to set the YouTube configuration to 1.25x speed. I would have loved to have Hi resolution images... Best of luck @Quack! I'm still sad I can't go later but this meeting is important. I'm hoping to get a new job...I may vomit So good!! I'm amazed how you sang that, especially the fast part :) And I'm going to listen to it again now..something that'll make me smile Frightened Bear by @Aether <url>ías @Cha & @Ginger cub! hahaha with all the music you share and you still have the 'burrs' haha. I can't get rid of the 'hooooooo wah wah' of the bears in my head either. Buenos días @Aether ...I still have your adorable 'burrs' in my head :) Hope the nsfw booster pack is what I imagine and more I added my ideas too (cause I know I'll forget within the next 3 hours!) "brain" is in quotes because I'm not sure about all of our(that includes mine) I submitted a question describing where we were in our "brain"storming session last night with the CB tattoo Morning @Aether! morning! looks like today is one of those days when everybody is active! +1 to the wedgie :) I found it I appreciate people giving me credit for the CB card! This knot in this dresser looks like a smiling bear <url>"instant pillow/blanket fortress: safety in lalaland." ^"Cheetah Cub" Maybe he's sleeping right now, or lurking. ... Slurking. Morning @CB :) That's how I feel when I go to bed! I don't think he does... ^"Cheetah Cub" Morning cubbies. Good to see everyone showed up last night after I went to bed yet again. Oh well, gives me something to read in the morning. Btw, does @Zem EVER sleep? id like to see a pit of babies, or a guillotine baby..oo or pendulum babeh Love the sound of a card in honour of @CB's tattoo, think we should also have a Crawfish McThundersquish card ;) Urgh I miss so much conversation due to the need to sleep! So excited for the live thingy, it'll be 7pm here, perfect! :) Great, I wanted to go to sleep, now look what you did, Cha!! Aha! Runa Pacha! I can never find that name! Also, probably Los Cochas as well seeing this playlist <url>` (sorry, I put up that comment before actually finishing up for the night, and checked in here again) Good night Cha! Good Night everyone Andean music <url># Night Zem or not Zem, or Derp or even CB for all I know... maybe you feign being an adult hacker and a young student at the same time... It wasn't really ever clear whether or not I wasn't actually Epicderpguy as well to begin with... And on that note, I'm going to bed early tonight! ` I am not messing up the covers. Sliding in so as not to wrinkle all the sheets making sure the quilt stays nice and clean Have you ever seen a bed so neat? I'm getting intooo bed! ... sleepsleepsleeptimetogotosleepnow itisnightandineedtosleepwhileitisdark iamreallytiredtimeforsleep nowtiredtiredsleepsleepsleep I'm getting into bed! ` <url>"Cheetah Cub" Goodnight, "NOT Zem." ... Pleasant dreams. ... Uh, whoa, look at the time, I gotta go, um... not be a mattress! ^"Cheetah Cub" Well, it's getting late. I have to go hit the mattress. ... repeatedly. Mike, how about NOT Zem? It's shorter, but my real name. My legal name is NOT Zem Mattress. Junior. Reviving a mattress? Mattress Revival? That sounds like a really bad band name. He's only mostly dead, which means, slightly alive. To Miracle Max! Zem the Mattress may yet live to storm the castle! ^"Cheetah Cub" Da Schwartz is strong wit dis one. This is becoming infinitely more improbable ^"Cheetah Cub" I told you he would never consciously betray the rebellion. @The Commenter Formerly Known As A Mattress Do you have the droids I'm looking for? ^"Cheetah Cub" @Absolutely ... Your name is too long. Mind if I just call you @Zem? I mean, even go look at my account. The biography should explain it all. @100% NOT Zem .....you look familiar...and pillow topped... Which I am definitely not. For sure. I've never even heard of this Zem fellow. I swear! Stop looking at me like that! *Only applying to mattresses from Squorshelous Beta Mattress should be thoroughly dried before shipping. Thus their floopy attitude to life may not continue. I just thought it very interesting that for whatever reason you guys are lamenting a mattress. I mean, some of my best friends are mattresses, but I don't know how this one could make such an impression on you guys. ^"Cheetah Cub" What I'm getting at? Why, nothing. Nothing at all. I don't know what you're insinuating, C-... I mean Mike. And frankly I don't like that tone of voice. Text! You know what I mean. I don't know what you're getting at here... ^"Cheetah Cub" You seem overly concerned about a mere mattress, "NOT Zem." One might almost say ... too concerned. Wait, that's weird. Did someone's mattress just break down or something? Who grows so attached to a mattress they name it? Wow, sounds like I missed a cool person. Mattress. Whatever Zem was. ^"Cheetah Cub" Alert: We have a new Update about tomorrow's design session. ^"Cheetah Cub" Thanks @Aether. I missed being here. Hi Cb! You were missed during the day! +1 to a new card that makes reference to you or your tattoo. ^"Cheetah Cub" One of the cards should be the @Zem memorial mattress. ... out of respect. Some kind of mattress from what CB said. What's a Zem? lol ^"Cheetah Cub" @NZ, LOL Wow, who's this Zem guy? He sounds really interesting! I wish I could have gotten to know him before it was too late! Oh, must be some kind of fancy name brand thing then. ^"Cheetah Cub" Sleep number @Zem ^"Cheetah Cub" @Zem is a mattress. After all, you can't tell one from another, right? What are you talking about CB, who's Zem? I will too. ^"Cheetah Cub" I'm going to miss @Zem. Wait... what if CB IS anonymous?! Not actually anonymous persay, your name is right there, but that all of Anonymous is actually just you! It seems like a group of programming and computer science geniuses, but it's actually just you! ... uh oh, now you know I know, now nobody will ever find my online body! Physically, I'll still be here, but I'll never have existed online. ^"Cheetah Cub" So we have a tattooed hacker with a cheetah tail. ^"Cheetah Cub" How about just me with a Cheetah tail? ^"Cheetah Cub" Except I have no affiliation with Anonymous ... as far as you know. Or a cheetah with a tattoo of you! ^"Cheetah Cub" I'm conjuring up a picture of a Cheetah cub wearing an Anonymous mask ... ^"Cheetah Cub" Real hacking never gets people's attention. It's designed not to. Stuff like this: <url>"Cheetah Cub" Or the tattoo could be a cheetah. ^"Cheetah Cub" Tattooed Hacker Cheetah? ^"Cheetah Cub" @Quack, I Like! ^"Cheetah Cub" We would have to Hollywood that up though, because a picture of a keyboard would be really boring. Tattooed hacker ^"Cheetah Cub" How about something related to Insane Hacker Skills? Maybe an Oatmeal pictures of you with a cheetah butt hmmmm...... ^"Cheetah Cub" Except there's already a Cheetah Butt card in Exploding Kittens, so I don't think they would want to repeat that. Maybe a bear with a "cheetah butt" ? ^"Cheetah Cub" @Quack, that would be awesome. I'm honored and humbled. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Dr. P. My day was spent recovering from staying up all night watching election results. I've had better. Maybe a tribute in someway at least.... Your day go good @CB? CB I feel like you should be a card for being bad ass enough to get a BvB tattoo I don't want any hillary or trump stuff either, it'll just date the game. On top of other things. Well it was a busy day CB, it certainly was for me. I'm still here CB ^"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, your sleep/alertness chart doesn't work after age 60. It sucks to get old. ^"Cheetah Cub" Great. I finally get to post and everyone's gone. ^"Cheetah Cub" Sorry I missed the discussion of playing catch. Cappuccino loves chasing his tennis ball. I have to get him a new one every so often because he also loves chewing all the fuzz off of it. Beats chewing on me, which he also enjoys. ^"Cheetah Cub" What am I going to watch on TV now that the World Series and the election are both over? ^"Cheetah Cub" Wow, they still haven't posted the unlocked icon for the Art, even though we have achieved it. I'm kind of disappointed we didn't get the 1000 vodes one, especially since we got 1000 haikus su easily. At least we got two of the four election themed ones. I'm looking forward to seeing a Cthulu-Ducken soon. ^"Cheetah Cub" Morning cubs. Actually, it's evening, but I haven't been able to be on until now. I had to read through 120 comments! I definitely don't want any Trump/Clinton cards. If they ncluded them, I would probably just keep them in the box and substitute something else. Ah, Abbot and Costello, proving to my math and computer science major roommate why 7x28=13! Revolutionized his world. ... hooded like a hunting hawk & perched on ... some kind of robotic arm? WOW - @Cha's EK link - surely there's some inspiration on there for tomorrow too?! All those kittens... Also "traitorous duck" is an awesome concept. And can anybody come up with a character from those retriever cats/catch cats from earlier today? @GC I love the mental picture of your cat catching a toy and repeatedly dropping it back on you. Swap it for something more dangerous and you might have a weaponized retriever kitty... Sorry Dr. P I missed your comment but traitorous duck could be good I'll think about it and let you guys know Doesn't hurt to ask but I don't think they're doing any pop culture references Hulk Hogan baby Zem I know it's the one day! It was already decided no trump/Clinton cards Bear Grylls! I'm so bummed but I can't change this meeting. Thanks guys Woo! Livestream design sesh at a time when I can actually... no, DANG IT! I can't do it tomorrow of ALL possible days! Literally the one day I'm not available then!!! A trump baby and a Clinton bear could be interesting oh, DtQ not Zem. Wow the last few days have been just long.... Maybe.... a traitorous duck Zem? I'll try to pop on..... I will make sure to mention it @Quack :) Sigh I would suggest an evil duck card That's super awesome! I should actually be able to watch it! :D That's so awesome... But I have a meeting :-( Though some cats will play actual fetch, that is kind of rare. oooh I get it now Dr. P! now that's a game a dog wouldn't play haha. As long as the cat enjoys it, it should be fun for both sides haha Naps are like drugs. After trying one, you either never want it again or can't get enough. ` Haha, that's really funny, Dr. P! <url>#photo-1 The EKLOL Awards are given to any individual that passes 1k comments during the Exploding Kittens Kickstarter Campaign 2015.

Inductees as of 2015-02-23 17:29:16 UTC can be found on the <url>"Cthulu-Ducken" ? Good Night @GingerCub .. I have 4 and all with very distinct unique personalities and traits :) @Aether...we had a stake cookie award during the EK campaign it started simply enough and then morphed into quite the coccotion. :) have to find it This fuzzy ball may yet still morph into something grander and smellier ;) Hehe yup! Right, bed time for me. Catch you all tomorrow cubs! @Steff and Owen - you two have amazing cats! I love it. oooh I like that furry ball cha haha It is quite fun @Amanda, he sits at the top of his cat tower thing, I sit on the floor and throw a toy up to him, he catches it with his claws, gnaws on it for a bit, then drops it back down to me. We were doing that for ages! :) @Amanda: A friend of mine has a cat that played fetch. And would do so until you were tired from throwing his toy mouse down the hall for him to bring back to you. Congratulations @Aether *smiles* you deserved that 'k'. And are hereby awarded the appreciatetly growly soft fuzzy furry ball of 'Ok!!' Award!! I think it would be super fun to play catch with a cat. My in-laws dogs both don't play catch the "normal" way, so your cat just got their catching skills :P (One plays "catch" as in "I caught. Game done. It is called catch, not catchES," and the other just can't catch anything if her life depended on it) It's all gone quiet! Ooh awesome @Amanda! I'm playing catch with my cat, which is not something I thought would happen! Oh that's great @Amanda! You will make someone happy :) I was cutting my hair. (Chopped 12 inches off to donate!) Congrats Aether! whoops... :P My phone is a bit sticky now though... hahaha thanks!! haha I'm afraid I don't have any cookies *Throws ice cream at phone screen for @Aether* Hey! I want Ice cream too! haha achieving a certain number of comment should be worth at least a cookie... and yup, that's right chameleon <url>"Post comment" before them, if not, disregard this comment and it will auto destroy in 3...2...1...) Kaboom! Randy Crawford - Almaz <url># Mayer Hawthorne - Her Favorite Song <url># Although things are very quiet here today, maybe it will pass half an hour more until it is reached... I'll try not to push the next 8 haha great song Cha! The original is always good, although Muse's and Michael buble's versions are great too Looks like I came in at the right time! Who's it going to be... That would be crazy Aether.... crazy I tell you!!!! Yes, as things usually happen around here: Dr P will beat me and CB will beat Dr P, but maybe elan or ashley will pop in at the right moment Epicderpguy. He'll come back for the first time in a year just to whale up the 6,000th! Haha, it'll be so meta if the 6000th comment is wondering who will get it. My bet is on CB, he's going to come in at the last second and nab it when no one's looking. I don't comment very frequently lately, so it's unlikely to be me, though I'd be honored if I happen to randomly get it. Ooh, I could whip out my spamming skills to get us there faster! Who's going to get there first.... will it be Zem? Cha!?!... Probably not me...... I'm sorry I ever joked about making it into a competition. It became a meme now! A contest for the 6,000th is it?! Nina Simone - Feeling Good <url>™Sally :D Popping in to pass my admiration to @Aether on the video. That was stellar! I haven't been able to follow most of the postings but glad I saw that one - and kudos to the others getting the speeches out there too. How goes-ith it Zem? Dang it, I really can't find that bar graph! I love it, it's so perfect, but it's apparently not on the internet anymore! DID go* haha I have trouble with past auxiliary verbs Hi @Zem! yesterday I DID went to sleep haha, sorry that I couldn't stay up to make company for CB and you Zem that's a classic meme! Unfortunately I'm dragging today and I still have to go to work today. We did some a little while back @Justin, but we should be due for an official update here in a bit. We'll keep it to the top, and posted where people can find and see it. Hey, Chameleon! How you been? Also, good morning everyone. 3 hours of sleep here, but that weird paradox of after a point, less sleep being much better is kicking in, and I feel like I've had 8 hours. Which is even more funny because I average 6-7 most days, so after just 3 hours, I feel better than normal! ;) ` I couldn't find the original meme, a bar graph plotting awakeness against hours of sleep and it made a U shape, describing it perfectly, but this is pretty close. I spent the time from my last comment till now just searching for that original meme, but by golly, I won't rest until I can find it! <url>"Cheetah Cub" What a night. I didn't even hear the alarm this morning and I overslept by 2 1/2 hours. Thanks Aether :) Last night was just no good for speech writing or anthem writing. Might try again today, after I've had some coffee. Oooh awesome, nearly unlocked the art one then :) Well, let's try to make time to feel like it passes faster ;) I think people is already catching up with the other goals, according to my count we have 24 art pieces (1 to go) 14 provokes (11 to go) 3 bear bellies (22 to go) Wow, I didn't English there... *I'm good thanks @Aether - dark and early morning here still. We'll see how the day goes, but right now I'm not up to doing much of anything. I good thanks @Aether :) Yup, it's nearly 3:30pm here, an hour and a half till home time ;) Hello Amanda!! :) ready to keep posting and unlocking?? ;) Thanks @GC!! :D I'm glad you liked it :) I'm fine how are you? It's already afternoon over there, right? Morning @Amanda! How are you today? Morning Aether, Ginger, and others. Morning @Aether! How are you? I love your frightened bear song btw! Morning! How expensive is day care there, and travel since it isn't full day? To be fair out taxes are high but it's very frustrating we're one of only 3 towns in the state without it My local election voted down full day kindergarten(again) despite the studies that show vast benefits of it. Because they don't want to pay higher taxes. It goes How goes it DtQ? Morning Dr.P Excellent! It's never too early for the joy of Christmas. I'm pretty good thank you, listening to Christmas songs, it's not too early right... ;) How about yourself this day GC? All is well enough. Oops, apologies, I didn't mean to shout at you! Morning @Dr. P, HOW ARE YOU TODAY? Mornin' everyone! I don't think we did, but I'd be happy to be proven wrong! I might give it a go, could be worth a shot. Hehe, that's okay, even seeing the word sunny brightened up my day (even though it's not sunny here) ;) Yeah, me too I'm certain will get to 75k backers Sorry if I supposed to say "don't know" not "sunny know" I sunny know Steph I suppose you could try I wonder if we got the 1,000 voters Morning @Dave! Excellent! I would love to contribute to the baby based pictures, but I don't have one, nor do I know anyone with one. Maybe I could buy a baby doll, do you think that would count? ;) I'm going to really try and get a provoke picture today Morning folks Lets just hope we can get a few more stretch goals done today :) We can do it team! Morning @James. That sounds like a good plan @Geist! @Ginger Cub: I'll get over it. Just have to drink a lot more booze for the next 4 years 'morning all. Morning @Geist! I'm good thank you, how are you (disregarding certain events ;))? Hello Ginger Cub. I'm on my way to work. Sober. How are you doing? It's very lonely here *sniff* *sniff* Hellooo? {Hellooo} {Helloo} {Hello} *Echos* Any cubs awake out there? :) Sorry, it's not that, and this should have been on the other board, but it led to a succession of thoughts that made me realize exactly how stressed I am because of Thursday. I never notice how bad it is for me until something snaps everything into place and I end up staring at a wall for 20 minutes before realizing I'll get at best 3 hours of sleep now before a long day before an important one. Sorry, not my place to make it your problem, nor especially your fault. Yeah, that helped for sure. I try and use comedy because it's the single defense against severe stress I have, and it's instantly rebuffed. That's sure to help me sleep. 3 am on a tuesday night... can't wait to make major life decisions later this week on no sleep. ^"Cheetah Cub" Good night, @Zem. I'll see you tomorrow. Safe to say I let that get to me a bit more than I should have. I won't be going to bed for another hour because of homework. Fine... ` I am not messing up the covers. Sliding in so as not to wrinkle all the sheets making sure the quilt stays nice and clean Have you ever seen a bed so neat? I'm getting intooo bed! ... sleepsleepsleeptimetogotosleepnow itisnightandineedtosleepwhileitisdark iamreallytiredtimeforsleep nowtiredtiredsleepsleepsleep I'm getting into bed! ` <url>` huzzah for first elections. i'm a big boy now. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, please sing the sleep song and call it a night. It isn't funny. I'm sorry, CB, I'm so incredibly stressed from this and other things happening in my life, I had to wait until most everyone was gone to be able to vent. ` To make it up, another roommate just said something too beautiful in the next room to a friend. ` "If Trump replaces Obama, does that mean orange is the new black?" I love that everywhere I look in my apartment, there are bear pictures and #bearsvsbabies signs. ^"Cheetah Cub" Great, now @Zem is lurking. Just when I thought I was safe from politics ... Sounds like me and actual work! I mean, not at 1:00, but at 23:00, but same difference basically, when you wake up at 4:00. Time for homework! 1:17 am, no time like the present! Yeah, it's over, Bill is sweeping up the confetti and balloons, finishing off any wine left in glasses. No more even about the election until tomorrow. I'm done. It's over. Well, except for the riots, accusations, bickering... but for tonight, no more. ;) Thinking about speeches/anthems for tomorrow. Didn't get a chance to help my guys write any today. Nope! I've just been lurking it out. I'm eating mass quantities of chocolate. ^"Cheetah Cub" Wow, fresh blood. How you doing, @Amanda? I hope you don't want to talk about politics. You're gonna have to work a lot harder to hide the political stuff :P I wonder how many other lurkers have been around too. Hoping for good BVB news in the morning. ^"Cheetah Cub" Wow, they're even sending people home in New York! I thought that city never slept! ^"Cheetah Cub" Actually, I enjoy the company, so you can pretty much talk about anything you want. Who's going to stop you? Not me. ^"Cheetah Cub" Well it's going to take ten more days here. Yeah, I tried to keep the politics off, and did pretty well until the stress finally got to me, but I held it until everyone was gone but the one lonely guy left... (sorry, it's just a funny mental picture) Now I want to bury it so it doesn't start something here, especially since I know I'm in the minority on here. Thanks for hearing me out, I just want to talk about the facts, but so many districts are on hold for some reason. My roommate went to bed, I think, so this is my only place to get the extreme stress of the past week (and week to come, so much happening for me right now, so much changing) out. ^"Cheetah Cub" Yeah. The polls didn't close there until 1AM Eastern. I don't know. Is Alaska finally tallying? Took them long enough! What irks me is all the places that are incredibly close, but still have like 10% of the districts left! GET ON THIS! You have one job, and it could change everything! It's the priority of the entire nation right now! Stop slacking, you've been still for hours now! ^"Cheetah Cub" You may have noticed that I'm just letting you rant. I really have no desire to discuss the politics of this election here. ^"Cheetah Cub" The only numbers that are changing are Alaska. Did all of the people counting go to bed or something? I feel like it was finally safe to say something like that, though, because it's just you and me, CB, and everyone else went to bed, so this might be buried by tomorrow. Hangovers all around! Nobody's probably going to want to read the comments after this fiasco. Sorry. I know I'm breaking my own rules, but I have to say it. I'm moreso in the "Better him than her" category, but even so... Jesus Christ, a man who was a meme and a joke for 20 years just got elected president. That's like how so many jokes lost a punchline when the Cubs won! It's really... I still have NO idea what I feel! ` Okay, so, SO very sorry! I failed myself. No more about this unless prompted. Into the doghouse. ^"Cheetah Cub" Well, if you want to know how I voted, you can just scroll down. I don't want to talk about that right now though. I just want to know who won the damn thing. I'd say it'd come down to a recount in like Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, but the projections say Trumpy has it in just enough places to have the minimum for outright majority. Get your vodka, everyone, Trumpistan is here. (not to say my affiliations, though, because) ... I have no idea what to feel about this election. I personally didn't care one way or the other and just wanted it done. Now that it looks like we know who'll win, I still have no idea what I feel. I feel like I would complain either way, but at least now I can joke around for either person and outcome. ^"Cheetah Cub" It's like waiting for water to boil. You stay up half the night with toothpicks holding your eyes open until you fall asleep from exhaustion, then you get up the next morning and it's all done and you missed it. But really though. My Poli-sci 101 teacher got experience from Mexico (he's from Mexico City), and he worked for the party he didn't support the first time he worked in politics. When the party lost, he was like someone trying desperately not to laugh, and his boss noticed and came over and said "You should probably go in the stairwell." (he knew his affiliations) He went in there and started yelling and called his brother, but the dejection of everyone there left an impact on him for life, to see the soul-crushingness of close, nail-biting defeat, especially in a party that had been there for decades. ^"Cheetah Cub" I feel like that one guy. ^"Cheetah Cub" None of the numbers have changed for the last hour or 2. Why does it take 1 hour to count 97% of the vote and then another six hours to count the other 3%? I never did understand that. You wanna know something? I've always wondered what it's like in the parties held by candidates on election night. All the stress is over, just sit back and watch helplessly. Especially for nail-bitingly-close ones such as this. But even moreso... I've always wanted to see the losing candidate's party after they find out they lose, especially when it's this too-close-for-comfort the entire time. It's like a really, really close sports game that goes to the last seconds when one could throw a hail-mary and change everything. What's it like there? I just imagine, when all is said and done and the official results come out, that it's like most parties at 5 am, when there's just the one guy that refuses to leave until all the wine is gone, balloons sagging on the floor, people passed out drunk, just some lonely guy sweeping the floor, picking up bottles... Dang, I watch too much tv! ;) ^"Cheetah Cub" If this pace keeps up, I'm going to have to go out and get a Monster Ultra Black. ^"Cheetah Cub" Geez, I hope they don't find any hanging chads! ^"Cheetah Cub" Close race for Governor, thousands of "provisional" ba;;ots (whatever that is) and one side already claiming victory. Sounds like Bush vs Gore all over again. :-( ^"Cheetah Cub" 9gag? Sounds like something I don't want to know about. How do you mean, CB? I know a few states are going to have to have recounts because they're within a percentage as of this point. They'll be back and forth for a few days for sure. Yeah, safe to say I'm quitting 9gag after this election. Especially if Trumpy wins because JESUS is 9gag going to turn violently anti-american! Even more anti-American, I mean. It's already the most toxic community I've seen in my ample experience on the internet. I've been thinking of stopping going there for months, but after this election, it's going to get ugly. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, you should be in North Carolina. It looks like it won't be over here for another 10 days. ^"Cheetah Cub" I finally kenneled the dog because he was having a hard time staying awake with me. It seems like election results came to a halt, and it's driving me crazy. I don't care who wins, I just want it to be over. Then again, regardless of who wins, there's going to be a sh**fest for the next 3-6 months just about how people hated this election and general griping and complaining. ^"Cheetah Cub" I'm still up, @Zem Just watching noyhing in particular on TV Are you, Aether? Are you really? I don't know how you could sleep. All this commotion and no... lullaby... I need sleeps too, good night every one. It looks like I have a nice playlist for tomorrow! as always, thanks for it Cha! I'm off to bed, G'night everybody! Natasha Befingfield - Wild Horses <url># Lilly Allen - Everything's Just Wonderful <url># Nelly Furtado - Turn Off The Light <url># ^"Cheetah Cub" Dang! I'm awake, but I have the sound turned down so I can'y listen to any of this! Steaming Satellites - Spaceships <url># Ellie Goulding - Beating Heart <url># Damien Rice - Delicate <url>"Cheetah Cub" There, that felt better. Thanks @Aether. New unofficial totals are up. <url>"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, you're missing the obvious again. Ask Elan for help. Well, that was my roommate. But between he, me, and another friend, especially that other friend, we could definitely come up with a game. None of us could produce or market it, though. ^"Cheetah Cub" See, you CAN do it, @Zem. Ah, you RUN the tavern, DUH! Why was that so hard for me to think up?! That's the game! My roommate thought that was a given, but I hadn't even considered it! ^"Cheetah Cub" Ugh! A game designed by committee? Say it ain't so. I'd love to make the rules for "Brewers & Barmaids", but I have no clue what the game would even be about. This could be a Crew Project! ^"Cheetah Cub" I wish she would have at least told us that there was nothing to report. ^"Cheetah Cub" I guess Ashley "forgot" to post the afternoon counts. It's after 8PM Pacific time. I'm disappointed. Now I have to stay here in the comments section instead of updating the CubSub site. Jeez, don't put words in my mouth! Or take important ones out! I don't want a political hellfire here, but talking about the results, the facts, is perfectly fine! I mentioned that from the start! @Aether What elections? ;-) Thanks Zem! =D Maybe it was about how 'not' to talk about elections? haha I've noticed that you brought up that a lot in the past hours hahaha I'm in Zem Yeah, Aether, that was really good pronunciation actually. And the best video so far, I think! ` I came here to say something, but I've forgotten what it was. If any of you remembers what it was, don't hesitate to remind me. Disappointing I have only seen 2 bears in voting locations :/ ^"Cheetah Cub" @Aether, your pronunciation is adorable, especially pomeranians. ^"Cheetah Cub" Also, I want to be a playtester. :) :) :) Thanks everybody! I'm glad you all like it, including the touch of the CubSub, it took me two days of work but this campaign deserves it, not just for the game but for the new e-friendships too! And yes, Spanish is my main language so my pronunciation isn't that good haha ^"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, all you have to do is come up with the rules. Aether that was stellar No problem if you can't laugh at yourself especially for suggesting so silly you're too uptight That actually sounds like a good game. Like Boss Monster, making fun of tabletop RPGs, which always start in an inn someplace. Could be setting up an adventure or something! Dang, this could be a really good game! I want it to be real! ^"Cheetah Cub" Ooh, I almost forgot. Great use of the CubSub, @aether! ^"Cheetah Cub" Next campaign: Brewers vs Barmaids When i went at 7 Am, there were no brewers at my polling place sadly ^"Cheetah Cub" Thanks for having a sense of humor. ;-) I should really proofread more carefully Stupid swipe typing ^"Cheetah Cub" I think people were afraid they'd get arrested if they showed up at the polls in a brewer's costume. Brewers? I don't know, but their beer would probably have been much appreciated, I'm sure. ;) I didn't get to pay much attention during the day did we get many brewers at polling stations? Cha!, he's said he's from Mexico, so Spanish. ` Also, yeah, sorry I didn't watch that before, but it's incredible! You're awesome, Aether! @Aether...what's your mother tongue? I love how you say burrs :) @Aether...whoaeoweoot!! That's AMAZING!! LOVE IT!! ^"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, there are no coastal states. There is no middle. There are only bears. ... and babies. That said, we all know both coasts are primarily democrat and the entire middle is primarily republican, so the midwest chiming in changes nothing until the west says something. I just thought it was interesting is all. Oh dang, I just checked again, and it was really close until most of the midwest chimed in! Then again, not sure how projection works, and when we know the official results. It's about 24 hours, right? ` And don't give me crap, I said NON-POLITICAL, but factual discussion I would like to have. Non-opinionated, but it'd be nice to talk about the results, like "Wow, this key state seems like it'll do this, that's unexpected!" or something like that. I just don't want a flame war is all. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Aether, wow ... just ... WOW! I know that right now there's only one thing in our minds, (myself included) but I wanted to share with you all the Frightened Bear song, hope you enjoy it, lyrics are on the description because english is not my mother's tongue: <url>"Cheetah Cub" People are still posting written speeches instead of video speeches. I have added two more at www.cubsubcorps.com/SpeechScripts.html ^"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, I could donate a smart phone, but I can't pay for your data plan. CB, then you know what it's like. ... ... ... (donations are appreciated) ;) Good luck with that Zem ^"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, you sound exactly like me during my college years. I would be at the forefront of technology if I had the money. That's why I'm still banking on the Corps Lottery Deal of 2015. ;) ^"Cheetah Cub" I can remember when I was in college I wanted a Sinclair Z80 but I could never scrape together $100 to buy one. ^"Cheetah Cub" The dot is my second Echo. I have the big one on my livivg room. CB I also love tech though my budget is tight or if have more things like the echo ^"Cheetah Cub" @Dr, P. You can pick a script from <url>"Cheetah Cub" My most recent acquisition was an amazon Echo Dot, which replaced my iPhone as my alarm clock and extends home automation to my bedroom. ^"Cheetah Cub" Well, as everyone can tell, I embrace technology. I have done so ever since high school in the early 1970's. I wanted a tablet 15 years before the original iPad, and yes, I preordered one so I could have it on Day 1. Amanda I remember thinking when u first got a regular cell "Why do I need this?" And then thought I would rarely at best use a smart phone. Now like everyone else I'd go nuts without it. Though there's always a special place in my heart for my Razr! I haven't written a speech, one of the complications in the first place. But sure, go ahead. Actually, if you want, you can come up with one from my point of view or something. ;) Not sure how that'd work, or what mattresses have to say on the matter, but there you are. Mind if I enact your speech Zem? Thinking about trying when I have time. CB, I guess, but it'd really end up being more of a pain than it's worth any way I can see it. I only don't have a smartphone because money. My parents bought me this phone several years ago, and I'm on their plan, so I'd have to pay extra to get my own, and it's just alot of money I don't have. So busy. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, do you have any videographer friends? I had always wanted one, but always had a flip phone. Then, when smartphones were commonplace (circa 2011) I got a slider phone. I've tried smartphones (and have one for work) but give me a slider any day. But then, I call and text a LOT, and don't really use data at all, and have no desire to. ^"Cheetah Cub" Ewwwwwww! I didn't like slider phones even when they were in style! For the record, my go-to phone during that era was a Blackberry. @Zem - you and I have almost the same phone! Yeah, I used my laptop for my recordings (all of them) Hmm? Oh, I didn't see that question. Earlier, there were tons of comments flying and I wasn't checking often, so I missed it. Nah, I don't have a way to record anything like that. For reference, here's my phone: <url>"Cheetah Cub" Pleeeeeeeeeeze! ^"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, I never got an answer from you. Are you going to do a speech on YouTube? Hey, it was just a funny thought that this is like... that club that shall not be named! @Mike Kabala, Thanks - missed it originally. :) ^"Cheetah Cub" @SilencedScream, The upgrade is described in detail in Update 4: <url>"Cheetah Cub" ... for what @GM said. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, +1 for what @GN said. ^"Cheetah Cub" Thanks @Aether. New totals are posted. www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html @Zem: You're the one bringing it up the most...might be a good idea to forget about it since we are trying not to even think about it. Haha, I want the elections to be like... you know what. First rule of the elections: You do not talk about the elections. Second rule of the elections: You do NOT talk about the elections. (at least not in an overly-political manner, just here on BvB) Clayton, 25 photos of wearing a Bears vs Babies costume at a voting location. Am i missing something? Where is this goal at? "2 bears in location (23 to go) " 2 bears in location (23 to go) 13 provokes (12 to go) 5 speeches/anthems (20 to go) around 285 vote pics Thanks @CB your hard work is really appreciated, let's hope some backers use the speeches. I have been working on my art piece since yesterday morning... I would love to dedicate a full week for it but I must keep my attention in another important matter. I think I will finish it today though. ^"Cheetah Cub" People who take selfies in the mirror need to learn how to flip the photo so it doesn't read backwards. Thanks for voting though. I don't think they'l disqualify you for posting a backward hashtag/sticker. Lissie - Don't You Give Up On Me <url>"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, YouTube? Watching or uploading? A rousing speech, perhaps? ??? ^"Cheetah Cub" Thanks @!C, I've added that article to the press page. I'll bet most people didn't even know we HAD a press page, but we do. Alert Alert Alert #talkingaboutsomethingyoudontwannatalkabout :) Too finger fast... Dont't use the mattress, be Zem the Mattress!! :) Just to repeat, I'm starting a sub-sub-corps of political peace. As little politics as possible here except for maybe talking about who won and by how much, but no making that a rant. #LetsKeepBvBSafe @Zem..you snooze, you loose ;) Don't use the mattress, be Zen the mattress!! A youtube video and I miss 24 comments? Wow, this is getting out of hand! These guys wrote an interesting article about BvB and gamifying Kickstarter campaigns. Elan liked it :) <url>"Cheetah Cub" @Dr.P. Just write "I Voted" right under the hashtag and stand at the polling place past the line where you can't campaign for any candidate. lol this is true @Dr.P...print and cut one out, slap it on your chest, take selfie :) Good, still need to figure out how I'm to do my own photo voter submission since they didn't have any stickers. We only need 5 more art pieces!!...anyone here not submitted anything? ^"Cheetah Cub" @!C, LOL. Hahaha Rod Stewart - I Don't Want To Talk About It <url>#talkingaboutsomethingyoudontwannatalkabout How is everyone today? They should GM, even if they don't.... which is a real shame. Yay!! @CupCake :) @Quack...ha I just had a flashback looking closely at your pumpkin submission pic #Update9 ;) Posted my vote picture! @CB: "Unbiased" and coverage do not go hand in hand. ^"Cheetah Cub" @GM, I will probably watch the election returns, but I may have to flip around quite a bit to find coverage that doesn't annoy the heck out of me with its "unbiased" coverage. Heck, I may leave the sound off all night and watch the pretty pictures. @CB: I'm going to go home, ignore the TV(aside from the video game I will have open and be playing), ignore the radio(I never listen to it anyways, I always play music from my iPod), and avoid any mentions of the elections since the season finale is almost over with...well, part 1. There is always part 2 of "But so and so cheated!" or anything along those lines, where I will promptly throat punch anyone who is within reach. @Quack...that reminded me of Nick Cave & Kylie Minogue - Where The Wild Roses Grow <url>"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, I'm with you. I have the sound turned down on the TV and I'm going to keep it down until I decide I want to watch election coverage. That way I won't be inundated with negative attack ads after I've already voted. I even turned my radio down on my way to the polls so I wouldn't have to hear any commercials there. This KickStarter is a relatively safe haven on Election Day. ^"Cheetah Cub" Here's that list of scripts again with labels and without those annoying iframes: <url>"all of this" as you called it Oh hey, I've got an idea for a pact. No matter what, let's not talk about the election here! This is one of the few even near-safe-havens on the internet, and I don't want it to be corrupted and blown out of the sky by this. I don't want super political arguments to spew forth on here as well. It's an election day Zem, it was ultimately unavoidable! Zem of course you can't How about Toadies - Possum Kingdom <url>"Cheetah Cub" Here's all the scripts I could find in need of a video: <url>#represent them in a video with their permission (with citation!). Good work everyone. We're getting closer on a couple. Only six more artworks needed Queen - We Are The Champions <url># Good music choice Cha! Excellent ginger cub! afternoon picker upper REM - Shiny Happy People <url>"Cheetah Cub" Just hunted down that anthem and watched it. At this rate, we'll reach the "Rousing" challenge within a few days! Thank you! :) I also like your speech! Thanks Aether - I wanted something more rousing than just my awkward face :P Aww thank you @Aether! :) @GB! Great job!! I know you said that you don't like your voice but I think is great! It has a tone of leadership =) @Amanda your anthem is pretty cool too! with the banner on the video, it really got me in the mood. Aww thank you @CB! :) Love the anthem @Amanda :) ^"Cheetah Cub" Bravo, @GC. You had nothing to worry about. <url>#represent them in a video with their permission (with citation!). Also... I didn't know what was a cthulu ducken, so in case someone feels brave to do that one but doesn't know what is that too, here's the description of it: <url>"Cheetah Cub" Actually, there were three Ptero-Babies, but we only needed one. @Dr. P this is my favorite drone: <url>™'s request -- that had to be EPIC. At least it is in my dreams.... PS: I missed out on Ptero-Baby! Someone post it here! Wow, already up to over 200 votes?? Glad I got mine in early: <url>"Cheetah Cub" New official counts: <url>#represent them in a video with their permission (with citation!). Thanks @Ashley! Is it worth posting an update or something saying that the speeches need to be recorded? People who aren't on the comments all day might not know that Hi everyone! Here is your early update. 7 baby tank, 14 pumpkins, 16 beard babies, 19 art, 12 provokes, 201 votes, 1 ptero baby, 1 person dressed in bvb at voting, 2 pregnant belly bear, 3 rousing speech. You have unlocked ptero baby flown by a drone, and over 100 vote pictures. Congratulations! As always we use our own discretion to accept entries based on quality and do not accept multiple entries in the same category by an individual. If you have any questions you can email <email> @CB that's strange, I will check the video preferences ;) @Clayton you're welcome, it's a collective work though, CB updating the page is also hard work and Cha addressing backers' doubts, as well as Dr. P, GM, and all the backers that post pictures ;) there are more things than just nationality when it comes to making bonds and relationships (sorry to bring that up again but I find it awesome how we all work together for the same (stretch) goal here in BvB) ;) Only saw that after I voted. :( Not allowed in NJ so. Different states different rules. I just saw an article on what is allowed and not allowed and apparently you can take a selfie in the voting booth in PA. Just have to post it afterwards. @Tom: The core deck gets the card, the NSFW gets the condom, the combo pack gets both. I was thinking about the 50 bears photo, would it count if someone took a photo at a Chicago Bears game with a hashtag note? In Canada, so I'm just brainstorming this one Elan posted a vote pic on Twitter!! you need to add something to the non-nsfw box so they arent left out. nsfw gets condom and card core gets just the card. add something for them ^"Cheetah Cub" Yeah, and @Ashley too! Don't go forgetting @Ashley, @CB ^"Cheetah Cub" @Elan, you know what would be really cool? If you posted a photo showing that you voted today. Same goes for "The Oatmeal." There weren't any stickers where I voted either.... debating how to get a good pic for submission without one. My voting place is rather non-descript and I didn't have time to let the line build before work, and voting will be done by the time I can get back that way. Thanks Elan you're pretty outstanding yourself! The last at my polling station said lots of people were asking for stickers this year(we don't have them apparently). That was at like 7AM...I wonder if there's more BvB backers in my neighborhood @Aether tower Just wanted to say thanks for keeping the unofficial counts. I doubt it is easy to do having to search all social media outlets Same with @Ashley for doing the official counts for the same reasons... @GM Noted and agree. However, still no need for name calling. trust me. i am saddened that this is the best we could get out of our total population to run to lead our country. Probably going to have to wait until tomorrow Hi Dave! Hope your pumpkins count, and hope your baby sleeps more soon! ^"Cheetah Cub" @Aether, oh that's right. Yours doesn't show up in my YouTube search, but I remember seeing it. My art stinks but I did what I could. My baby keeps waking up before I can provoke her! Hey Dave! I just submitted a pumpkin picture <url>"Cheetah Cub" It's great to see all of the diversity in the voting photos! Got a picture provoking a baby this morning, just need to get home to unload and send it in! ^"Cheetah Cub" Still only two speech videos? Come on, people, we have 23 more to go! Fingers crossed @Amanda! @Ginger/Ryan - That's what I'm thinking. Was hoping maybe Ashley would confirm if that works when the morning/afternoon update rolls around. ^"Cheetah Cub" We have another BvB themed song. <url>"Cheetah Cub" It's been fun carrying my handwritten hashtag around. The only place I didn't take it was the tattoo parlor, so I had to make another one there. If I was in America I would vote ;) @Amanda, I agree with @Ryan, that's your polling place, so it should count... theoretically. @Amanda A I say go to a drop box in costume and take a picture. That is your polling place. If my state had polling places, I'd be happy to go to one in costume. But alas, all we have are drop boxes. I apologize for my previous indiscretion, I wholly support everyone's right to vote, and as an international backer I support my American friends on their election night. @Clayton Smith: you make good points, and I recognize it's a general comment. Again, sorry for inadvertently raising an argument. @Clayton: Only rebuttal I will give regarding your rant, is that we don't have to be citizens of whatever country to have an opinion. That's the thing about opinions, they are just that, an opinion. You can take it, or leave it. But do NOT try and squash people from free thinking. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Dr.P. I would be happy to comply. Let's try not to use this space for political opinions. It can end in a heated discussion, as international friends we also have strong opinions and I would like to think that everyone here can respect the point of view of everyone else. @CD lol. Please note: this is NOT directed at @Shawn Fuhrer Start Rant i do love how non American Citizenship folks are out trying to sway voters. if you felt that strongly about it, why not become a US citizen...oh wait, that's right. you are in this country illegally. And why the name calling? sure you may not like a candidate, but guess what. If your not a citizen or not even in this country, you don't get a say in the matter. Or at least not one I will listen to. if you want to have a say, then move to the US legally, become a citizen and then tell me your thoughts. rant over ^"Cheetah Cub" @Shawn, on that we can both agree. It's 59F (15C) here in Charlotte, NC right now, but the forecast high is 70F (21C) Let's keep the politics out of the comment section, people will vote as they choose for their own reasons. It is no ones business who votes for who, or why. The important thing is that they fulfill their civic right and duty, nothing more. <url>"Cheetah Cub" @Shawn Fuhrer, I didn't vote for that orange baked squinty idiot monster who may in fact be the second coming of Hitler. I did, however, vote for Donald J. Trump. Good luck on the election tonight America, from a frozen friend from the north (although our forecast is for a high of 20C (68F)) Please don't vote for that orange baked squinty idiot monster who may in fact be the second coming of Hitler. ^"Cheetah Cub" That brings our unofficial total to 30 achievements. www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html ^"Cheetah Cub" I just voted and posted my photo to Facebook. @CB we have around 148 vote pics so we should have unlocked the 100 votes achievement already. Also I have only seen 1 pic of a bear in a voting location... we really need more of those because we have limited time to accomplish that one Two more voting pics, my girlfriend and I both posted from our separate accounts after we voted One voting pic added to FB. Hopefully another one of a polling place later � Alright, I got out and voted, and posted the picture to twitter! One more for the tally! @CB I voted this morning, but now I have to go to a meeting. then i can take my selfie and post it. They didn't have any voting stickers when I went to vote this morning :*(, I'll have to make myself a crown later..... ^"Cheetah Cub" I hope the reason I'm the only one spamming the comments today is because everyone else is out voting. I have a meeting at work, then I will be going out to cast my vote. ^"Cheetah Cub" A baby with a white beard ... Reminds me of a song ... <url>"Cheetah Cub" @Joe Walters, in order to count in both categories, they need to be two separate photos. No reason not to take both of them at the same time, though. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Ryan Orr, lol. Yes, I'd definitely ask the parent for permission before provoking their child. The achievement isn't actually to provoke the baby though. All you have to do is capture the moment BEFORE the baby is actually provoked. Good luck. white beard*** i have a month old baby... i should take pictures of her... i could put a little while beard on her and take a picture, then have her manager come by and get a pic of her too... looks the same, but has a goatee on top of the beard (shrug)... can i provoke her with the beard and two bird this mamajama? @Mike I'd love to, but I gotta find a baby lol. My family doesn't live close and I sure as heck can't get arrested for provoking someone else's child lol Good Morning CubSubians :) Voted and submitted!! ^"Cheetah Cub" @Ryan Orr, I'm glad you agree that provokong a baby is easy. I'll be looking forward to seeing your entry in this category. Mornings, my least favorite part about waking up. And that's saying something considering waking up also keeps me from my favorite, sleep. It seems the provoke one is really easy, I'm amazed that one isn't completed yet. If I had a baby I could pretend to provoke I'd send that one in for sure. I posted a voting picture but I don't have a sticker or anything I don't know if it will count � ^Not official count, just my guestimate. The official counts may be found on this page. <url>"Nope, it just makes it so the experience for those 2 to 4 players is even more horribly offensive and awesome." with the NSFW expansion with the extra cards can you play this with 5 players? @Ginger Cub - I know the feeling - doing something for a stretch goal and finding out it was a waste of time is annoying. I just couldn't get into writing one last night after I already did six songs, then retroactively got told only a couple would count, then later got told only one would count (if all six were counted, we'd have that goal now). Tried to get my friends in on it too, but none of their artworks got counted because of the quality thing (again, that'd be 2-3 more). Hopefully inspiration will hit again when tomorrow is really here (I don't count 4am as "here" yet, especially on two hours sleep). @Amanda that would be horrible! I'm thinking I may have to do a video of my speech, but I'm not exactly looking forward to that. Don't want it to have been a waste of time writing it! I just woke up from a nightmare that they had added (to the "no multi-submissions of the same thing" led to "can limit number from people if we want" led to "one per person" ; "quality matters for art" ; "need a video for speeches" etc.) another new rule that if you commented on this page, you couldn't submit an entry for the stretch goals, and we lost several goals retroactively because of it. Glad that was just a dream. It's showing as unlocked on their site :) <url>` <url>~ Carmina Burana <url>"Cheetah Cub" I just had an idea that may help us achieve the Battle Speech achievement sooner. Several of us have posted excellent scripts online, but the BvB team appear to prefer videos to scripts. Therefore, I urge those of you who have posted scripts to make a video of someone reading the script. Some of those people may yet be unaware of the video (requirement?} Therefore, I also suggest those of you with eloquent speaking voices and/or good videographer skills to take one of the scripts yourselves and produce a video we all can be proud of. It's cooperative effort at its finest. Wow, the first goal was so slow, but now we're blasting through all of them! With 9 full days left to go! ^"Cheetah Cub" So far, I'm counting 3 speeches, all by Crew Members. ^"Cheetah Cub" That'll put us at 29 of 35 after it's confirmed. Thanks @CB :) ^"Cheetah Cub" @Aether, I just watched one of them. Looks good to me, too. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Aether Tower, very creative! I like the way you transitioned from the script to the baby voice video. Babybabble!! I like that haha Thanks @Zem @CB there are 3 ptero babies on drones flying around. 1 of them is really really good. So I think we already unlocked that one unofficially Good job on interpreting that from the unintelligible babybabble, Aether! That's awesome though! So, the Crawfish Mcthudersquish managed to intercept this message from the baby army: <url>"Cheetah Cub" ((( groan ))) I was hoping we could avoid politics here. ((( s i g h ))) ^"Cheetah Cub" New totals are up. www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html I uploaded to YouTube yay! Here it is in writing, shamelessly plagiarized from the Donald. ;) Speech "Grab Em By Da Nappy." We will make Honey beart again! We can never be too beart! The beauty of us is that we're very beart! We will make Honey beart again! We like thinking big. If we're going to be thinking anything, we might as well think big beary things. We will build a great wall – and nobody builds walls better than us, believe us – and we’ll build them very inexpensively. We will build a great, great wall all around us, and we will make the Babies pay for that wall. Mark our words. You know, it really doesn’t matter what Elan writes & Matthew draws as long as we’ve got a young and bearyful piece of ass. We shall not be overcomb by Babies! Grab Em By Da Nappy!! I'm a huge fan of your speech! haha This challenge will be fun ^"Cheetah Cub" OK, I guess they are looking for video speeches. Here's mine. <url>"Grab Em By Da Nappy." We will make [country, thing, food] beary again! We can never be too beary! The beauty of us is that we're very beary! We will make [insert country, thing, food] beart again! We will build a great wall – and nobody builds walls better than us, believe us – and we’ll build them very inexpensively. We will build a great, great wall all around us, and we will make the Babies pay for that wall. Mark our words. You know, it really doesn’t matter what the Elan & Mathew write as long as we’ve got a young, and bearyful, piece of ass.” We like thinking big. If we're going to be thinking anything, we might as well think big beary things. We shall not be overcomb by Babies! Grab Em By Da Nappy! Sleep well! My task now is sleep! Night all! I agree. I need to write one, and maybe I can get my guys to do some as well. That's a later-tonight task though. That would be cool! Don't think I'd be very good at it though ;) thanks @cha! I just read the speech from @CB and it is awesome too!! It would be awesome to have those speeches perfomed as @Ashley said Amazing! (I didn't mean to rush you, I'm just overly excited) Hey guys I'm working on your count now. The speeches are amazing. It would be beary cool if we could see some videos of those performed. *refreshes eagerly at exactly 4:30 (16:30) Pacific time because I should be doing adulting right now, but care much more about our updates for BvB* I have canned dragon meat in my cabinet I do love dragons even if they are part of the evil baby army... :) Thank you @Amanda @Cha! - I love it! Thank you @GingerCub... I hadn't submitted an art piece yet. Hope they like it :) @Aether...awesome Baby sprach!! Awesome @Cha!! More ptero! @agentmousey94 Because there is a secret in humanity that is not revealed until a person is 35 years old... jk, I think it is intended to mark that it's for adults only. I think we are still short on the art submissions..yes? I created a Drag-on Baby :) <url>"Cheetah Cub" I kept watching it over and over again expecting something different to happen. Then finally, I realized it was a loop. That's what usually happens when I try to fly a drone. <url>"fly it around" ?? Hilarious! @GC, I just read your speech too - well done. And hey, did Elan forget his hashtag or am I missing something....? Sod it, done a battle speech lol. Omg @Aether I just saw that too, I literally bursted out laughing, brilliant! hahahahahaha I just saw the attempt to fly around a ptero baby! jajaja it is really funny and unexpected Hmm, need to think of a battle speech... Well that's lunchtime tomorrow sorted... ;) ^This is true mainly for submission involving staged photos or videos, of course. Challenges created purely in an image editor , for certain challenges are exempt, of course, as well non-image submissions. There, that should convincingly confuse everyone *sticks paw in mouth and sits in the corner* ^If you've submitted something without it, resubmit it if you can, with the written hashtag. Doevers are good. :) Gots to have the #BearsVsBabies hashtag written and intelligable on a physical object in the photo image, like a sheet of paper or an index card, or whatever, as long as it's clear that it's an object in the actual image and not something phot-shopped on the image. ^"Cheetah Cub" OK guys, that gives us about three hours to blow some more achievements out of the water by the time the next official count is posted. This stretch goal is going down! So I tagged my early voting post even though I have no hand written note <url>"beer belly" oh wait...i see what you did there. sorry about that mix up. Thanks Ashley! Hi guys, I will be compiling your official update at 4:30pm PST. Keep up the good work! understood @CB we have 31 bear bellies now btw but now that we have crossed 25 I will update later Maybe if we can get up to 10,000 we can get a free achievement out of it.... that would also be a daunting task too though..... ^"Cheetah Cub" @Aether, I prefer the term, "bear belly." I would just put it off until Nov. 9th, so I'm glad it's not me..... ^"Cheetah Cub" Looks like a lot of early voters kept their stickers. We're already unofficially over 25 of those. ^"Cheetah Cub" Glad I don't have to count all of those, "I Voted" links. We're sure to keep Ashley busy for a while. I usually name him after whoever is pissing me off that day @Aether thanks, that does sound better *pregnant belly bear (Stomach sounds awful haha) @CB We already have 28 pics of voters, 1 pregnant bear stomach (24 to go), 2 speeches (23 to go) Maybe it'll be shaped like a diapered bear? Whoa, HA, I love your knife holder! Haha, that's the best part of that picture! @Zem maybe the box will look like a diaper...or a box of diapers? I know Dr. P! the challenge should be 10 pics of furred up daily objects! they are hilarious! @CB we already have 3 everyday objects with fur so that one should be already unlocked Me too, I was surprised there was only one needed We only NEED one fur-up so there's that in the bag! I really REALLY want to see more of those though....... ^"Cheetah Cub" Oh sure, I go away to add all of the new stretch goal tasks to www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html and come back to 55 Comments! @Allison - your life is awesome. I just covered my toaster in funfur and posted it on twitter, what is my life @Zem I know! and it was a good touch to include cards that we haven't seen before @GM sorry, I won't forget ;) @Aether: I wish them(and the rest of the world) luck as well. Seeing as I'm Canadian. Aether, aw hell yeah! Those cards look great! Oh wow, forgot about the flood of comments succeeding updates! ` So what do you guys think the box upgrade will be? Not another sound because that'd be repetitive and disappointing and they said "never been done", but I hope it's just as amazing and mind-blowing!!! I'm wondering if we'll get to choose the design of the condom wrapper or will it be a random one thrown in. Watch this! <url>"House Arrest" McNab As far as the pregnant women, i think some guys stomach's could be big enough too, lol electrical* lol, I'm imagining a fur covered toaster. Just be careful about appliances. @GM: That is well spoken. I know, I'm going to go dig out my fun fur and see if I have enough to cover an appliance For them to do I mean. @Aether: Fun and the USA political campaign do not go hand in hand. Maybe if we do well enough they'll unlock something for the international audience? I cannot for the life of me think of something that would be similar or individual to non-us peoples.... Don't be @House arrest I'm from outside the USA too but I think there are plenty of other fun things we can focus =) A shame our party system is broken to the point where only the two have any real chance of success.... I shall bring reinforcemnts Dr. P, CB is the strongest asset :P As a Canadian I feel left out but I also wouldn't want to be in their position Ha ha! I finally beat someone to the punch! The point is to get people to vote, so there may be leniency here where in other tasks there wasn't/isn't. They'll have to deal with people cheese-balling it as always though. Dr. P beat me XD @Stephen I would say to post it anyway and let them decide if it counts or not :) since this is a very limited challenge maybe they are already aware of early voters. Worst case scenario: 1 minute of your time// Best case scenario: 1 more pic of the thousand needed ;) Post it anyway, or tag an earlier post you did it said early voting in. What if you early voted? As in I already have a pic of me with my "I VOTED" Sticker on from last week but obviously without the handwritten note....I guess I can't participate in the new stretch goal then? Ohh I didn't think of the fridge! I am looking forward to the rousing speech/hymns too. Woohoo! @Alison, I love that you already have fun fur ready to go. :D Fridge might be an easy target... Or a tree trunk? Even better if you've got a cat half way up it. @Dr.P I was thinking the same thing, with two dogs my floor is covered in fur and my socks! Also, be mindful of your costumes those doing it. Don't go too overboard with people that might not have any clue if you are actually sane or not. I wonder how picky they're going to be about the bear on a pregnant belly pictures. All ladies could do that one My floor is covered in fur all the time, does that count? UUUH @House Arrest so many possibilities!!! Let me help: the car would be great like on the image maybe a couch or a chair? or dishes? or the computer & tv? Or the entrance door?? I think they'd be fine with a voting sticker selfie in front of a voting location. (Guess they're saying they want people to get out and vote) @Yohannon don't most polling locations give out little "I voted" stickers? If so, I think that should constitute as proof you voted. Getting prepared to help track of the vote pictures.... twitter is already starting :) I have yards of fun fur, not sure what I should put it on though @Alison if I have to I would buy an additional box to specifically determine if it's hackable to change (or at least disable) the noise. Would that help? (and yes, I am absolutely serious -- I'm still trying to change my Nissan Leaf's "warning" noise to sound like a Jetson's flying car. :P) WOO UPDATE TIME! So basically we're already 6 accomplishments toward a 15 accomplishment goal, with several of those goals super time sensitive (that is, you've got 36 hours here in the US of A to make them happen, folks!). If we couldn't get 1000 of near 62K to vote, y'all ain't the maniacs I know you to be. Please note that ballot selfies are actually illegal (though likely unconstitutional) in some locales. I'm hoping a photo in front of the polling location is okay in those circumstances! Well, I hope people in states that get stickers can do pictures... UPDATE! @Allison or maybe it will sound like a baby bear Is it worth the risk though @Allison with today's tech, it could be a random sound after you open it. So you can only wince some of the time. Update #6 is is up. Hit refresh. Heh, one of the "Bear" cards, is a Water Bear. ;) I'm guessing this box will sound like a bear when you open it, hopefully not a baby ewww Now the delay makes sense. Relying on the Americans of the group to get the "I voted" pictures Updated goals are up on the bvb website And Space, gah, it just keeps expanding, for who know how long and to where or when. .. oh, for The Love of Spock,could you give us a cryptic hint? :P Ah, nothing left today but to wait for the update! I love being done for the day. Urgh, my brain. /while we're waiting/ - complicated set-up for the challenges? Very curious. So, ah, about that weather. It's certainly been weatherly. Yeah, I think there was a set of cats dressed as fighter jets they treated as a single submission. Keeps the cheating to a minimum by spreading the opportunity to participate around, etc. ^What they said and far better. ^=^ @jonathon exactly what GM said and also: yesterday a different backer uploaded a pic with 5 people dressed as bears so we have unlocked that one too :) If the submission from the 5-person group is obviously the same people from the 10-person hroup, it will likely not get accepted, as they'd prefer just one submission per person/ group per attempt, rather than one person or set of people claiming them all. If you could get 50 people, for examples, you might claim them all... @Jonathan: It's likely that they wanted a separate photo for each one. Even though it technically does have the right number of people, they might want two different ones, and probably with a different group in the photo Hey sorry if this ha already been addressed I didn't feel like reading every comment, but I was looking at the stretch goal achievements, how did we get 10 people dressed as bears or babies without also getting the previous 5? @Aether - I know two of them, and neither had done art yet. Maybe it just needs to be better art :P And that's why you're the Periscope matey! I'm just too lazy, though I thought about going back for direct quotes. Will be good to add card sleeves even without any stretched goal... ^.^ Don't mind paying as long as it is not the cost of an arm or leg... I'm sure we'll get 75k backers @amanda maybe many of them were submitted by backers who already had already uploaded an art post but I think it's fine because every post may contribute to bring more people to the campaign and thus achieve the 75k backers @Zem, I searched through the periscope and yes it was a collective tradition @Cha was the one who said that she imagines you like that. "To cheer @Zem up...that's how I imagine you going to bed <url>" And one day I asked you to sing it before going to sleep "Aether Tower on October 28 I want to hear Zem sing that song the each time he says good night haha" And this is was the first you accepted: "Aether Tower 6 days ago Come on Zem, sing that song... you know you want to :P Micah "Zem the Mattress" Philson 6 days ago Damn you, Aether! I am not messing up the covers. Sliding in so as not to wrinkle all the sheets making sure the quilt stays nice and clean Have you ever seen a bed so neat? I'm getting intooo bed! ... sleepsleepsleeptimetogotosleepnow itisnightandineedtosleepwhileitisdark iamreallytiredtimeforsleep nowtiredtiredsleepsleepsleep I'm getting into bed!" I swear I saw like four works of art last night, but the count only went up by one. Weird. Well, we shall see what else is added today! Oh, the 10 minute one? I don't know, I could probably watch that entire video! Clayton Smith, the extended version? You mean the entire Friendship is Witchcraft episode or something? CB, my night tradition was started by, I want to say Cha!, but I'm not sure. Whomever said "Zem, this is how I imagine you going to bed every night!" and posted that. So I guess I'll have the link at the bottom of the good-night comment from now on. ;) @Rod sorry I didn't refresh my streach goal page I thought they didn't count it yet. My apologies! @DtQ, that was so 1625 backers ago... ;) Where's the round three stretch goals? We're losing momentum! Wait what about 60k backers? Thanks @Ashley! ^"Cheetah Cub" While we're waiting for that update, we got new official counts and we are confirmed for the food shares and five-person photo, so that puts us at 26 achievements. www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html Thanks for the info Ashley and enjoy another caffeinated beverage(you can never have enough) Good morning (afternoon) everyone. I have ingested my caffeinated beverage of choice, and I'm watching Elan excitedly get your next goal ready. In the meantime, here is your early update for the day: 7 baby tank, 12 pumpkins, 25 food shares, 15 beard babies, 18 art, 10 provokes, 1 photo with 5 bears. You’ve unlocked photo with 5 bears, and photos of food sharing. Congratulations! You are currently at 26 unlocked achievements. As always, we accept entries at our own discretion, and do not include double entries in the same category by the same person. If you have questions you can email us at <email> @elan thanks for the update! I am in the edge of my seat waiting! @elan you have me on the edge of my seat. I am sure you will not disappoint *@Date... Don't type and walk kids... @Save it's 5pm here in the UK! Hi @Elan! Woo, looking forward to it :) And while I know it's 9 in CA but in the find state of NJ it's 12 already! Not upset just anxious... Like waiting all day for that birthday gift you know you're getting Calm down all and listen to @GM's advice! ;) There's no need to get so upset about it! @Tom: it's still like 9am in CA, relax. Patience...everyone. Take a few hours and go enjoy nature, leave all electronics at home, and go for a walk. Or do some work if you're at work. The update will come when it comes. Where's the update. Thought you'd have three goals planned out already so as we reach them you post the next. But I was wayyyy wrong Still no update :/ They should have had a few caffeinated beverages by now @cb watch the "extended version" after a few minutes in I had to close out of it. I love how people always complain about the Pacific time zone, and I'm in it and still always feel like I'm waiting forever for them to update :P ^"Cheetah Cub" @GC, I agree. @Zem and @Cha! always seem to wait until an hour after I go to sleep to start one of their all-night parties. By the time I'm able to respond to one of their comments, eight hours have passed. Wow, that sounded grumpy! Got to consume more caffeinated beverages of choice. And this is the issue with being in the UK, it's 3pm here already - such little overlap. The amount of times I've been asleep when things are going on is rather annoying! ;) Yeah, it's still only like 7am there. They probably haven't even had a chance to ingest their caffeinated beverages of choice yet. Stupid California and their Pacific time zone! ^"Cheetah Cub" @Quack, me too. Unfortunately, I think we'll have to wait for California to wake up first. I just wish they'd post the update so we could get started already! ^"Cheetah Cub" Haha! Found it! <url>"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, you ol' tease, I wish you WOULD post the YouTube link. I see your sleep ritual every night and it looks like a song or a movie quote, but I never get to see the original source, so I feel like I'm missing out on half of the joke. No need to be negative @Tom. We still have ten days. That is a lot of time, an entire third of this campaign! We'll knock it out. I have a feeling it will be different this time around somehow. Morning all. I have confidence in us finishing the challenges. If CB got a tattoo I can't imagine anything we can't accomplish.. I'm sure we won't have any problem with the next challenges - such an amazing group of backers who have done some great things! Looking forward to getting stuck into them (providing my adulting doesn't get in the way too much!) They may have to scale, as needed. Some of the extras from the last campaign came about because of its wild success, such as the box. We may or may not have that as an option. I would expect a card expansion, as that is certainly doable. Just depends on how many people join in the last days. Fsh participants will bring a bit more verve to the challenges. We'll see. We are going to have a really small window for the next goal with next to impossible challenges in that small amount of time Zelda teaches you not to kill someone's chickens. Skyrim reminds you. And by "going to bed", I mean talking with my roommates for an hour, and then, and ONLY THEN, going to sleep. Late night, third week Sunday, often the slowest time during a KS campaign, before it picks up again. Nice thing about the the Bethesda games, is they still have the ultimate cheat option, built in. I think during the start-up process, or at some key combo press, you can enter ~tgm , to get invincibilty. The old "God Mode" , cheat, which makes you invulnerable. Good for those days when you want to peave villagers by accosting their chickens, or whatever, without the guards doing you in. ;) Heh, I tried not to use up my hour of sleep this weekend so I could use it now, but it's midnight anyways. Probably a good thing I did that, or else I would have had even less sleep! Fine, had 2 things, now one. I'm starting to think I should put the youtube link after this so it's not so weird to people who didn't see this. ` I am not messing up the covers. Sliding in so as not to wrinkle all the sheets making sure the quilt stays nice and clean Have you ever seen a bed so neat? I'm getting intooo bed! ... sleepsleepsleeptimetogotosleepnow itisnightandineedtosleepwhileitisdark iamreallytiredtimeforsleep nowtiredtiredsleepsleepsleep I'm getting into bed! ` It's especially funny because when I copy&paste that, I have to redo all the returns because they're not saved on my profile's comment record, so as I hold right every time, I sing the lyric in my head, and then hit return and do it with the next line! It's kind of a game now to try and do it perfectly so I don't have to delay the next line and it all comes out as fast as the song! ;) G'nite, y'all's! Btw, thanks Amanda, we have now 27 food shares, 2 extra art pieces (22 total, 3 to go). Let's see tomorrow how close we are to the official count. And that thing is sing Zem, I presume Amanda, I spent 30 minutes before remembering you could put a basket over the shopkeeper's head, and then it went way smoother. 50 minutes total! But I hope I get my 3000 coins back! Thankfully you can make it all into potions to sell, but the clothes I'll have to take to a fencer. Dang you, now I want to play again! No, I have to do one more thing and then sleep! @Zem - At least you got to loot a shop! I miss playing Skyrim, I should get back into it. One of my favorite songs, it gives me shivers Metallica <url>"Cheetah Cub" Totals on www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html have been updated. That puts our unofficial achievements total to 26. ^"Cheetah Cub" Also, the bear group photo does not have the hashtag. It looks like someone is trying to use a "found" photo that wasn't actually created specifically for this campaign. That's why they're so strict with the handwritten hashtag requirement. It immediately disqualifies photos found via a Google search. Yes and sadly the handwritten note is missing... I used an image google search and couldn't find the picture nowhere else so maybe they actually took the pic for BvB =/ Anyway, the pic with 5 people is there so, 0 left to go 25 Food share (0 to go) 20 art (5 to go) 15 beard babies (10 to go) 12 Bvb pumkins (13 to go) 9 provokes (16 to go) 7 baby tanks (18 to go) Note: one of the new food shares is doubtful so it would be good if someone who hasn't uploaded one could do it and then I'm sure that food share will be unlocked ^"Cheetah Cub" There's a group photo on Facebook, but I only counted 47 bears. :-( This same thing happened on Exploding kittens. Several attempts were made before one had the required minimum number of people. @CB just finished doing what I was doing so yes, give me 15 min and I'll give you an updated unofficial count ;) And a food share is up. Pumpkins will have to wait until tomorrow <url>"Cheetah Cub" @Aether, are you getting these? Will we have updated counts tonight? Provoke submitted <url>"Cheetah Cub" Welcome back, @Justin. Way to jump right in after getting back! My Beard baby submission is up <url>#7,070) but I've been out of town for work until now. I'm amazed at how much you have all done already with the stretch goals! Hopefully now that I'm back home I can help out more. Wife and I have each submitted a piece of art, friend is working on beard baby and provoke, will upload a food share later. Also working on pumpkin carving. #letsdothis ^"Cheetah Cub" Things have been so busy around here I fell five days behind on scraping the comments. Those have been updated too. ^"Cheetah Cub" If the 5 person photo is confirmed, and I don't see why it wouldn't be, We are now at 25 achievements, 5 over what was needed for Stretch Goal 2! I've marked it as a maybe again on www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html ^"Cheetah Cub" I love the face swap selfie taken in front of the mirror. The handwritten hashtag comes out backwards. Lol. Good thing we already have enough face swaps so we don't have to worry about whether it's acceptable. WTG everyone still banging out those stretch goals! Awesome! 5 people dressed as Bears looks great! Also, I find it humerous that out of the current 60,862 backers, 92% have pledged for the NSFW pack :D Holy hell, the Huskers went down 12 ranks after last night's abomination! I mean, I expected it, but holy crap! Then again, 62-3. We earned this. Funny, though, how OSU didn't go up at all, even with that! The top teams are so well rooted that they couldn't even go up one. Or maybe those just haven't been updated yet. It is still pretty early. 5people dressed as bears is up on twitter Working with my wife on helping with the stretch goals. Unfortunately we don't currently have a baby so we're trying to farm out help on that ;) I agree that we should push to unlock everything. We're going to work on pumpkin carving shortly ^"Cheetah Cub" No problem, Elan. Thanks for clearing that up. I'm not all that concerned with collectibility personally, but In know that other people are. Thanks for the prompt answer. Well I was thinking of this as a collectible, and a gift to kickstarter backers, not something that in 40 years will go on ebay for $2000, but yeah, I was hoping Elan would respond quickly enough for me to add onto the backside of my comment. ^"Cheetah Cub" Hold on there, Zem. @Brendan brings up an important question because it speaks to the collectability of the KS exclusive card. Right now, they're committed to producing and distributing over 60,000 copies of the card. If they offer multiples to backers who pledge for multiple decks, that will make even more of those "limited edition" cards available, which could reduce their overall value. I think this is definitely one question that will have to wait for an official answer from Elan. I could see the decision going either way. Brendan, I think the extra card will come within the normal deck, and since you're getting two entire sets, yes, I'd say it's safe to assume that. If we donate $70 in order to receive 2 decks / 2 NSFW boosters, will we also receive two copies of the "kickstarter extra card?" Thank you. I forgot about the test parties. I hope we get one in D.C. ^"Cheetah Cub" Just a little break, though. We'll all be looking forward to participating in the play test parties. You're too awesome, Elan. I don't know what achievement we earned to deserve your dedication! Don't worry, you can take a bit of a break when the campaign is over, though. Morning!! Congratulations all fellow backers for what we have done! I've had a busy week but next one I will be back as active as ever and with a BvB themed song (even though the art goal is unlocked at that time, it's is something I wanna do). Will post a BvB food share today (I can't believe I haven't done that one). Talk to you later, and as Cha said: seize the Sunday!! It would be awesome to unlock every single challenge in BvB This again? Why do so many people want EK on this? It way overcomplicates everything, and you can already get it on amazon much more simply, and it'll be delivered instantly rather than waiting several months! @Dr.P...yours is the official verbatim version. Much more legit :) Our whole family is so excited for this game!! We backed Exploding Kittens and it's my kiddos favorite game. I'm amazed at how much they old are learning about strategy at such a young age. Keep up the good work! (Example in video above at time code 1:11 roughly) Ah, Cha! beat me to it! I'm always a step behind...... In the video above @Michael Harley it shows a "person" playing the game having more than one monster for the example. . .Also, Elan said this earlier: . ."Hey guys. You're doing amazing job on the achievements! We'll post an update with the next batch soon...We're just double checking we don't introduce anything that will slow down production of the actual game. I Wanted to chime in quickly on the "print and play" rules idea. I'm really excited to get the rules and prototype decks into your hands ASAP. That's exactly the plan after the campaign when we have our final list of backers. We'll be sending early versions of the game to a few hundred playtest parties to show you what we've got, ask some questions, and get your help with the final touches. (rules for hosting parties will be posted after the campaign) I'm really proud of this game. We build and test it every night, and it continues to improve. It's fun and funny and has amazing strategy. But I still think it can be better. That's what we'll need your help with...in fact, that's the whole reason we're here instead of putting this straight onto store shelves." @Michael... you can build as many monsters as you like/can. All the monsters by all players join forces to defeat the babies. The rules are not set in stone yet, as Elan had shared in an earlier comment, they are continued to be refined and they are looking to play test with the community to do so. Thanks! I hope yours is enjoyable as well! @Amanda... awesome! Enjoy your Sunday! Happy Sunday indeed! I (and the other, less involved parts of my family who also eagerly await the game, but don't do a lot of posting about it) are visiting extended family today. Gonna try to get a food share and maybe that 5 people dressed as bears shot. Happy Sunday all, much has been accomplished over the past day. We've officially unlocked 24 achievements and the campaign page as well as BvB and CubSubCorps websites are up to date on what has been unlocked. We’ve officially unlocked battle scenes, faceswaps, 20 foot monster, a photo of 10 people dressed as bears, and 60,000 backers!! While we eagerly await for the posting of Round 3 stretch goal challenges why not use your Sunday to unlock more of the current ones. Here's where we are at on some: 5 baby tank, 12 pumpkins, 22 food shares, 14 beard babies, 17 art, 8 baby provokes Just 3 more food shares and 7 art to go. So share Bear Baby Beer food with friends and make some art! :) @ Elan Lee: in normal game, can I build more than 1 bear/monster to fight the babies (per player) our cab each player build just one monster/bear? @Zem...yes, it's a lovely and oh so well fitting "Zem the Mattress" tradition :) Hi @Geist...oh yes, I needed that extra hour Morning cubs. Did you enjoy your extra hour of sleep? *As they already have to send out 60k+ packages Nate that may be it. Many game creators on Kickstarter offer their previous games so I don't think it's a terrible idea. Though they may skip it just to keep things simple. As they Ajay have to send out 60k+ packages I think the reason exploding kittens isn't offered through KS is because it's on Amazon with free, two day shipping for most of America, or free regular shipping if you buy both regular and Nsfw EK. 60k backers that's another achievement! I second the request for exploding kittens added to bvb in a tier!! @ Dave: thx @michael in not sure but my guess is yes Yea a pack of Exploding Kittens would be awessssomeeee @creator Is there any chance of offering another reward tier or way to also add on the exploding kittens game for those of us unfortunate enough to not have a copy to call their own? So this way it gets sent at once? (minimising shipping costs) Thanks and can't wait for this one Guys, I asked this before, but I can't find the answer. Can I build more than one monster to fight ther babies? Like, can I draw multiple bodies or heads and build them or do I have to chose one monster to build. Heehee, I really do like that tradition! Thanks so much for bringing it up, Cha!! It was you, right? I remember it as you who found that because you do the songs as it is, and you thought of me when you saw that. Anyways, yup, callin it quits a bit early this time. G'nite, Ned! <url>` I am not messing up the covers. Sliding in so as not to wrinkle all the sheets making sure the quilt stays nice and clean Have you ever seen a bed so neat? I'm getting intooo bed! ... sleepsleepsleeptimetogotosleepnow itisnightandineedtosleepwhileitisdark iamreallytiredtimeforsleep nowtiredtiredsleepsleepsleep I'm getting into bed! And that's Lorde (damn you autocorrect) Baby Battle Song Lords - Glory and Gore <url># And now it's only 1:05am... Huh? Oh, I've been going to sleep at like 3:30 am the past several days, so not even close yet. Is it that time again or too early for you @Zem? :) CB, I think most people cheered because it was a miracle he could walk this week, much less be let out to go back to watch the game within minutes! So thankful, and I hope he can play next week. Nebraska was also probably cheering even more because now we have an excuse for that score. "Well, Tommy was out or else we might have had a more favorable score!" ^"Cheetah Cub" And with that, I think I'll go and catch that extra hour of sleep I should be getting. See everyone on the flip side. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, sorry you had to see that. I think the high point of the game was when the injured player returned to the stadium and fans of BOTH teams cheered. That reflects well on the Big 10. Woo, 60K! ... it'd better not stay at 62K. I'm watching you kickstarter! "AAALWAYS WAAAAATCHIIING" -Roz, Monsters Inc. Sorry, guys, I was out with my family watching the Husker game. Whoo, it was a bad one. We were against the toughest team in our league, but the only thing that makes A FREAKING 62-3 LOSS not so embarrassing is that our best player got the crap knocked out of him, nearly very, very serious (thankfully not). But even so... that is literally the WORST game I have ever seen. Christ! ... uh, guys?... "Show 62 newer comments". Is Kickstarter mocking me? I'm having flashbacks equivalent to saying "7-1" to a Brazilian!!! ^"Cheetah Cub" Thanks @Ashley. We appreciate you working so late on a Saturday. That shows that Elan has brought a dedicated team together to make sure this campaign is a success. ^"Cheetah Cub" The uodated official totals are now posted on www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html for all of you. Elan is working hard on the third update/stretch goal. Its a special one and a bit tricky to set up. We're hoping for tomorrow, but worse case scenario it'll be up Monday. holy carp, I JUST looked up, and it was like 60K and 16.... I blinked! Where's the 3rd goal? Edit: You guys already unlocked battles. Disregard that category. All others are accurate and up to date. I can't bearlieve I missed that one. Hi everyone! 24 hours and you have done some insane things! Here is your Saturday update: 5 baby tank, 12 pumpkins, 22 food shares, 14 beard babies, 17 art, 25 faceswaps, 9 battle, 8 provokes, 1 20 foot monster, 1 photo with 10 bears You’ve unlocked faceswaps, 20 foot monster, a photo of 10 people dressed as bears, and 60,000 backers. Congratulations! You're so close to so many others; keep up the hard work! As always, we want this to be a community experience, so we accept entries at our own discretion and limit the amount of entries per category per person. If you have any questions over our selection process, or you're worried we missed something (there is a lot that gets bearied), feel free to email us at <email> I'll be back tomorrow with another update. Have a good weekend! ^"Cheetah Cub" At the rate we're going, they could wait several more days to reveal the next stretch goal and we'd STILL meet it with time to spare. GO CORPS! @--C...trust the wife :) and no licks from the pup! :) I just hope they aren't intentionally taking the weekend off in the hopes that we'll be too busy adulting to do the tasks :P Probably not, but I'm one of those people who often assumes everyone is purposely super-mean, even when they aren't. I'm hoping for an update tonight or in the morning. ^"Cheetah Cub" They might be taking the weekend off. Can you imagine how many people will go to work there on Monday, look at what we've accomplished, and need a change of underwear? Lol. Come on already! Announce the third stretch goal so we can get to work on achieving it! I hope it's the expansion of the NSFW expansion to a full sized deck. It would be so cool to have a completely disgusting NSFW game. ^"Cheetah Cub" The tattoo dude said to use Neosporin, but my wife switched us to Bacitracin years ago. She didn't like Neosporin and I took her word for it, because she was a nurse. ^"Cheetah Cub" Bacitracin. If Cappuccino licks it, I need to wash it right away and apply a fresh coat of Bacitracin. @--C...did you get A+D and keeping it ointmented? ^"Cheetah Cub" @!C, it's a bit sore, kind of like road rash. I have to keep chasing Cappuccino away so he doesn't lick it. @--C..thank you for always diligently updating the CubSubCorps website!! How is your tattoo? Probably - I can't wait to see what it is - I'd love to spend some time tomorrow on something crazy before going back to adulting too much. ^"Cheetah Cub" I'll bet Stretch Goal 3 will require more than 25 achievements. :-) Now come out come out wherever you are backer number 60k! ^"Cheetah Cub" And stretch goal totals updated yet again! We now have either 23 or 24, unofficially. www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html 59,998 .... *blinks* 60,001 You're awesome Kevin "Pub Cub" ^Thumbs^ McVittles!! :) 60K - pow! Just click The Button, do it! ;) 2 - wrapped up like a deuce (almost) 3 is the Magic Number 4 might be Fantastic, but the last movie adaptation was less so. The previous was a reference to The Prisoner, a bit of an odd British series. 5 - they usually skip this in count-downs, because it sounds suspiciously like Fire. ^No, I am a Free human kind of thing, or something hopefully similar, though there are times. OK< where were we? I am Number 6! ;) Number 9, Number 9... We need to pick up speed, or we'll never make it through, I think Gene Wilder once said. 10 - readying for take-off, final check-list. 12 - almost free. 14 - Supermoon coming up next week. 15 is Nifteen, almost there. 16 - Candles 17 - Dancing Queen. 18 - again. I only wish. 20 - countdown is go. ^"Cheetah Cub" You can also get Jacobs Creme Crackers imported. "Cracking crackers, Gromit! ..." No, couldn't ship those, everywhere. I thin k one of the issues with Jelly Babies was that the gelatin they were made with, didn't fit some standards in the US, or some such. You can get them imported, though. *drapes lomg-ish scarf over shoulders* ^"Cheetah Cub" @PC, I used to try to get the sardine flavored ones. They were my faves. Oh, a pack of Gummies might be a nice extra - make them absurd flaves, like the Every Flavour Beans from that Wizarding School series - you know the one. Set it free, folks, like a Sugar-Free Haribo bear might do to some people's iunner workings. :P How about a pledge extra to receive the full set of condoms? *grabs the blotter pen, ready to mark off the achievement, hoping the ink doesn't dry out before he gets the chance.* :P Oh, had to take a pot-shot, helps to ease the tension. Bite me. ;) 48, it goes so fast 51 to go 64 till 60k Everybody is a Captain Kirk. Well, do as Picard might do and "Make it so!" Just 86 more! :P Well..89 :) Just... Nena - 99 Luftballons <url>"nicely"open the package. Lol. Really would love to hurt that artwork. I would buy a more readily available pack. Hahahaha ^"Cheetah Cub" (warning, NSFW) @Felix, I would be willing if she's willing. @mike would you actually be willing to use them? I might want to keep them as is.. Less than 250 would-be, adventurous, fun-loving and utterly mad pledgers, needed to crush another task, in this case, crossing the 60K backer mark, on our quest to unlock the unneccesary, but goodness would they be fun to have " Next Neat Things". If it's an expansion to one of the decks, it will really be something you kinda, really want, anyways. A nice box or sumptin' like that, might be nice, too. Anyways, it's something "right there" and one can participate with little fuss and you don't have to post your mug or be wildly creative to unlock it. :P (It certainly helps, though - if you check out the latest update, you can get an apprecation of the creative sillyness that has pushed us this far, already and consider if you might join in. It's kinda fun and we wouldn't mind the help , and of course, the company. Hello!) Well there are always those that have to collect everything in a set too. ^"Cheetah Cub" Lol. When I saw that there were actually 8 designs, I knew some people would want all of them. I have to admit that I like them all and wouldn't mind being given an opportunity to get all of them myself even though I haven't "needed" a condom for quite some time. I would have to find a "volunteer" to help me actually use one. ;-) No shave November is just a conspiracy against Big Razor. We're taking down the corporations! ^And while we're there, a Mindful Movember to you, too, guys, for yourselves and your partners and others who care about you.. ^=^ Though, I guess that might be the side connection and tie-in, in this campaign, as the Exploding Kittens was for pet adoption. It is currently one condom going by wording, they may change that in the future or they may not. We'll ensure it is voiced as something people would like to change. Reproduction *zing* , on that scale, might be difficult, if they offered multiples, at least with enough quality-control to ensure they might accomplish their intended function. ;) I wouldn't expect them to, they're a novelty item, but people are people... ;) Guess they could print the art on a slip of paper, included along with. Still, a muti-pack option would be nice, just for completists, if they could. Though, also, I guess some might not abide on the "Public Service" and humor of intent and might be willing to part with or if they do and want to collect, might be willing to trade for others. my guess is we get one condom @creator For the new stretch goal unlocked, do we only get a random single condom Or do we get all the ones posted. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Aether Tower's unofficial counts have been posted. Once we get the official counts, we should have 2 0r 3 more unlocked achievements. Like the SG!! It's a beautiful fall day to be out here in Philly :) Chicago - Saturday In The Park <url>"Cheetah Cub" Good morning, my frozen Northern friends. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Quack, yes I did, but I didn't think it would pass as a "handwritten hashtag. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Quack, it's not something to rush into. When I see a full sleve or a chest covered with tattoo, it blows me away to think about how much money it must have cost him. Maybe he sold his car to get them. No they definitely can't. Did you think about tattooing the # onto the logo as well. Then you could have skipped the sign! ^"Cheetah Cub" I love the "right to bear arms" tie-in. Nobody can say that I don't support the 2nd Amendment now. Shawn, greetings from NJ! You're a team player for sure! I've never gotten a tattoo. One day right now it's just not in the budget. ^"Cheetah Cub" Thanks, @Quack. It's a little sore this morning, but I;ve been keeping it clean. Good morning from Canada, my Kickstarter BvB pals! Hey CB! I've been watching for you...Your tattoo looks great! ^"Cheetah Cub" Oh man, I feel like I've been run over by a 20 foot baby! Morning folks! I want all the condoms! Should do as an add-on! We're @ 59.28K Backers!!! @Zem - We changed our clocks back last weekend in the U.K. Enjoy your extra sleep x WOO! Tomorrow is the Fall Back daylight savings change! I'm not going to set it back until sunday night, though, so I can give myself an extra hour of sleep before monday! Great end to the week! Man, I'm tired. Almost kept going on Skyrim, but I realized after doing this mission I'd want to sell everything, then get caught up in something else, and realized I should just go to sleep. Many things happened today, awesome! It's good to have a gallery I just saw this game being 22222% funded. My life is now complete. My Name is Nobody. Nobody did it, I saw him! Nothing to see here, move along. I've always wondered why cardstock was such a big deal to some people. I never have a problem with cards, and trust me, I run them through the paces! My EK deck has been used dozens of times, and only one or two cards have any damage at all, and that's only like a slightly bumped corner. Are some people playing these games hundreds of times with 5 year olds? I mean, not to sound rude, which this might come across as by accident, but it doesn't seem like it should be that big of a deal. They're not supposed to last forever, but most cards usually do. Ah, nothing like some good 'ol Kung Pow! Greatest movie ever! Can't leave out Rawhide <url>"Cheetah Cub" @Pyt Viper, what is your opinion of the PVC card idea? ^"Cheetah Cub" Hey, there's photos of 5 prople dressed like bears and 10 people dressed like beard on Facebook. The five person photo just uses half of the same people as in the ten person photo, so it might not count, but you never know whether these might help us reach Stretch Goal 3. Card stock, to me, is extremely important. ^"Cheetah Cub" Currently 61st most funded, 20th most backed, 10076away from 60,000 backers. ^"Cheetah Cub" My initial reaction to the idea of PVC cards is not good. It sounds to me like these "indestructible" cards would have a horrible hand feel, be too stiff to shuffle easily, and generally come across as "cheap." I don't wand a deck of cards that I can spill beer on and then hose them down afterward. I want a deck that looks and feels elegant. That's just my initial reaction though. Can you point me to some reviews of PVC cards by discerning gamers? I'd seriously like to read more about them before making a decision about whether they would be appropriate for this game. It doesn't sound to me like the kind of cards most of us would want. What about creating an "Apocalypse Proof" version of the cards and using PVC (like poker cards from Copag or KEM Arrow) so that they're indestructible? They'll obviously cost more, but customers would pay more so they aren't worried about spilling their drinks, beers, and hot wing sauce on them, plus they don't crease if you bend them. Typical PVC playing cards can be cleaned with a damp cloth or some can even be put in the dishwasher (or so I've heard). The drawback for you: if someone purchases the apocalypse proof deck, they most likely won't be buying new core decks for when they destroy the original. Just take the amount of average profit made per customer on buying multiple/replacement decks, and make sure to incorporate that full profit margin, plus another 25-50%, into the margin of the apocalypse decks. That should make up for loss on regular customers buying replacements! Nice work! @Mike Kabala - Oh of course I would miss the connotation to the stretch "bonus". :-P @Kevin Okay, that is just cool. Now if that "junkyard battery" thing works out, we're all set. ;-) I hope the card stock is better than the exploding kittens card stock!! ^Wrong space ^=^ Much of the development made possible by the makerverse and tools now available to creators, has allowed a certain surplus of available capacity, in some regards and made things more negotiable. I've been seeing items milled out of Titanium, being offered with a base funding of $10K for some projects, unheard of a couple of years, ago. Small start-ups are able to fashion new tool-kits, in-shop or replace worn parts much more effeciently and at lower cost. Pretty nifty. ^"Cheetah Cub" Yay, looks like we got the card stock upgrade! We've taken this relationship to a new level. ^"Cheetah Cub" Heh heh, @Yohannon. We know which of the BvB condoms you'll be wanting, don't we? Besides, only 1125 from the next stretch goal of 60K bear backers! Uh.... that sounded different in my head. (And in case it's not clear or snark filters are set to "stun"; I'm just kidding around. I'm just jazzed to be a small part of this insanity. AGAIN. :D) Uht-oh, randomly inserted extra packet for the NSFW add-o, looks like. ;) @Amanda And I've seen many of your pics; You was ROBBED! :P Aww, scary magnet ball big diaper baby didn't make the cut. FOO! I say! Ah well, let me see what's left that I can do something terrifying with. I apparently need to up my game. Not a single photo of mine in the gallery! Awesome gallery! Just saw it! Was hoping for SG3, but guess we'll keep waiting for that. Enjoying the gallery in the meantime. Refresh for update 5!!! Congratulations to all the creative contributors! Well done (and wow, that was fast). You're totally, absolutely, 100% the only one refreshing.... *glues F5 key back in place* PC, you are. This is all in your mind. I assume I'm not the only one hitting refresh? ;^] Note to self: When the sales manager is taking you out for lunch, be sure to eat lots of breads, and other alcohol absorbing foods.... lol, i was looking at @Zem messages looking for the hidden comment reference...then i got it. ^"Cheetah Cub" Oh wow! They just came out with a LEGO Yellow Submarine! <url>"Zem the Mattress" : loving the Hitchhikers reference. Dr. P, i rarely watch speedruns, but I love Paper Mario alot, so it's alot of fun to learn some of these exploits and workarounds, and just generally see how in the heck they do it this fast. I've only seen speedruns of Paper Mario and the famous Ocarina of Time world record. Hope it something amazing I can't wait either LOL hopefully it's something I can help with :D Yippee for completing number 2! Can't wait to see number 3! I don't necessarily get into the speed runs, but I might binge watch some super beard bros. tomorrow that I've been 'saving up', that or just play some games. I'll have other stuff to do, so I won't be able to get TOO engrossed. Yayy! We did it :D ooh.... Though, as you may have heard, I'm into the Paper Mario stuff. (hot topic right now, I'm sure, it being a 15 year old 64 game), and I've watched both the world record any% and non-glitch speedruns (1 hour 44 min. and 3:50), so after this, I may also watch the world record 100% speedrun I have on a tab here! Guess how long that speedrun is? ` Go on, guess. ... If you guessed nearly 6 hours, you were right! Yeah, I might end up putting that off for tomorrow. That thing is most of a full day in itself! How do these guys pull it off?! Well, right now a recorded livestream I can't believe I missed yesterday, but this is 2 hours long, so after I finish it, I'll probably go straight over to Paper Mario. Anything in particular on the youtube? Although between eating and just generally not giving a [dang] today, I probably won't be on much, I'll probably hop between youtube, Skyrim, and my current re-playthrough of Paper Mario. Over halfway done, and in only 9 hours or so! ^"Cheetah Cub" Thanks, Elan. You're my favorite @Creator. Pretty much Furries. I'm trying to get a hold of the baby Fur community to see about doing that ten people dressed as babies dealie done I went to get food, Dr. P. Jeez, I didn't know you guys relied on me so much! ;) Did we lose Zem again? Now I seriously hope it's Gwenyth Paltrow lol Pub Cub A Feririar of Furious Furry Fabricators? ;) So...whats on the card? WHAT'S ON THE CARD?!?!?!? Super-duper official even! Huzzah! It's official! That must be it Zem, I think you've got it. Furry furry artists? Furry as in furry, or furry as in Furry? I'm sending a wave of starving furry artists to make some quick sketches! Maybe, maybe not. I'm excited to see what they come up with myself. Hope round 3 is expansion of NSFW booster into a full game. ^"Cheetah Cub" The "official" page is now updated. <url>"Cheetah Cub" Hi, @Zem. We've been busy while you were out. :-) How do we have only two provokes though, that's got to be easier than the gummy bear stacking and we did that already..... Also hi Zem! (you're late) Woo! Round 2 is done! Aah! I know you guys are freaking out wondering where I am, but you can call off the police search party. I was just sleeping, and when I wasn't sleeping, I was at class wishing I was sleeping. But lo, I'm here now. ^"Cheetah Cub" New totals have been posted to <url>"Cheetah Cub" The famous battle just got accepted. We did it! Sweet! My husband's in the process of doing one now too, so if gerber/care bear doesn't work, we hopefully have one that will. "Cheetah Cub" 1,548 away from 60,000 backers too! "Cheetah Cub" Ooh, they reposted the Care Bears vs the Gerber baby battle with the hashtag! Hopefully that will put us over the top for SG2. ^"Cheetah Cub" Meanwhile, keep on posting those face swaps and food shares. We are so close! ^"Cheetah Cub" OK, I've commented on the Care Bears vs the Gerber baby post on Facebook telling them what we need. Let's all hope that they see it! We have three really close categories! ^"Cheetah Cub" New totals have been posted to www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html Come on, we only need one more famous battle! Hello! Here is your early update for the day. Update: 2 baby tank, 11 pumpkins, 19 food shares, 12 beard babies, 13 art, 20 faceswaps, 9 battle, 2 provokes You only need one more battle, six more food shares, or five more faceswaps for Round 2 to be unlocked. Good luck! Tell them they need to edited the post and add the hashtag, that is a part of the submission process and also makes it so that they can actually find it. ^"Cheetah Cub" Not much else being posted that I can see. ^"Cheetah Cub" Looks like another famous battle was posted on Facebook with a handwritten hashtag in the photo, but there was no hashtag in the text of the message itself, so I don't know if it counts. Hope so, because that would put us one away in that category/ have not even* I still need to get it, like I said I'm behind on my game and expansion purchases.... I have even grabbed up Betrayal at House on the Hill: Widow's Walk!! Thought I'd throw it out there that I played EK with the Imploding Kitten expansion yesterday and we liked it a lot. Well done, Elan and everyone. :) It's rare for an expansion to work well with the original game and IK does. It's a lot of fun, and makes for some interesting strategy. I'm just staring at the clock waiting for this last half an hour of work to tick by... I swear it's going backwards... I'm procrastinating my adulting by checking KS, FB, playing a game on my phone(at work, in my office), and messaging friends. I don't have tons to do today, and I'm going to talk to my manager about going home between 2:30 and 3 because of it(it's also rather quiet around here, with only 11/20 people in the office today). This is true, which means it will probably be a quite weekend in the comment section for the most part. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Dr.P. I noticed. Everyone must be getting in all of their adulting in at the end of the week so they can play all weekend. It is kind of dead today....... Ah, I misspelled the hashtag in my photoshop/edit submission! Rats. @Mary: That would mean waiting far too long to be able to play EK. You can order it on Amazon, and have it in less than a week(depending on where you are, and what the shipping is like). It doesn't really make sense to have that as a tier option when the two games are vastly different. If this was an expansion to EK, then it would make sense to have a tier that had EK in it. Would have loved to buy this game and Explosing kittens in one tier... All too true Geist. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Dr.P. I just need to wash gently wash it once in a while, then apply some Bacitracin to keep it from getting infected. The most annoying part was having to put on clean bedsheets before going to bed last night. I changed my avatar this morning. Adulting sucks more often than not After the next update I'll see what's still needed and try to submit stuff � adulting had been sucking my soul lately � Just 1818 more pledgees until the 60K backer unlock. If nothing else, one that can't be disputed.:P Then we can worry about the final round, going into the final two weeks. Cool :) Must just have been tired brain interpretation. By my estimate we got two battle posters and two face swaps last night. But I agree - adulting does get in the way. (and remember those handwritten #hashtag notes in your submissions everybody!!!!) We do need to get our unofficial counts going to, I've been doing to much adulting to be accurate myself though. I don't see anything to indicate it wasn't accepted yet, they probably just haven't done an official recount again yet. . . Also to reiterate what the collaborator said earlier about entries: . Ashley Collaborator about 13 hours ago And to answer any questions how we choose what qualifies: we limit the amount of entries, per category, per person. You can do multiple entries per category, but we don't want the count to be over saturated by an individual. If you have any more questions you can email <email> @Evan - I know the official update is later (I'm in their time zone). It just sounded like someone said they weren't counted (and cubsub doesn't have an updated estimate), so I thought maybe they were binned. Glad to hear they haven't. @Amanda: They probably just haven't been seen. We'll get an official update between 130 to 230 pm EST (They are also in CA, so they are probably not awake at present.) I think one to two entries person is probably what they are looking for, it is supposed to be a group effort after all. Wouldn't be very social otherwise. One could totally get someones friends and family to post the pictures of their own babies though. @Evan - yeah, probably. On the other loosely related to you note, did they officially not count the two battle posters from last night, or have they just not been seen? Oh, maybe that's why.... damn. @Evan - I saw a group baby photo, but it was just a random internet photo, not a BVB one. @Allison/Will - Yeah, they didn't specify how many a person could post (although, they have said that the same thing in multiple positions doesn't count, so it may be one per baby). I wish they would have before I recorded 6 unique songs. But at least I have a good reason to stop singing now. Someone is doing a group pic! I swear I just saw one, and then it vanished! I can't find it again............. HUMBUG! Hmm.... I'll think about it CB, but I really am no good at photoshop/edit stuff. The tattoo doing well? What all did they recommend to you for cleaning and care? Coming along great with with the page CB! That's nice Bryan. Looking good @CB. Loved the tattoo btw :D Hopefully we'll get to 20 today! ^"Cheetah Cub" Oops, I found some errors in the "Remaining" column for the stretch goals. I have posted a corrected page arranged by approximate achievability in descending order. <url>"Cheetah Cub" @Dr.P. Maybe you should have changed it to "Only you can Provoke Baby Attacks" instead. Should I have left the "only you can prevent forest fires" bit at the bottom? So looking forward to this game! I backed Exploding Kittens and love it. Just got the expansion delivered from Amazon the other day. The cone of shame is hilarious!! I am excited for more entertaining nonsense from Bears vs. Babies! :D @Zem i looked at those pages a week ago (I actually laughed at some jokes and to some alternative way to call Superbackers and their definition!). Also, I am glad thay the pony song is a thing XD ^"Cheetah Cub" @Will Nyteshade, The 5 person photo and the 10 person photo need to be two separate pictures, like with the gummy bear ones. If you get ten people in diapers, you could try taking one pic with all ten and another pic with just five of them, but I can't guarantee they'd accept both of them if the same five people are also in the ten person photo. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Will Nyteshade, lol. You just reminded me of an episode of Simon's Cat! <url>` See? I can remember. You can't do too many posts for any one category unless they're all completely different, and even then, they'll only accept a few depending on how many are needed for that category. And they don't like it when you flood them. Well I hope they do, don't wanna flood pics They haven't come out and said what the individual limit is, as far as I've seen It would be great to see a sealed promo-foil card for backers as part of the strech goals. That would be a nice addition to the set. Hmm, what's the max amount of entries per category an individual can do? That way I don't like..just take ten pics of provoking my friends baby Oh yeah...anyone in orange county want to get one there to do the group bear or baby photo? Can grab some of those cheapo dollar store adult diapers, I'm willing to, guess we gotta get as many people as possible in the same pic and not individual people, if anything if we get ten, that will get rid of two achievements at once Maybe a before and after photo will stop people's panties from getting in a wad Dun dun dunnnn! Or will it? ... Just wondering...how bad can we go when we take pictures of right before you provoke a baby? Because I was gonna do a baseball bat raised up in the air sorta thing...or maybe something that looks like a stick of dynamite (of course the child would be safe) Aether, look in the Sub dictionary and jokebook! Heck, most of those are my fault! (the dictionary at least) Uhu i should be long... Ben Howard - In Dreams <url>#BearsVsBabies I didn't think to go to the main page right away. Nevermind I found it. Looks great CB! I hope you like the game after tattooing the logo on your arm! Dave - it's on Facebook, Bears Vs Babies shared it themselves even. <url># Woo! Going to see Dr. Strange here in a few minutes! ` Super ultra mega spoilers: <url>"bears vs babies condoms" because... gummies don't belong there.... Dr. P : Bahahahaha! (took me a minute) Seriously, that made my evening. :D Also @Jess - I agree your sonnet's a work of art, you need to put it out there! (Scroll back a couple of hours, anyone who missed it - that should not be missed.) How is this? <url>"Cheetah Cub" Oh no, Zem outed me. Now everyone knows my sinister plan to dominate the Stretch Goals. Seriously though, you should all give yourselves more credit. I am in awe of your creativity and artistic talent. I took the easy way out and found an artist who could make my tattoo dream a reality. ^"Cheetah Cub" The one who did a great job was Derek Crockett, the artist who did the tattoo. I came to him with a Photoshop image and he took it and turned it into a killer tattoo. You should pinch out to enlarge the tattoo so that you can see the bear fur texture he put into the "Bears" part. Those who hadn't submitted a battle scene of a FAMOUS baby vs a FAMOUS bear, do it now!! :) only 2 more of them to unlock another challenge. After that, food sharing and face swap are the closest ones with only 8 left!! And on top of that, less than 2,500 backers to 60,000! Yeah! Only 1 more achievement needed! I don't know about "took one for the team", that sounds like taking a hit. I'd say he manned up (beared up? babied up?) and selfishly took all the credit and honor for himself! ;) He did a great job on it And to answer any questions how we choose what qualifies: we limit the amount of entries, per category, per person. You can do multiple entries per category, but we don't want the count to be over saturated by an individual. If you have any more questions you can email <email> Hey everyone, here is your nightly update: Update: 2 baby tank, 11 pumpkins, 17 food shares, 12 beard babies, 11 art, 17 faceswaps, 8 battle, 2 provokes and of course Cheetahcub graciously took one for the team and unlocked the tattoo achievement. Congratulations, you are 19/20 now, and moving very fast. Hopefully we can get the final one unlocked tomorrow! That's awesome! Sounds like a good tattoo artist! @C! It's my second tattoo, but the previous one (a pair of chili peppers) was over ten years ago. The artist was awesome. He even bought me lunch and we spent all afternoon in conversation getting to know each other. The actual inking took about two hours. It wasn't bad at all. during the outlining, it felt like a bee dancing a waltz around my skin. endorphins kicked in after a while, so the pain wan't all that bad. there were only a couple or three times during the whole process when I needed to do meditation breathing. People who are afraid of the pain just don't understand how important is is to go through all that so that you and the tattoo truly become one. High five for the tattoo! @--C...you're da bomb!! And it's a big one too!! Was that your first ink or do you have more? How was it and how did they convo go with the tattoo artist? How are you feeling now? @Cheetah Cub - then I guess battle scenes must be one per user, or some other quality we are still not aware of. I had hoped hand-drawing them might make them more accepted, but I guess there's still something missing. @Jess: I think they'll have some awesome stuff planned for the end for that, just like last time with the shelter pizza parties and what not! I honestly can't wait to see what they come up with! May the remaining anthems of BvB sing about Cheetah Cub and his badass tattoo!! =D ^"Cheetah Cub" Amanda, those are the official counts from this afternoon. Thanks for updating CubSubCorps! I'm looking forward to the official counts tonight! Might just have all 20 :D Remember, for the provoking babies tasks, those provocations can be pretty benign - like a slice of cake on a plate. ;) ^"Cheetah Cub" New stretch goal counts have been posted on www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html We only need to unlock ONE MORE! @Evan - they haven't had issues with a small number of people doing most of the stuff in the past, but if that is what they are going for, they should probably clarify that as well. Wow CB. Congrats on the new ink. Collectively, all will need the complete remaining time, probably. People can wild guesses what the third round will unlock, given how it worked last time. ;) Is there a bear charity we could give money to? Is there one called the Char-bears? bahahahah...ok just me then? lmao... CHEETAH BUTT FTW!!! I'm so sure that the next round of achievements is gonna be completely nuts. Yes, definately a special breed of backers. :) Should cross 60K backers, soon, shoring up any loose, fiddly tasks. They may just be looking for more people to have submissions overall. One person can't do it all. @CB: YES for the tattoo! Still working on the food shares, I have 2 upcoming and a potential for 3 others. If you guys could provide the 5 others, that would be great! Maybe I'll try that but is parody art, or is art parody? ;) Hmmm, I need one more famous bear and baby, then I'll have 5 battles for today, and if they all count (we really need clarification on that front - what counts?) we would have 10 total and our 20th achievement. @Jess: Write this on beautiful paper and post this on Facebook or Twitter, with a handwritten hashtag. It would HAVE to count as a work of art. It will be MINE! Oh yessssss, it will be MINE! and now for something completely different, real sorry about this, couldn't help myself... :P Not like the beary giant of Smoky fame, With fire extinguisher towed from land to land; Here at our dining and card tables shall stand A mighty ursine with a torch , whose flame Is the napalm firebreath, and it's name Bears vs Babies, a card game. From its chainsaw hand Screams world-wide destruction; its ember eyes command The drink covered table that former friends frame. "Keep, ancient games, your meaningful interaction!" cries he With snarly lips. "Send me your babies, the angry ones Your diapered masses yearning to kamikaze, The wretched creepers of your teeming loins. Send these, the toothless, and swaddled to me, I lift my limbs inside the coliseum!" CB, you're the true hero! Holy Moly! That's dedication! 19 (unofficially) now! HUZZAH FOR CB! ^"Cheetah Cub" I'm back, and here's the promised tattoo: <url>#2 :O Sorry, out and about doing adulting stuff Can't wait to see @--C back in all his glory!! Sorry, dentist, lunch, silly work stuff... I'm here! Sort of... Much adulting to do again Apparently the crew doesn't have to keep the topic up though. They know my weakness: my primary duties as a mattress! Sleep is too important to keep watch! ` Passive ability: ironically, as soon as he gets time to come here and comment, the conversation dies down instantaneously no matter how fast it was going before. Emperor of spam: Spam aura [ongoing ability] +3 bonus to all spammers. Command [acitvate]: once every night, the emperor of spam may command any active crew member to spam with whatever topic the emperor wants It's your ultimate test as the chief of spam, you will become king of spam... no, EMPEROR of SPAM! @Zem lol, that would be funny as all get out. No! Don't tempt me, Aether! The others can attest, I will sit here for 2 hours making up a conversation parodying each and every one of us over dozens of comments! I can't go back there! Not without Epicderpguy at least... ;) Sorry, busy day too. Zem as the chief of spam will cover me... and CB too... and apparently Cha! and everyone else... maybe feign a conversation as if you were all of the crew members?? But yeah, I've just been doing other stuff all day, so I haven't been checking here too regularly, and when I do, I just see no activity and don't post. This morning was so busy, though! Then I get back and can comment now, and suddenly it all stops! Aaah! *scrambles to assemble spam to throw at screen to keep the comments going* ... Um... guys, I might need a new computer. Mine has spam all over it now. @Clayton - I've been noticing the same thing. Just too busy here right now to post more BVB art or songs or things like that. wow, it has been an hour and no comments....and there is not even a baseball game on either...however if @CB forgot his password, that could account for the quietness Oh, I didn't know there was also a newsletter. Elan does a thing on his facebook page called Elan Back Everything, @Venron. <url>"18" today, and maybe more. you're right Dr. P, there are many marks that proves a tattoo's authenticity That, and it's also permanent...... should NOT* Well, it should matter too much Aether if it is a real tattoo. Fresh ones have a distinct look to them with the redness, slight swelling, and freshness of the art. @Tom I think we will get 18 by the end of the day. Maybe 19, because we need only 5 battle scenes to complete that one. Also, maybe they will ask for proof of the tattoo, like pictures of the tattoo while it's been done. (I hope the one who resolves that challenge takes a lot of pictures) Me living in chicago and the cubs winning for the first time in 108 years should be a challenge already, its rocking the usa right now trending everywhere, or make a challenge to make BVB trend on a social media that may be hard i dont think the tattoo challenge is a good one tbh, someone whos very artistic can use sharpie and draw one on their arm, then wash it slightly to fade the ink to make it appeal real. @michael I saw stitches a week ago. Ideas are universal (there's nothing new under the sun as Mike Ross would say) :) I also have a draft of a game that involved making your own monsters with cards, the idea came to me a year ago. So when I saw Bears vs Babies, at first I felt disappointed that the idea was already taken, but before I even finished the video I concluded that the oatmeal and elan lee made a great job with that mechanic and instabacked the project. After that, it was fun to see Stitches, two game with the same mechanic. (Personally, I like BvB the most because of the babies and the mood) Tom the official count is 16 out of 20 still buy I think we're pretty close in a few challenges any closer to the 20 achievements ? EDIT: Dioramas were never my thing... With the creative backers we have I'm surprised they didn't ask for more of them. Hmmm @Quack...let me try to understand that post ahh I think I got it, your autocorrect playin' with you ;) I just looked at the game stitches...wow lol who came up with the idea first? Added 2 more baby face swaps and 2 more famous bear and baby image <url>` Karhu, some sleeep 25 hours/day, some just can't find time to sleep in the middle of their busy crying schedule Karhu it depends on the baby. I can see a fun conversation with my sister in law asking if I can pretend to poke her baby while it's sleeping. Of course, I have no idea how much babies sleep, or this one in particular, or when it sleeps (if it sleeps? I don't know about kids. Do they hibernate?) Yay baby provoking! I would, but no baby here. In may try and post a picture provoking my baby later. Greetings folks. Looks like things are going well. Thanks everyone! If we get the art and 60k today, that would be 20 of them (assuming the two unofficial ones get officialized). We're also close on the famous bvb battle art, and seems like the snapchats are also starting to role in. I agree with Aether's assessment: today feels like a good day. It took me rather a long time to find one that actually worked! Morning @Aether and @Amanda! Loving the songs @Amanda! :) Thanks @Aether, it is a bit strange isn't it! ;) @Amanda yes I just saw/heard them! With that many posts I think you may be helping to unlock the 60k backers by making a lot of BvB noise! (we all, but your posts more) :) :P Btw @Ginger Cub I really liked your face swap! It's creepy and cool haha Agreed Aether - I think we have two unofficially from last night (Battle flags and babies as bears). Hoping we also get the art today. I've added four this morning (three songs and one drawing). Morning everyone! Today is gonna be a good day, I feel we are going to unlock at least two challenges :) Getting set to upload three more Bears vs Babies Songs! Far too early in the morning for my tastes, but up for good reason beyond just adulting. I know that feeling. Not a fan of adulting, but at least this is helping to offset it slightly! It's going, just adulting for the most part. Hi @Dr.P! Been a pretty long day at work so far, looking forward to 5pm! How's life with you? @Dr. P, so far so good, my first day back at work today after a week and a half off, just duckin' and coverin'... ;) Good "Morning" all! How goes it? Morning again Zem! As you can see, you missed a lot while you were asleep... @Zem, and good morning to you too! >.> It didn't work. I woke up. Why, life? Why do you have to exist? Iko Iko? (*KeroKero*) Haha, well it's 8:30 here, happy to take the torch and look after the comments! Just "accidentally" turn off your alarm... It's only 3:30, of course I'm still here! Though now my soul can rest in peace knowing that you can take the torch and continue the comment marathon. Not like that. It'll rest in peace in bed. And with any luck, I'll sleep even through my other class tomorrow, but not quite through a meeting! Just gotta learn how to not hear an alarm while asleep... Morning/night Zem (if you're still there!) See what happens when you guys aren't here for me to say goodnight to 13 times in a row? I end up saying it to myself all night and never go to sleep! It's 3:24 now! ` Then again... I AM keeping up the comments all by myself again... Oh yeah, sleep! Someone needs to remind me! It's 3 am, and I'll only get 4 hours of sleep! Eh, if I skip recitation (again), I'll get an extra hour and a half, and it's just after an exam and will cover stuff I already know well, but I don't like being *that* guy and just skipping, especially since I did last week. Dilemmas... Not much of a dilemma when it means an extra hour and a half of sleep, is it? Sorry to keep you up so long, Aether! I completely forgot to sleep myself! And eat... dang, it's just one of those days, huh? Hooray! I can go to sleep now Oh yeah, I was going to do that, wasn't I?! I've stayed up till 2 am NOT doing what I was supposed to... Oh well, it's a thing. ` I am not messing up the covers. Sliding in so as not to wrinkle all the sheets making sure the quilt stays nice and clean Have you ever seen a bed so neat? I'm getting intooo bed! ... sleepsleepsleeptimetogotosleepnow itisnightandineedtosleepwhileitisdark iamreallytiredtimeforsleep nowtiredtiredsleepsleepsleep I'm getting into bed! Cubs win world series. Cubs are baby bears. Bears vs babies confirmed. End of a great night with Zem singing *the* song. Fine by me! I swear to god the end of the world is coming. DiCaprio with an Oscar, Cubbies won the World Series and Disney is releasing The Incredibles 2! Aaw, unfortunately, Cha, that's not an MLP fan-parody nor a song from MLP, so it doesn't apply since the tradition was set a few days ago. I have to do something now, but when I'm done... *sigh* I guess I have to sing it again! ;) Oh I see!! I guess I'll google it to understand the background better. Thanks for the explanation Zem! Sorry not been able to comment and drop some tunes today and now I I Have To Go To Sleep Song <url>"Cheetah Cub" Go BvB Go. Go BvB Go. Hey KickStarter what do you say? The CubSub crew is here to stay. It's been an eventful day for BvB and the Cubs!! Congrats Cubs!! :) ^"Cheetah Cub" Go Cubs Go. Go Cubs Go. Hey Chicago what do you say? The Cubs are gonna win today! Aether, this is the biggest event and one of the most incredible and surprising outcomes in sports history. Probably the most major event in half a century, though that may be stretching it only a tiny bit. And yes, even bigger than the 7-1 win of a European team over Brazil in its home country last FIFA, though that was also VERY epic! chicago going to be going nuts. stay off the roads in the city. for a challenge one should be for the cubs to win. after all its been 108 years so we gotta celebrate some how @CB that was a great game to cap a great season to end a historic 108 year drought. Gotta say, it's great to be a Cubs fan! ^"Cheetah Cub" @Aether, It's epic. Congrats! not sure about the magnitude of this but sounds like it is something to be proud of! ^"Cheetah Cub" I even played a part in a community theater production of "Bleacher Bums." ^"Cheetah Cub" I grew up in Davenport, Iowa, which is a part of "Greater Chicagoland!" whos from chicago here i for sure am CUBS WIN! ^"Cheetah Cub" @Yohannon, +1 ^"Cheetah Cub" Look at that. Suddenly I can spam these comments all by myself. So we watched it happen, and I exclaim to the tribe: "Wow, a whole lot of jokes just lost a punchline." And Back to the Future missed it by only a year! ^"Cheetah Cub" Now I can wear my "Respect Chicago" shirt all year. ^"Cheetah Cub" It's a new world. It was exciting just existing during that game! Although you can't have something that tense without scripting it! That had to be a paid game, probably entire series. WOO CUBS ^"Cheetah Cub" Go Cubs Go! ^"Cheetah Cub" I've been waiting Sooooooo long to say that! #FlyTheW ^"Cheetah Cub" CHICAGO CUBS WIN WORLD SERIES ^"Cheetah Cub" I just re-read your post. The goal isn't for 5 separate pictures. All 5 have to be in one picture for it to count. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Jordan Adams, feel free to be the first to post that picture. How do we not have 5 pictures of people dressed up yet for the stretch goal? Though if the Canucks keep their current game as is I might have to jump ship Glad the delay is over... I was preparing to keep comments flowing ^"Cheetah Cub" Blue Jays eww I became a fan of the Penguins, who won the Stanley cup weeks later =) and saw a game of the Pirates, the mood of a baseball game is incredibly fun! Blackhawks eww ^"Cheetah Cub" @House Arrest, I'm only interested in hockey when the Blackhawks are in the Stanley Cup playoffs. In my country baseball and hockey are not sports with too much audience but when I went to Pittsburgh in May I went to a baseball game and a hockey game too. Loved both ^"Cheetah Cub" Whew, the rain delay only lasted 17 minutes. I too am watching the game but as a hockey loving Canadian, baseball is just so boring ^"Cheetah Cub" The World Series is currently in a rain delay at the top of the 10th inning of Game 7. Looks like it could be a long night for me. Please keep the comments coming so that I can stay awake. Please ... Looks like it's back to songwriting tomorrow for me! Glad the banners/art is going well (although I'm slightly confused by the flags/battle official count) Super happy about the last baby as a bear though! :D think its time to announce the 3rd goal ^"Cheetah Cub" How in the world do you do the Snapchat thing? Do they have a username for that? I searched on bersvsbabies and got bupkus. ^"Cheetah Cub" ... And one more time with the "maybes" www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html ^"Cheetah Cub" Oh sure, no updates for a long time and then you sneak another one in as I'm updating. JK, Updated. ;-) ^"Cheetah Cub" Thanks, @Aether. Your totals are posted. www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html Indeed, I thought I wrote the flags too but I didn't, thanks @Karhu since Ashley's update, two new flags were uploaded, if both are accepted then we will have all 10 and 0 to go @AT I think my bear flag might have gotten us to 10 if they accepted all the ones Amanda posted earlier in the evening. Sure @CB! Since Ashley's update the following things have changed for the unofficial count: 25 babies as bears - 0 to go 8 beard babies - 17 to go 9 face swaps - 16 to go 1 provoke - 24 to go ^"Cheetah Cub" After 4 innings: Chicago 3, Cleveland 1 ^"Cheetah Cub" I finally got to use my "maybe" font for that one. www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html ^"Cheetah Cub" @Aether, do you have an update on the unofficial count? Looks like we might get the bear disguise task with that photo. Hopefully that'll finish that one off. I can't believe we have gotten any poking babies pics yet maybe this new baby posted by @aftercredits will unlock the baby as bears achievement <url>"Cheetah Cub" New totals posted. We're crushing it! LOL added another sharing one on FB Hey there! Lots of things happening today. Here is your nightly update: 2 baby tank, 11 pumpkins, 14 food shares, 24 babies as bears, 7 beard babies, 7 art, 7 faceswaps, 8 flags, 5 battle. Looking forward to seeing the brave person who gets a tattoo. (If its not listed its either already achieved, or not started. You can check the chart to tell the difference) Good job guys! Hell yeah! And yeah, my mom has all 8 Fresh Aires and pretty much everything from Mannheim Steamroller, many on original records, but the entire thing for sure on CDs. ^"Cheetah Cub" I have Fresh Aire 1 through 7. Love that music! (btw, the Cubs just scored a lead-off home run.) Good point, CB. The other tour, with the rest of Chip Davis' discography. Funny thing is my dad actually knew him when he worked in Omaha. He knew him when he was still doing just smaller, local stuff, so when Convoy and Fresh Aire exploded and made Chip famous, it blew everyone away to see him suddenly so successful! ^"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, the Christmas tour IS Mannheim Steamroller's "normal" tour. I went to it when I lived in Sioux City. yeah, am planning on doing some actual decorated cookies, but i just haven't had much free time at all. Creeper, I was wondering how long it'd take you to make some really awesome food! I would think half of the food ones would be you! ;) Woo! My parents got my family tickets to the Mannheim Steamroller Christmas tour this december! I've never been to a show, and they're usually sold out instantly, but everyone who can make it says it's the best show they've ever been to, except perhaps the normal Mannheim Steamroller tours. But all the best, some of the most famous and popular christmas music of all time! Dang, judging by my rambling, I can't wait to see this! @Amanda - sounds like a good plan! Bedtime for me now though, 11:30pm where I am. Looking forward to seeing how you're all doing tomorrow (and hopefully doing my part too!) :) @Steff Thanks! Yeah, I've been having a long week, so I needed a break anyway. This was fun :) Maybe if I get done with the rest of my adulting, I can take another BvB break. @Amanda - Good plan, you're doing great :) Unfortunately I left all my adulting to today and tomorrow, and then my parents are visiting for the weekend. I'm hoping I'll be able to squeeze in an hour tomorrow. ^"Cheetah Cub" -- Looks up at the top of the screen after a flurry of updates. -- Hey! We're over $2 Million! @Steff - I know the feeling. I've been adulting all week, so I set aside an hour or so today to work on these. Fortunately parodies come easily to me (and quick turnaround means I can't over-think how awful my voice is) Urgh I have so much adulting to do. You guys are doing great though! Hopefully I'll get some time to contribute tomorrow! Buying that edible printer has worked wonders.... They do look amazing! Excellent work! Just saw it! That looks amazing! No! That sounds awesome Melissa! Did you guys see the oreo bars I sent the EK crew? Woo! Thanks for all the hard work! All right, that concludes my posting spree. Several songs, war banners, and works of art are now updated. Should only need one more war banner to unlock the achievement, assuming the ones my fiance and I posted are good. Good luck with the tattoo! ^"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, nope no EK tattoo. I did spend some time cleaning up the BvB text to make it more "tattoo friendly" though. I'm going to try to find a tattoo artist tomorrow who can get the job done for me. No promises until I actually get it done though. ^"Cheetah Cub" Things get busy and suddenly everyone's a critic! Thanks for the correction on remaining counts though, @Aether. Good catch. And now there's 16 achievements unlocked. Just posted three songs to twitter... off-key tone-deaf singing voice included free of charge! CB, I don't blame you. If I had a way to watch, even I'd be watching that game today! Do you have an EK tattoo to put it next to or something, though? You need a matching set of tattoos if you're going to get it! I'm surprised we haven't gotten 5 people dressed as bears or babies... Grumpy cat is grumpy.... AF. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Steven Faddis, I'm doing my best to keep up, geez! Give me a break, will ya? ^"Cheetah Cub" Dang! I'd totally go out and get the tattoo TONIGHT if I wasn't watching Game 7 of the World Series! ^"Cheetah Cub" @onathan Lord von Haßlau, I don't count 'em, I just report 'em. @CB great work updating the cubsubcorps stretch goals page! Thanks! I noticed that the "remaining" tab for some categories remained unchanged food shares: 12 to go Bearded babies: 19 to go @Zem Always glad to be of help! Now you see why my parents have called me "Professor" since I was a little kid! Being around me is a constant learning experience. Karhu, that just blew my mind. I learned more just now than in all my classes today! ;) It's usually a pretty good indicator, though there's always that last-second pledge surge it can't account for, and judging by this campaign's relation to Exploding Kittens, it should be a pretty big boost, though not quite as much. @zem Yep, Bjorn is the Norwegian (and Old Norse) word for bear! According to Kicktraq, we're on schedule to hit just under 4 000 000 000$ when this is all over. Karhu, wait, Bjorn means Bear?! Wow, all this time I had no clue that's what that name means! 2 million! WOOO! @Gaz - should be able to go into your account settings and opt-out of updates or Kick-Starter news-letters, by clicking and opting-out in the referral link contained with, if you want. broke that 2 million well done. That's more of a kickstarter thing for the most part. Would you stop sending me emails, I've already bought your game you evil wizard. I have a sneaky suspicion that Pooh Bear could lay some serious smack down, if the supply of Honey Pots were somehow threatened. I made a bear war banner but I'll have to wait until I get home to take a picture and post it. The writing on it is in Norwegian, but I think they will be okay with it! It says "BJØRNER MOT BABYER" with a stylised bear's head in the middle. Has anyone done Winnie the Pooh versus Tommy Pickles(Rugrats baby)? So the Cub Sub page has us at 15, the campaign has us at 16. What the frig guys lol And it looks like we will likely reach 60K+ backers, unlocking at least one more task by default , perhaps even the 70K+ one. Yes, you can help keep the party going by just pledging, for those who were stressing over such things. :P Anyway, our counts aren't official but do come with a reasonable degree of accuracy. It is up to them if they choose to accept them or not. (They do have to be famous so there is still that criteria.) Or maybe it's six.... it's been a long day -.- Hello Cubsubians...today has been one of those days... On a happier note, yay to unlocking the first goal, and the flood of awesome contributions for the next one!! Oh, and making it past 2mil and a lot of new backers :) lol I am loving those ones though.... That must be it, I count four on twitter. But there are fresh ones since the count. Just did two war banners. More incoming! GM, Dang it! I had to open my mouth! No, open my keyboard?... type some... uh... I just had to press buttons, sending electric signals to a computer that then processed them sequentially into arbitrarily linked passages of information that you could then read from your computer via the magic of the internet! Maybe we just need to refresh the search Jonathan. (GM, this is also one that IS photoshoppable like the movie one before) @Jonathan: I haven't looked at them myself, but it could be a few things. They could be the same(or too similar to be possible different ones), they could be missing the note with the #BEARSvsBABIES on it, or some other criteria that the judges are deciding doesn't meet a certain standard. @Cheetah: How can there be only 1 confirmed BearVsBaby-fight scene? Any Idea, what we exactly need to do to complete that one? Cause i've seen way more than 1 image... @Zem: And now they have no chance thanks to your last comment. Oh wow. OH WOW! I forgot to check the world series progress since the game before last, but 3-3, last game today?! Holy cow, the Cubs can actually win! ^Thanks Cheetah-Cub , for keeping up with all of that. ^ Yup. ^=^ ^"Cheetah Cub" New stretch goal totals hae been posted. www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html In the end though there are more than enougj things to complete without it to move forward at present. Honestly Peter, I think it is kind of a throw away gag. They just want to see what people co.e up with to complete it so henna may be fine. Just a bonus if someone really gets one. . . They would have to clarify that to be certain though. With the tatoo, it doesn't specially say if it had to be temporary or permanent though right? And even if it is permanent, would the creators know if someone did a temporary? @Peter: Provided there is enough snow, that would be possible. But as is, at least around here, there really isn't much except on the ski hills out in the mountains(~1.5+ hour drive away). Even then, you would need it to melt some, then freeze overnight, spending multiple days up there(and it's not that cheap to begin with, and with the recent price hike they implemented, even less cheap than before). Not sure if the hill helps or hurts.... A snow/ice sculpture is a fantastic idea for any that can do it. Hey guys. I just thought of an idea for the baby monster. It's a little far fetched and requires quite a bit of effort I guess, but if anyone is willing, I guess give it a try. I was thinking about the 20ft baby monster. Here's one way I guess it could be achieved. Since it's 20ft, I would suggest a place with snow on a hill. Somehow I guess you would start building a regular snowman, stacking snow on top of each other into a 20ft humanoid shape. The base would have to be big and round. Then after it freezes, (does it freeze? I've never built a snowman and I'm just going off some basic physics), we begin the next phase. We could start adding body parts to it. Like it the achievements icon, it has tons of boobs. So we could add tons of boobs, maybe a few protruding eyeballs on the head, whatever you want I guess. The next phase I guess is editing? You could use wet toilet paper and wrap it around the base. The base I mentioned had to be big not only for support, but also give an image of a poop filled nappy, so keep that in mind. Anyway, so you wrap toilet paper around the bottom trying to form some poop filled nappy, then you could start using paint, but I suggest food colouring to dye the snow giving some detail. Maybe some brown for poop stains, Black eyes, Red blood dripping from the mouth, Green snot from the nose or just oozing out of the body or boobs. Yeh similar colouring thoughts. From their I guess the only thing I could think of is shoving a few sticks into the side of the snowman. Then you start put trash or whatever on the sticks. Maybe more dyed tissue. But yeh, decorate the sticks to make it look trashy or gross, somehow I guess. And I guess that would be sufficient for a baby monster. Again it's just a thought, but maybe someone could use it. :) Maybe if we do enough really good henna they'll let it slide on the low.... or we'll have a crazy awesome fan do it. that stinks :( I think only permanent tattoos count because we only need one to do it. If temporary counted, they'd have like 25 tattoos needed. I just tweeted a bear Haiku for you :D I am trying to get my husband to make me a temp tattoo LOL hopefully it will count hello all! Yayy!! We rock! Hooray for goal one! Working on banners and art for goal two! @PC: Could always order a second set, and see what it is. ^^^^Attention Bears vs. Babies Shoppers^^^^ Stretch-Goal # 1 has been unlocked. All pledges for the CORE or CORE + NSFW deck/s will have their CORE deck upgraded to 112 cards. I wonder if one of the stretch-goal itemshas has a texture of raised ridges .... like a bear. Probably won't open the pack to find out. Them is collectable. ;) @DP tattoo is spelled wrong? I thought it was supposed to be t-a-t-t-o-o. Did anyone else notice that Tattoo is spelled wrong? That could be a technicality Allison, it's really on them though. I think that one is also a gag.... I made a shield a few years back with a bear's head on the front of it. I wonder if they would count that? It was a coffin shield, sort of in the form of an ancient Celtic shield. I was wondering if a henna tattoo would work Does drawing on your self with coloured sharpies count for a tattoo? Anyone know how to make temporary tattoos? Kinda thought we would have gotten the sculpture one by know Yay for round one unlock! Onwards to round two ^"Cheetah Cub" www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html has been updated with the Wiki Page and the Diorama. Still waiting for one of the graphics, but the numbers are correct. *BREAKING NEWS* STRETCH-GOAL NUMBER 1 HAS BEEN UNLOCKED. (Everyones base deck has been upgraded to 112 cards - yeah!) I kind of want a category for "team anthems." I suck at that kind of a thing, but it sounds like fun. It's also still like 11am where they are, so do give them a little patience. They probably haven't even had lunch yet. I should be able to create a bear army banner when I get home from work tonight. Dependss if they want to do a quick update or Lee and Mike are going to collaborate on some graphics to go along with. Probably see it by tommorrow if they hadn't already cooked up sumptin' :) The wiki page is definitely functioning: <url>"Art of the Mattress", huh? It's a talent all us Mattresses inherently have. I am not messing up the covers... Cha!, nah, when I go to sleep, it really is more like the "I'm getting into bed" one! ;) not sure if this counts for the famous babies battling famous bears but I had to try: <url>#3 is actually worth it! Yep, soso like @Zem :) MLP - Hush Now Lullaby Song <url>` Though with cardstock, I don't know what everyone complains about. I've had no problems with the Exploding Kittens cards, and trust me, they're well used at this point. None of them ripped or bent or split, no major marks or mars. Are you guys playing with babies that gnaw on the cards or something? @Quack...good night! And if you can't be a Bear, be a Viking Vikings - FeHu (war song) <url>"Abeartion Guide" for those cases where the condom ripped? @Tom...take a look at this one: <url>"No, I'm not 18 yet, I can't be on this site!" button? Then didn't we get the second goal then . It says complete any one. If the wiki is made we reached the goal Bearth Control? Hey, why would you need to control the berth? That's my job! I'm the Sub Berth! ^"Cheetah Cub" @Tom, thanks for the shoutout, but a Wiki page doesn't need any web development. It needs a knowledgeable person with a flair for writing. Besides, it looks like someone has already beaten me to it. With all of the work I just did with the Stretch Goals page, BvB already keeps me pretty busy, so I'm glad someone else volunteered for the task. So we only have to do one of the new achievements? Let's get that wiki page going @Bruno... awesome awesome Lego creations! @Tom I know the exaggeration is intended to be a joke (35+) but still, I think at some point it displays that it is for grown ups. Also, on the campaign section there's another note saying that it's not kid-friendly. You are right about kids with liberty, though, but Quack got a point too. You got a point Tom if a kid has free range to be on this site and pledge with his parents card then they probably know plenty about condoms anyway...besides condoms aren't age restricted items...in theory a 7yo could walk into a corner store and buy some. @Aether I think the 35+ is more or so a joke. But it's still the point a 10 year old could easily pledge for it if he has his parents card on his account. I still want the condom tho. It's a funny addition The wikipage is already done =) it only needs a lot of information more ... I just realized I'm 9 years away from the NSFW booster ... @Mike. Knowing you made cubsubcorp you should make the wiki page @Tom I get your point. But the condom is included in the NSFW booster which has a "(Ages 35+)" label on the reward tier Don't get me wrong. The condom is a great addition. But you should only do that if the buyer is 18+ cause what if a littler kid orders it.? Aether I wouldn't feel bad...as I recall from Exploding Kittens people would comment like every hour requesting sleeves ^Horrid grammar FTW. Should have read more "Dick and Jane", as a wee small one, I guess. Guys, with the 5 people dressed as bears or babies goal.. you basicly just need to get your family and a cople friends, dressed up and involvedinvolved. There are no age specifications, a couple could be actual babies.. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Aether, no need to apologize. Some people are just fine with sleeved cards, just not me. ^"Cheetah Cub" btw, the World Series is going to Game 7! #FlyTheW Go Cubs Go! Thanks @CB your work is much appreciated! Also, have to apologize for a comment regarding sleeves for cards I said earlier. Saw your post about the reasons for not using sleeves and I think those are good reasons :) Yea that Wiki is up fair enough...I had thought you were doing unofficial running tallies before. ^"Cheetah Cub" Looks like we might have already knocked off the Wiki Page, too. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Dave, I'll probably wait for @Aether to post a new unofficial count or BvB to post an official count. It's confusing enough already. CB I recently submitted a sculpture so our count should be to 24 sculptures That's true Zem I would have been way more surprised if someone HADN'T made a wiki yet! Freebie! ^"Cheetah Cub" *Whew* That was a workout! New stretch goal totals are posted on www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html I was about to say someone made the wiki. Did you do that Niki? <url>#bearsvsbabies @Quack...it works!! :) Thanks Cha! That was a last min touch I couldn't think of something for a diaper till that popped in my head I think they want a famous bear and a famous baby...i.e. Yogi Bear and Bam Bam from the Flinstones(I couldn't think of any examples from "real life") I also have doubts about the famous battle scenes. Is it something like exchanging Harry Potter for a bear and Voldemort for a baby?? (With photoshop) With these new goals, I think we can easily achieve 5 more by Friday and maybe 10 by Sunday :) @Quack...most awesome laser ptero baby sculpture!! Love the leaf touch ;) Brian it keeps things interesting while the campaign runs. Most people have fun doing them. Just look at all the photos and see all the crazy creativity that is coming out of these stretch goals. @Quack... no worries :) I wasn't aware I had done anything grieviously against you that would have warranted a block. I always try not to make an ass(out of)u(or(me) I kinda thought that pledging was enough. Hey Zem! Wow, even though it's a bit late for most people, or too early for others, this inspired alot of great activity! ` Also, Hi, Dave! That would have been hilarious to have to create Bears vs Babies condom slogans. Hey can still integrate in your diaramas, posters, art :) You were blocked Cha...I have no idea how that happened! You are now unblocked and should be able to see it. MANY APPOLOGIES Ms. Cha! Those condoms are awesome and hilarious!! I'm glad they are part of the stretch-goals-rewards-to-get and not part of the stretch-goals-tasks-to-do xD It looks like you blocked me, that's what Twitter says :( Yes I saw it and I really liked it! :) those laser babies are the best Aside from Allison I know Aether Tower saw it since they liked my tweet. I wonder why you can't Cha @Quack... Ashley from the BvB team posted our current numbers earlier: Ashley Collaborator about 2 hours ago Hello everyone! Here is your afternoon update: 2 baby tank, 10 pumpkins, 12 food shares, 21 babies as bears, 6 beard babies, and 23 sculptures. You guys are so so close unlocking sculptures and babies as bears. Keep up the great work! strange... The official count said we needed 2 more sculptures!! Also you can call me Quack @Dave...can't see it :( it says I'm blocked from seeing content The cub sub count says we need two more Are the numbers for the achievements rights? Awesome Dave then we should have that one finished! Nice update! Also I just submitted my Laser Ptero Baby: <url>"Cheetah Cub" So ... I'm confused ... 50,000 backers counts as one of the 15 for Stretch Goal 1? Yes deliciously crazily creatively odd stretch goals!! :) Wait, what uhm I ALWAYS wanted to get Bears vs Babies condoms ;) Odd SG Looking forward to crazy good songs, videos, posters, works of art!! Looks like a photoshop challenge I don't have snapchat, might have to get it Hmmm is the famous Bear vs famous Baby battle scene a photo shop type challenge? Calling all Snapchatters!! I loved making diaramas in school, looking forward to being able to do that one Ha @House Arrest...*highfives* Our sculptureperts should be able to kill that diarama stretch goal. Just reuse (the non edible eeh) creations to create a Bears vs Babies scene!! I need to find another figure I can sculpt, I have limited colours of clay Two more, two more!! Sculptures (2 more needed) and Babies as Bears (4 more needed) are in our reach! Let's do it!! lol I just looked at the future stretch goal tasks and what we'll get They added 2 number of backers stretch goals and it looks like the 50k is counting towards the 15 we need to unlock the first stretch goal reward as it says 13 unlocked! Uhm hello future as of yet not unlocked stretch goals... Check campaign page...something to look forward to and think about and start on while getting those few missing first batch stretch goals unlocked! Seriously, there may literally be riots...... @Dr.P... I think I'll be working from home tomorrow. I hope that strike will be over by end of week latest!! @Zem...thank you for making me remember Scatman John, been listening to all his songs. They're always making me happier. :) Well, text talking doesn't exactly carry a tone either. ^"Cheetah Cub" Thanks @Cody. No offense intended. I appear to be making a lot of people angry today. I'm glad that you're not one of them. Yeah, it ducking does that. I hate auto correct it's supposed to say the update... not ghetto update.... @cheetah cub, I was off on the amount total. I type in MS Word and copy and paste. So my brain rounded $1.9million to 2, without me double checking before I posted. I will say I look forward to seeing ghetto update. A double dose of jazzy music I love Scatman John - Scatman (Jazz Level) <url>#bearsvsbabies) in your submissions!! So they are valid and eligible to be counted!! So that we can unlock this stretch goal batch!! So that we can get excited about the next stretch goal batch!! So that we all live happily ever after!! :) Really, CB? That's crazy! I make a point to get at least SOME amount of sleep before an exam, preferably an amount of hours that needs 2 hands to be counted on, but sometimes it doesn't work out that way. CB, the the fact that that fact statement was indeed a joke, and about as good of grammar as my sleep-deprived mind could manifest. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, that reminds me of the time I was in college, studied all night for an exam and tried to take a 20 minute cat nap. I wound up arriving 30 minutes late for the exam, but aced it any way. Cody, I can say now, though, that if you're staying for updates, we've been relaying concerns here to the team, so in the next update, we've requested that they address several of them. So hopefully this isn't all for naught and you'll better be able to make your decision soon! Hey, Ashley! Thanks! Me, a couple hours ago: "I have an exam in 2 hours 20 minutes, but I could sleep that time and do better than if I just studied the whole time seeing as I got like 4 hours and 45 minutes of sleep. " ... I DID NOT ACTUALLY WANT TO TRY THAT! I just wanted a quick, half hour nap! I pushed it back 10 minutes after it went off, and then 10 more, but for some reason it didn't go off the third time, and I woke up with just enough time to get there and review a tiny bit. Thankfully most of the stuff on this Calc exam was logical and I remembered all the formulas I needed to! I can't believe my body took me seriously and slept exactly as long as it could! ^"Cheetah Cub" Sorry, @Dr. P. Just fact checking. I wasn't questioning @Cody's opinion. Great layout CB! ^"Cheetah Cub" New stretch goal counts are posted. www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html Thanks, Ashley!! OK everyone, time to re-carve your pumpkins (on the back) before they rot.... HUZZAH! Official update! Hello everyone! Here is your afternoon update: 2 baby tank, 10 pumpkins, 12 food shares, 21 babies as bears, 6 beard babies, and 23 sculptures. You guys are so so close unlocking sculptures and babies as bears. Keep up the great work! great @Krzysiek one pic at a time and we will achieve this round and the others! SEPTA being on strike sucks... Love it! Right so....gummy bears vs jelly babies posted on fb. My 5 cents worth is done! Dave the quack! Hello!! Hope you're well! Oh, you got quite is all Cody. Also CB let's not be incendiary, he is allowed his opinion. He feels a certain way, and that is fine even if seome disagrees. Oooo - I see @Elan dropped by for some comment love. Very exciting :]] ^"Cheetah Cub" @Cody, why do you feel the need to exaggerate in order to make your point? You say that this campaign has made over $2 Million when in fact, it has yet to reach that milestone. Perhaps I misunderstood you though. Were you referring to Exploding Kittens instead? Didn't rage quite Micah, I just have a full time job and was working. I'm currently backing at the $1 level so I can see updates that might change my mind, but as it currently stands I'll probably bow out before the end. If there's anything that I said that you'd like clarified, let me know, and I'd be happy make myself clear though. hopefully we made the goals :) waiting with hope for the update :) @Gm I got ya back on this one. heading for 2 million. ^"Cheetah Cub" @GM, that depends on whether you're strictly considering grammar without any concern for readability. ... Anyway, it was meant to be a joke. @CB: There isn't anything wrong with the way that that sentence is worded. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, not to mention the fact that you just used the phrase the fact that that fact ... Now to sleep, THEN to study! I have an exam in 2 hours 20 minutes, but I could sleep that time and do better than if I just studied the whole time seeing as I got like 4 hours and 45 minutes of sleep. Wow, I only got twice as much sleep as time left till the exam... the fact that that fact is surprising to me means I could use a nap! ;) ^"Cheetah Cub" @Tom Karbowski, don't jump the gun. Elan's comment doesn't say that we've achieved Stretch Goal 1 yet. It only states that they'll reveal the next batch of achievements needed for future stretch goals in their next update. Keep working on those remaining entries until we get official word that stretch goal 1 has been achieved. Well, it says soon not today to be fair. It did (It's only like 15-20 comments down but to elaborate:) . Elan Lee 2-time creator Superbacker about 2 hours ago Hey guys. You're doing amazing job on the achievements! We'll post an update with the next batch soon...We're just double checking we don't introduce anything that will slow down production of the actual game. I Wanted to chime in quickly on the "print and play" rules idea. I'm really excited to get the rules and prototype decks into your hands ASAP. That's exactly the plan after the campaign when we have our final list of backers. We'll be sending early versions of the game to a few hundred playtest parties to show you what we've got, ask some questions, and get your help with the final touches. (rules for hosting parties will be posted after the campaign) I'm really proud of this game. We build and test it every night, and it continues to improve. It's fun and funny and has amazing strategy. But I still think it can be better. That's what we'll need your help with...in fact, that's the whole reason we're here instead of putting this straight onto store shelves. Was his comment pointing towards an update Today Not sure if we're quite there, or if we're just REALLY close. Or if they're unlocking stuff early? We'll have to see in the update. So we reached the first goal Did you listen to it, Cha? If you hadn't, it's amazing. If you had, it's amazing! Cha, I don't listen to it on my own normally, but Jon Benjamin is a jazz genius! In his own words, raw, unfiltered untalent! Looks like we're doing well folks. Keep up the good work. I may try and do a sculpture later(no judging my artistic "skill") and maybe a good share. Gummy bears ftw Elan update below!!!!!! (about 10-15 comments down) @Zem... didn't know you liked jazz :) And wait, there's more! H. Jon Benjamin - I can't play piano, Pt. 2 <url># For uhuhu @Zem :) H. Jon Benjamin - I can't play piano, Pt. 1 <url>` Dr. P, that's why I commented so much and so long last night. I was walking all around the right words. You said them better, and I tidied some up today, so it mostly works out in the end except that they might not see the good answers now Elan update below!!!!!! . . What are you going on about Bryan. Don't just be a negative ninnie (no I meant ninnie, I know some awesome Nancys), elaborate! What more do you want to see, what veil that I'm not seeing do you want to lift and peer under? Hey, Cha!, here's some amazing jazz from the guy who voiced Bob in Bob's Burgers and Archer in Archer! You should add this to your playlists! Look up Jon Benjamin, Well I Should Have.... My favorite is "I can't play piano." There hopefully that will make a few people happy! Some people are pretty great sucking up to creators, why? They are making a product but since we are investing in said product transparency is always nice HUZZAH! What other things do people want to see? I can't just be talking to myself all the time after all. I hope there is a backer testing thing like last time too! If there is, then there will be a general guideline and an answer to all such questions wrapped up in the awesome-sauce that is one of the greatest ways to get backers involved with a product ever! @Zem: Everyone has horrible days, and I HATE it when I can't find the words to express what I mean. That is incredibly frustrating, often for everyone in a conversation if not more so for the individual. ^"Cheetah Cub" @T.J. I agree with your request for print-and-play rules. ^"Cheetah Cub" Your totals agree with the official count, @Dr.P. That means we need 23 more tank babies, 17 more pumpkins, 15 more food shares, 7 more babies as bears, 21 more beard babies, and only 2 more sculptures. Remember, we only need 3 more of these to get the stretch goal. Thanks Dr. P & @CB for the count update! @Felix - someone just addressed the comment issue today and has compiled a list of the Creator's comments (just scroll down a bit, it was posted about an hour ago). Also, I can see your point about the "doability". I didn't think these were out of line given the response to the EK challenges, but there's just a smaller group (so far) getting involved in that aspect of things. Well stated T.J.! Oh, CB beat me to it! Unless my numbers are backwards we have currently completed the following for the remaining tasks: 2 baby tank, 8 pumpkins, 10 food shares, 18 babies as bears, 4 beard babies, and 23 sculptures ^"Cheetah Cub" New stretch goal totals posted. Only 2 sculptures left. www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html FWIW, I think social stretch goals make sense in raising visibility of the project with fun posts on social networks. They can be fun. The problem is when people don't complete them and a project like this goes stagnant despite financial success. If you want to encourage heavy involvement and activity from your backers, it helps when the people running the campaign are active and involved as well. We have two updates in two weeks and very few responses for 4,500 comments. As someone who backs a lot of board/card games, the standard is to come to Kickstarter with some print-and-play rules and some gameplay videos so backers get a good feel for the game and whether or not it will be fun. If this didn't have name recognition behind it, it would be universally blasted for a $35 price tag for 100 cards. And if it was anyone else, it would be universally blasted for lack of updates, lack of unlocked stretch goals at $1.9 million, etc. Elan Lee and Matt/Oatmeal need to decide how they are going to move things forward since the campaign hit a wall with the social stretch goals. Surely they went into this campaign assuming they'd make tons of money and that they'd expand the game with stretch goals. @Felix: From what I understand, the reason they are being very nit picky(as you said), is because there are LOTS of people just searching google for anything that fits the achievements, and submitting those. Unfortunately, none of those pictures include a hand written note that has the #BEARSvsBABIES on it. It's too easy to manipulate a digital version, so they are being very critical of it since if they accepted just any old picture, with a photoshopped tag, all the goals would be done in seconds. Excellent comment felix! We do gab a lot, but we try to keep people in the loop about such things too. If you have a question you CAN ask us and we might really actually know an answer. When there is an update we will scream about it to the world, and makes sure everyone has a place they can go to read such things if it becomes hard to find here. The pumpking babies got updated on the campaign page as complete, and the other I think we're waiting on a number (we're poking around and finding one, and will inform you when we have it. Our numbers do run close [-/+ 3 usually] so they do give a decent gauge.) So speaking of goals - any word on the BvB themed pumpkins goal? I haven't been able to check whether those were being posted yesterday, but might find time to carve the backs of a couple of pumpkins at home if we still need counts. I don't disagree with both points of view (social vs monetary sg) but I feel that the sg should be more balanced in the sense that they should be more doable than this and with increasing difficulty as it goes up. It's been a while now and no sg unlocked yet. And from the feel I get they are really nit picking on the entries. Also I really don't see the creator active in the comments or updates. Either that or you guys are drowning the comments and I don't see him.. hahahaha. And I am just saying this by comparing it to exploding kittens and not other companies. I know that it's not required to have sgs but at the same time if you don't and it's this successful I might as well wait for the retail version and pay for it then. Anyways, going to keep waiting and seeing how it develops. Just putting my 2 cents since the messages I see give me the feel that a few of you are putting the concerns of others down. Just because you feel you are right does not mean someone else is wrong. ^"Cheetah Cub" Other campaigns offer stretch goals or getting a certain number of Twitter followers or Facebook posts. There's not all that much difference between that and posting a themed photo on social media. The difference is that most people ignore the traditional "back this project" tweet or post, but more people will pay attention to an amusing photo or haiku. That's why so many of us here consider the stretch goals to be a bit of marketing genius. As everyone can tell, a few people do not enjoy or agree with how the stretch goals are being run, but many of us enjoy the change of pace. ^"Cheetah Cub" When we make this stretch goal, each of us will get 20 to 30 extra cards. How is that not a tangible reward? Huzzah. That should keep some people satisfied. We can hope. Thanks @Zem! It was my pleasure to speak out what many of us think. Also, campaign stretch goals have been updated Unfortunately, looks as if Cody won't be coming back, because he said a few things that don't make sense that I'd like clarified or to clarify for him. Oh well, rage quitting works. ^"Cheetah Cub" Elan's comments are here: www.cubsubcorps.com/ElansComments.html And I agree with Sally, Aether, I really appreciated your comment from last night when I read it. It was exactly what I was trying to say but couldn't find words for, but with much better reasoning and thoughtfulness behind it. I wasn't having a good night, and I regretted showing it in the comments. Yeah, I'm actually liking Cody. As trolls, bashers, and normal haters go, he's not one of them thankfully! We have our fair share these campaigns. I was actually surprised by exactly how much thought he'd put into his list of ideals, whether or not I agreed with it. Why can't most people who find fault be like that? @Sally Thanks :) I agree with the quote you have. Cody abandoned the campaign after his comment, to keep answering him is a toss in the air (not sure if that's a valid expression in English, I literally translated that one) because every backer can see the comments if they want to but maybe those that abandon won't want to. Maybe what different things people think might be fun to do socially would help? I think there is merit in "10 pictures of bears shitting in the woods"..... but it isn't necessarily a good idea at the same time..... Well, there WILL be trolls. The important thing to realize is that that isn't everyone, and a discussion can be had to elaborate on view points and frustrations. What do more people want? Improved card stock is on the list. Stretch goal issues are on the list as well, but monetary stretch goals is really a complaint that doesn't really hold a lot of ground argued in a way outside of maybe the one Cody made (which is a free expression of opinion). @Aether: nicely said! (re your last night's long post - I'm still catching up) @Dr. P/@CB/@GC & others : Also well said, and good handling of the negativity (especially @CB "I'm glad that most of us here prefer to talk about what's right with this campaign.") I've got a quote attributed to Henry Ford stuck over my desk to remind me: "Don't find fault, find a remedy." FWIW, I haven't seen much of the complainers sticking around after they've come in and said their bit (and here not referring to those who've elaborated on their opinion and engaged in the discussion). I appreciate the community building here as much as the ridiculous prospect of the game. It's refreshing to see the extent to which the creators appear to be having fun with this venture. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Dr.P. we have all of Elan's comments on the www.kittencorps.com/cubsubcorps.com/KickStarterComments.html link, but I can pull his comments into a separate page. I'll have it up later this afternoon. Much better elaboration Zem! To elaborate, if we had monetary goals, if anything, they'd be pushing us to pass Exploding Kittens and we'd fail. At this scale, monetary goals become moot and arbitrary. They tried to make it fun instead, so I'm sorry you guys aren't having fun with this, but I can assure you many others are. Also, as I mentioned, none of the people you'd convince to not back this actually read these comments. Ever. It would make life SO much simpler if they'd actually read them or read further on the campaign page, but alas. Cody, as I mentioned, they don't care about money. They don't have monetary goals because they already knew they'd be earning this much money after Exploding Kittens. Therefore, they decided rather than just focusing on money (with only 2 options, most people will be giving $35 for the NSFW deck, and they knew there'd be tens of thousands even just by EK backers, so they knew the kind of money they'd be getting), they'd focus on the people. In short, it's NOT a surprise whatsoever to them that they're earning this kind of money. None of the people who know them are surprised whatsoever they're earning this money, and if anything, it's a surprise how low it is. They don't care about the scale of money, they care about the scale and happiness of the backers. We're trying to relay your concerns to them, but please, if anything, be patient. @Zem: I would suggest toning the sarcasm WAY down. I see a lot of complaints, and confusion, due to it. Do we have content on the cubsub site regard what comments Elan has made so we can ensure that is kept up to date for those that miss that kind of thing (as we tend to talk a lot....). It is a little bit of history repeating Zem. Well we would have to keep it relevant. We could say "sign this petition to make the creators know we REALLY want this" kind of a thing. However, I do not know the logistics of doing it outside of that. I don't understand this process. I don't like this game! I'm going to back it anyways so that I can preach in the comments that nobody but the loyals EVER read (as we found out ALOT during EK) about why nobody should back this. ^"Cheetah Cub" That would be difficult to do, since most people don't read the comments and some don't even read the updates. I support that idea @ Dr. P Is there any way we could get an ACCURATE poll (maybe a 'signed' one?) for those requesting that as either a goal/whatever? ^"Cheetah Cub" @Dr. P. also, if the game is printed on premium card stock, that would not prevent people who prefer sleeves from using them, so the only downside would be the increased cost of the stock. I don't anticipate that being a problem at the current price point though. That is a fair assessment CB. Sleeves do have their ups and downs. I do think that an extra box made for sleeves is probably a little impractical and could cause confusion with the orders though (for those that would like that, simply just my thoughts). ^"Cheetah Cub" @Dr.P. I agree that it would be nice if people would discuss here what type of stretch goals they would like to see. I'm actually in agreement with those people who want the game to be printed on better card stock. I have backed several KickStarter campaigns that used premium card stock and they are among my favorite card decks. Exploding Kittens compares poorly with those decks in terms of both beauty and durability. I would pay extra for an Exploding Kittens deck if it were printed on premium stock and the same goes for Bears vs Babies. Earlier, someone suggested that people who are concerned about durability should sleeve their cards. Personally, I do not like using sleeves. I find that the sleeved cards are much more difficult to shuffle. The look and feel of a sleeved card leaves much to be desired. The plastic tends to stick to itself and doesn't allow the cards to slide around as freely in my hands. My vote is for premium card stock. I like the sound of a duel - that often happens at games night! ...........does it call for.... a DUEL?! An even split, rock paper scissors...? Draw the straw?! I am sorry you had that experience. Not to excuse them (or even myself, I do get gabby....), but the fan backers do suffer from as much of that impassioned emotional thing I talked about earlier. So people are going to get snappy, especially when a difference of opinion is had. It's human (if it's not actually a troll....). @T.J.: My thoughts on it, is likely if the two players are not equal in strength, then the stronger one gets it. If they are equal, then probably a flip of the coin? But that's just my speculation, and definitely something that Elan and team could clarify for us. That is a fair question @Steff 'Ginger Cub' - This game looks better from a design standpoint (though I wonder about the value/pricing standpoint if we never unlock the stretch goals). If you don't eliminate players early, then this game will address one of my big concerns with EK. Though one of the core mechanics of this game hasn't been properly explained. I asked Elan Lee to clarify it and backers here jumped on me and told me to worry about mechanics and how we should blindly support this regardless of how the game plays. FWIW, the mechanic I'm curious about is arguably the core mechanic of the game. Once you prompt the babies to attack, you get points for killing the babies if your bear/monster is more powerful than the babies. However, the babies attack everyone at once. If multiple players are powerful enough to defeat the babies, who gets the babies/points? ^"Cheetah Cub" Wow, @T.J. Brumfield, your latest comment was also much better without the superlatives. I'm not surprised that EK scored pooly on BGG, since that community is geared more toward hard-core strategy gamers. EK, on the other hand, is geared more toward the casual gamer. However, anyone who suggests that Exploding Kittens involves no playing strategy does not have a clear understanding of the different card types and how to use them to gain maximum advantage over your opponents. I respect your opinion, but I prefer Exploding Kittens over many of the rules-heavy board games on BGG that require you to keep track of multiple resources in order to even play the game. It's a matter of personal preference. I do, however, frequently play board games with a group of people in Charlotte, NC. They could comment a little more CB, if just a wee bit. SGs do provide goals, so again a little complaint makes sense. It is fine to voice that one doesn't like them, or how they're done. On the other hand, what kind of stretch goals they WOULD like to see outside of monetary ones would be nice for a change. "I would like to see this kind of thing... (>.)>" I didn't see that comment TJ, nor do I always go back and read. If true Zem is out of line there. However, games are to each his own. I did like EK, but surprisingly I liked the mobile version better myself. I would give one a 6 out of 10 and the other an 8 out of 10 personally. Just how it is, but I do still see it as a quality game if one that isn't played all the time. . True, we shouldn't blindly support a product. If you want to know more or see a demo, let's have that voiced as a concern. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Cody of the Kodiak Clan, your last comment was presented in a much more reasonable fashion. I do not speak for every backer, but here's my response to your comments: 1. Having only social stretch goals does not make it “more fun” -- your opinion 2. Having only social stretch goals is not selfless, if anything it’s greedy. -- your opinion 3. ... fanboyish reactionary comments -- your opinion 4. The release of this seems downright poorly thought out. -- your opinion 5. This campaign is lacking in communication from the creator themselves. -- false 6. ... That’s pricey for a pure card game. -- true, if you compare it to a standard poker deck. 7. I’m out. -- your decision ` In conclusion, I disagree with most, but not all of your opinion. @T.J. - genuine question, if you don't like EK (which is fair enough, everybody is different (me and my friends personally love it and it will always be a favourite on games night)), then why back BvB? Genuinely curious, not trying to attack or insult. Micah, personally attacking people and calling them pitiful repeatedly isn't very cool. FWIW, there is a reason there are more negative reviews of EK on Board Game Geek than there are positive ones. Most reviews place it firmly in the middle which is why it has an overall score of 5.8 <url>’ll elaborate exactly why I feel this campaign is lazy, and not worth peoples time in my view. 1. Having only social stretch goals does not make it “more fun”. A game that has both regular and social stretch goals gives benefits both in terms of people who want to be involved, and those that help create a successful amount of funding. Most campaigns that do social stretch goals also don’t require that people do an insane amount of different things to earn a single stretch goal. The fact that this campaign is ½ way over and not a single stretch goal is hit, speaks poorly for the design of that stretch goal (some might even call it pitiful). 2. Having only social stretch goals is not selfless, if anything it’s greedy. This game already made more than $2 million. Most small companies, give out a ton of bonus content to backers for raising anywhere near that money. Instead, we’re told that it’s selfless to not base stretch goals due to not wanting to make us spend more money. That’s bogus. That might hold water if this game wasn’t already 10K% over it’s goal. If this game was going to barely fund, and they were doing social stretch goals to help out backers anyway, that’d be pretty awesome. In this case, it’s feels greedy. 3. I’m all for the power of positivity. If this campaign is for you, then all the power to you brother(/sister?). But this super weird garbage of flooding legitimate concerns with fanboyish reactionary comments, is just weird. Unless you’re one of the designers yourself, we’re probably not talking about you. We’re voicing our concerns, and problems as we see them. 4. The release of this seems downright poorly thought out. It took them 6 days to put out the stretch goals. That’s is not what a group that is prepared does. That is what a group that hasn’t thought this campaign through does. 5. This campaign is lacking in communication from the creator themselves. Heck, look at battle systems terrain. They’re a 2 man crew and they’re in the comment section all the freaking time, ginning up conversation. I mean, with the reverent posters it feels like we have the creator in the comment section, but that’s different from them actually being their all the time. 6. We’re paying $35 for a 4 player game that comes only with cards (or $25 if you don’t’ want the nsfw only). That’s pricey for a pure card game. It’s not outrageous, burn the village down expensive, but it’s expensive. Considering that I can always find a discount and pick up the game cheaper at retail, I see no reason to actually back it here. 7. I’m out. This campaign isn’t for me. It isn’t for me due to ridiculous stretch goals. It isnt’ for me because of people who’d rather insult criticism rather then acknowledge it. It isn’t for me because it seems like a money grab with no reward for the backer. It isn’t for me because the designer isn’t interacting all that much. It isn’t for me because I can buy the whole game much cheaper later. ^"Cheetah Cub" How could anyone complain about such a revolutionary KickStarter campaign. That would be unthinkable! ` (note to self: add "revolutionary" to the list of extremist words.) ^"Cheetah Cub" +1, @Dr.P. Because CB, it is easier to use a 5-10 cent word than it is to elaborate and actually make a valid point. A process of emotion taking hold about a variety of things one believes in that causes thought to often, but not always, skip logic entirely. (...or it's just standard trolling. Why troll the hard way after all.) ^"Cheetah Cub" Oh, and, "ludicrous." Add that to the list of extreme words we're seeing in some comments. ... Why do critics of this campaign tend to use words like, "pitiful" and, "inexcusable?" When someone uses words like this, it comes across to me as being extremist. At least no one has heretofore use the words, "unthinkable" or, "unimaginable." Those words are overused in general. Unfortunately, now that I've mentioned them, they too will probably turn up in these comments before long. I'm glad that most of us here prefer to talk about what's right with this campaign. You don't HAVE to back either. Profit margins will be what they are, and aren't a relevant argument. They are agreeing to make a product with us as it's funders. We agree to fund it, that's how this site works. We aren't purchasing anything. Stretch goals are merely incentives to get funders. They create a product, they earn money (also how it works). Stretch goals aren't required @Bryan, and at least this way it is a way for the backers to have fun, rather than for them to watch the pledge numbers go up. If you've backed a project, then stretch goals that involve more money have little to do with you because there isn't much you can do about them. At least this way we can have fun and get to know each other :) Profit margins have to be ludicrous with 50,000 backers As we aren't obligated to get them in the first place, it's awesome enough. I mean, 2 mill for a card game with just cards. No negativity, just facts For A game of this scope and size it is funny that there are so few SGs. I get what everyone is saying on how this is a "unique" campaign but still.... Only 3 SGs is pretty pitiful no matter how you "dress" it up. Just my 2 cents ^"Cheetah Cub" Stretch goal totals have been updated on www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html. Still waiting for <url>` Mostly sorry about this storm of text though! I hope you read it all, but I don't blame you if you don't. *don't make MUCH money. I'm assuming since they have the processes all worked out for this campaign and aren't so surprised by the sudden magnitude of backers, they're more prepared and will be able to actually run this as a company. But yes, for EK at least, they didn't increase the prices, and in the sudden flurry of needing to hire people and searching for a production company, they didn't make nearly any money at all, and I don't believe they make nearly as much as you'd think from even the decks sold on Amazon, though now it supports a small company. Cody, they don't make money off of the campaigns. Last time, if they hadn't sold it after the campaign, they would nearly have lost money. It's not like they're making all 2 million dollars off of this. In addition, there wasn't originally going to be bonus content. In fact, this campaign bearly got started even though it was the original inspiration. And I didn't umbrella-insult everyone who disagrees, I was explaining. I am a bit pissed off, though, and I'm sorry for being short. Considering the past week I had, I'm glad I kept myself from actually insulting and swearing, it was close. But like I said, if you don't like the campaign and think it's not worth it, just don't support it. And hell, the worst case scenario is that you're right, we all suffer, you lord it over us, and we all learn our lessons and go on our merry ways. I'll just say again, these I find these Social stretch goals lazy and boring. It basically reduces any bonus content, puts the work on the backers, and allows them to make a ton of cash without giving much back to the backers. In wasn't going to go in this much detail, but if Micah's gonna make post after post insulting anyone who disagrees, then fine, I'll point out this campaign is poorly done for what you get. Krzysiek, I don't have a cat, nor a baby, nor a costume either, but it's enough to be here and support the campaign. Just have fun and enjoy the progress! It's really flying by this time, but it's actually very exciting, and it'll be a tense one down to the last, explosive minutes when too many people wait to throw their money in. ` Also, the pumpkin birth one isn't a waste of food, at least not in the United States. We have a tradition on the time going up to Halloween to decorate pumpkins anyways, so they made a goal that fits into that, giving people an idea of what to do for both the campaign and their Halloween decorations. They would have been carved and decorated anyways, the team just gave an idea for a specific use. TJ, I feel truly sorry for you. My friends and I play Exploding Kittens, whether regular, NSFW, or expanded, about once every few weeks, and it never gets old. When I got it, I played it multiple times a day for a week or so, and it didn't ever get old or boring. I hope you can find happiness in something else if you really didn't like it. Might I suggest The Contender? It's virtually a political debate Cards Against Humanity. If you don't like that either, in addition to EK, may God have mercy on your poor, pitiable soul. Are people really giving up on this campaign because of STRETCH GOALS?! Jesus, go to someone who can't deal with the pressure of their own goals. EK handles them really well, and most people now follow their example. Imma just gonna leave an hour and bits of Scary Halloween Electro House & Dubstep Mix here <url>` But really, I don't care. I'm just too used to dealing with people like you online. You don't need to throw your money at them, though because you commented, you already have. Go preach to some sheeple on a product with an untested team with no experience. They know what they're doing, and they do keep us updated within hours if you look any further than the very top of the front page. Every self-righteous troll who knows how major million-dollar-scale funds should go, maybe you should read my previous comment. If you were around for Exploding Kittens, you know how well it worked then. Monetary goals don't work with these styles and formats. This one isn't growing so explosively fast as EK, but the goals were conformed to our progress the first week, and were well thought-out before the campaign even began. They know what they're doing, and really, be thankful there are stretch goals as that's a completely optional feature they don't have to do. ` Also, they're doing them based off social media games rather than growth because they knew, as they learned the hard way with EK, that size doesn't matter. They have such a loyal fanbase they knew they could have gotten away with any goal whatsoever. So they decided to make it about the backers and the game, not the money, and I for one respect that greatly! We just played all of my card games in one night! Boss Monster, EK (with the imploding expansion), and the Contender! Too bad my roommate doesn't have his Cards Against Humanity deck here right now. We had 4 people, which doesn't happen often. 3 of us roommates and a friend. I really didn't expect to go through my entire collection, though. The only thing we didn't play was NSFW EK. Everyone talks about the "fun" of the social stretch goals vs monetary stretch goals. Well, that's pure BS. Working on $2 million dollars and the creators can't make REGULAR social stretch goal updates... ANY other KS and people would pull their funding. Reading the comments, no one knows the real time status of the achievements. This is inexcusable. But KEEP throwing money at them. Whenever anyone comments on the crappy customer support, people jump on them and try to defend the creators. But again... why do the creators have to interact at all? All the lemmings just keep blindly throwing money at them. Enjoy your "fun" kickstarter... They will still make an unwarranted amount of money for doing nothing. But I'm not going to give them my money.. it won't make a difference, but a least I'm not blindly following the crowd. night @CB yes, it is quiet indeed... Everybody is catching up with their adulting on Mondays... ^"Cheetah Cub" Speaking if being quiet, there's not enough attivity here tonight. I'm going to call it a day. Good night, cubbies, wherever you all are. The first goal should only need 10 achievement. And he's just so quit and doesn't update us ^"Cheetah Cub" I've never experienced a boring game of EK, especially the cell phone app. I guess it's just my personality. I pity you, @TJ. I hope you find happiness somewhere. I instantly threw money at Exploding Kittens because I love The Oatmeal, but really the game was underwhelming (especially given the massive commercial success. I tried playing with a group again recently and people quit the game halfway through because it was so boring. I threw money at Imploding Kittens hoping it would make the game better even though we weren't told anything about mechanics ahead of time. It actually is a decent expansion, but not enough to really salvage the game. This game looks like it might be better than Exploding Kittens, but we still don't really have a full explanation of mechanics. This has raised nearly $1.9 million, we're two weeks in and we don't have a single stretch goal unlocked. Right now $35 gets you 100 cards and that's it. I do really love The Oatmeal, but this is starting to diminish that love. ^"Cheetah Cub" A pumpkin puzzle would be cool, but it would take me a minimum of two weeks to make one, and it wouldn't be BearsvsBabies themed. @CB maybe a wooden pumpkin like the puzzle boxes? :) ^"Cheetah Cub" I wish I was good at carving pumpkins. I've tried several times over the years, but I suck at it. What I could use is a pumpkin CNC machine. Love exploding kittens, but honestly these stretch goals seem really... meh... Glad some of you enjoy them. ^"Cheetah Cub" There's a couple of cute beard babies on Facebook, but one has no hashtag and the other one has a handwritten hashtag that is unfortunately Photoshopped outside the border of the photo, so neither one counts. Dang! I just saw your bear beer pic btw great @bruno! that kind of attitude is what this campaign is about!! ^"Cheetah Cub" Cool. Have a beer for me. @Mike: Well, I can try to get my peeps to retake them. Good thing I still have the foods I shared. I also have 4 more bear-themed beers to share. ^"Cheetah Cub" Sorry, @Bruno, I don't make the rules. I just report them. I guess they're trying to discourage Photoshopping. I hope you can retake the photos. @Mike Really? Handwritten? So now 2 of my pictures don't count because I had put it on my computer screen? @Krzysiek Piwowarski we still need sculptures which you can make with stuff you found in your home (not necessarily food) also, Cheetah Cub is right: Enjoy other people's entries! It's really fun to look at them! ^"Cheetah Cub" ... enjoy ... Really fat-fingered that one! ^"Cheetah Cub" @Krzysiek Piwowarski, that's OK. There are two more rounds coming up. Maybe you can find something that fits in on of them. Regardless, enyou watch ing other people's entries. @Micah @Mike much as I'd love to I won't be able to participate in any of the given stretch goals: Don't have a cat Don't have a baby Don't have bear costumes Not a fan of wasting food for the sake of fun (pumpkin birth) Only thing I could realistically do is the photo of gummibear sharing but my friends have been really flaky with regards to meeting up so by the time I do get one done, the goal will likely be reached anyway. So yeah...I backed this project because I enjoy playing exploding kittens and reading oatmeal strips but the stretch goal tasks are leaving me in the cold. ^"Cheetah Cub" We just got 25 fighter jet cats, officially! www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html I just wanted to say that I love the stretch goal idea! It's been fun to see all the creative ways people have come up with to fulfil them. Plus it's great advertising for the campaign. Win-win :]] I count myself fortunate, Elan showed me the hand drawn deck nearly a year ago. I wish I'd heard about it hitting KS sooner. ^"Cheetah Cub" There's a person on the FidgetCube posting long passages from the Bible. I don't understand people who would rather push people away from their religion by being confrontational than find appropriate ways of persuading others to become followers of what they believe. Nothing to be sorry about I am feeling sad about it :( Hopefully I can find ppl tonight at the parade for sharing gummy bears/baby ruths or Bear's in a group.......nowwww can it be "Bears" like the fuzzy guys or does it have to be teddy bear type costume? LOL ^"Cheetah Cub" Sorry. I was just trying to help. I was wondering about the printable hashtag since the instructions said handwritten ^"Cheetah Cub" Also, I just found out that the hashtag now has to be HANDWRITTEN, so the printable hashtag on the website will be taken down. This is going to be tough. Really need those group photos, if we're going to pull this off. Any CONS scheduled? nice to see that we are getting closer to the 2 million pledged goal :-) I think we might actually hit 3.5 million by the end of this campaign. ^"Cheetah Cub" Bad news, folks. The official totals are out and we've gone backwards on four of the goals, including two of them that we had thought we had already reached. We still need 1 fighter jet and 3 sculptures. Check www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html for the latest totals. Krzysiek, nah, it's more fun this way! And if you were around for Exploding Kittens, you know how well it worked then. This one isn't growing so explosively fast as EK, but the goals were conformed to our progress the first week, and were well thought-out before the campaign even began. They know what they're doing, and really, be thankful there are stretch goals as that's a completely optional feature they don't have to do. ` Also, they're doing them based off social media games rather than growth because they knew, as they learned the hard way with EK, that size doesn't matter. They have such a loyal fanbase they knew they could have gotten away with any goal whatsoever. So they decided to make it about the backers and the game, not the money, and I for one respect that greatly! ^"Cheetah Cub" @Krzysiek Piwowarski, Nope. You're the only one. The rest of us are enjoying the campaign and the spirit in which it is being conducted. You can join us, if you like. Anyone else think it's pretty ridiculous we're almost halfway through the KS, almost 19000% over budget yet not a single SG is unlocked because of the way they chose to run them? I'm all for having social media based SG's but as small bonuses, not actual expansion of the material =/ I'm assuming we have not gotten the Cats as jet fighters and the sculptures as they have been Unconfirmed for a couple days now? ^"Cheetah Cub" @PofT, good to see you! I hope you'll consider joining the crew. www.cubsubcorps.com Hi, Pot! How are you?! Hey PT! How's it going? Hey all! I've been gone for a while. Good to see everyone here. thanks Aether I'll keep that in mind as I post from my phone :D @Cha I liked the chain story on the playlist made with your comments and the songs' title I just saw them roo! Added to the count. I know I commented some of your past pictures with the #bearsvsbabies to see if they showed up in the hashtag search page but they didn't =/ so I think the #bearsvsbabies must be written directly on the post. For future pictures ;) Just added 3 pics to FB hopefully they count :D @Zem...it is Halloween...even if the adult parties are mostly over and it's more the ravaging hordes of kids this eve, a bit of Halloween day music does the wicked soul good :) And thanks to attentive backers like Kyle Miller (A BIG Thank You Again!!) we were able to nip that fake bear's butt quickly and thoroughly :) Huzzah for taking down scammers! It'd be funny if there were another Exploding Puppies or whatever it were called, haha. I bet those poor backers learned their lesson! Wow, Cha, you got the whole day's playlist out early today! Babies disguised as bears is really close too, or should be at least. We need more beard babies and food shares! Come one people, break out the baby food and the felt/non-toxic markers! I'm glad to see that scam project is already gone. :) @Cha thank you for the answer LOL I am going to try for at least 2 :D How important is having the extra NSFW deck going to be in terms of having more variety of parts to build your Bears? I know I bought the NSFW decks with my Exploding Kittens set and never actually used them and ended up selling them off later on. They really didn't add anything to that game (other than the option to add more players, which we just bought a second normal deck to do). Will it be the same case with this game? @Roo...I've see just hands sharing food so I'd just try it :) Are we able to take pics of just 2 dif hands sharing the food or does it have to be face pics? People at work are sucking at wanting to do pics LOl @Johnny bc it has to be 10ppl in the same pic I feel like we should easily be able to get 10 people to dress as bears or babies. Why is that one not yet achieved How far are we from reaching more of the achievements? Love to see these kickstarter campaigns that have such simple tiers. no extras, no fluff, just a good game. keep it simple. <3 Still play exploding kittens almost every boardgame night with my friends, look forward to adding another hilarious game to our arsenal! For a smashing Michael Jackson - Thriller <url>"Cheetah Cub" The project's creator has been deleted too. Good work all! Looks like the person who put up the fake one has cancelled it now :-) ^"Cheetah Cub" Also, Elan has reported the scam campaign to KickStarter, so it shouldn't be long before it gets removed. ^"Cheetah Cub" New Stretch Goal counts posted on www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html Zem the Wriggle Mattress :) That IS how I sleep, Cha!. @Zem..did you finally stop wriggling and get some sleep? :) @Geist...hope you're having a purrfect time at KittenCon! Good Morning Cubsubians! Good to have so many people reporting the scam! Hi, everyone. Morning, whether good or not. Happy Halloween @Geist Happy Halloween fellow Cubs Also reported the other project. I have reported the other site as well. Hi, maybe the question has already been asked but do we have a french version ? Oh it's already been posted, I'll go report it to KS then... @Elan, saw a similar looking project on KS Newest releases at <url>` Hey, you guys think it could be Sklorz Goltovka again?! Maybe he upped his game! ^"Cheetah Cub" All of these spammers, scammers, and flim-flammers are getting annoying. It seems you can't have a successful campaign anymore without attracting these scum. Wow, some great philosophical questions about all of existence today with my roommate.Stuff about systems of measurement of temperature. Where did mammals break off of the animal timescale? What about the continuity of fish, reptiles, and amphibians? (did amphibians come from reptiles, reptiles from amphibians, or both separate from eachother?) Why is the sun's corona hotter than its surface? Is the sun really just a conspiracy plot by NASA? What is egg? And, of course, the most important of all, Are we human? Or are we dancer? I also reported the scam project. I hope they go to jail. ^"Cheetah Cub" @JACKSON, we still don't need your steenken watches. Now cease this violation of KickStarter rules before you get reported! And why in the world would I want a watch @Jackson when I'm backing a game... It's like those pesky sunglasses adverts... The title seemed appropriate Rush of Fools - Can't get away <url>"Cheetah Cub" @!C, great minds think alike. :-) ^"Cheetah Cub" We can still report the creator for breaking Kickstarter rules (the first radio button) and clicking on the False Claims button on the next form. This is valid because he is claiming to represent Elan Lee and Matthew Inman, which we believe to be false. I also reported under Breaking Rules - False Claims and provided this website link. Thank you Kyle!!! ^"Cheetah Cub" Absolutely! The creator of that project is attempting to steal Elan's and Matthew's intellectual property, including all images and descriptions displayed on the campaign's main page. www.cubsubcorps.com is also using images from the campaign, but we have been given express permission to do so by Elan. The false campaign is doing so without permission, which is a clear violation of copyright. @cha! I reported him also. What a load of crap. Better watch indegogo too. @Elan will have to report thos project! Intellectual property violation A project is infringing on your copyright or trademark. Kickstarter takes claims of intellectual property infringement seriously. For more information and instructions on how to report infringement, please visit our Copyright Policy and our Trademark Policy. Only claims filed by the copyright or trademark holder can be processed. @Kyle yes it is, we all need to report them. How stupid to try to copy a current running KS project on KS! is that for real? should we all report it to kickstarter? FAKE??? project?? <url>"Cheetah Cub" @Aether, that link is on the main Facebook page for BvB. You really have to look for it though. I'm glad I could help. ^"Cheetah Cub" Cubs are going back to Cleveland for Game 6! #FlyTheW weekend is over. I'm back! @Cha I loved the laser beams! what are they made from? @CB thanks for the link of 'visitor posts' on Facebook, I've been monitoring facebook's #bearsvsbabies page which doesn't display all results. With visitor posts I will be able to count a better estimate starting right now. @House arrest I agree with cha, dogs count as friends! (just don't give them chocolate please! haha) @Zem lol @Roo Hi :) @ Cha thank you :) LOL let me get on that tomorrow during the day :) @Roo...share away whatever you can get your paws on :) For the BvB food sharing... does it matter if we do something others have done? such as Bear claw sharing or gummy bear sharing etc? never mind LOL :( :D I see we got it unlocked :D Hey guys :D do we still need pumpkin giving birth? ^"Cheetah Cub" I would eat baby food for the team, if it was one of the fruit flavors. No strained peas, though. ^"Cheetah Cub" If you could get someone to eat Baby Food, that would also count. ^"Cheetah Cub" Has anyone shared Baby carrots yet? ^"Cheetah Cub" Looks good! And there I go again! Food share! <url>"Cheetah Cub" Whatever you do, don't give your dog any chocolate bears! Absolutely, just be careful what bear and beer foods you share with your pooch :) @Cha @Allison Oooooh, with the "Man's best friend" formulation, you can't go wrong! It's worth a try, at least ^_^ @House Arrest... absolutely share food with your dog, men's best friend!! :) 18 days remaining. Time is running out! Share away, people! @Mike Oh, yeah, I didn't check that one, the campaign picture seemed up to date. I'm relieved, I really thought it would have been a hard one to get since in 2 days, Halloween will have passed. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Bruno, it's confirmed on <url>"sharing food items" is a tough one... I already contributed 5 on my own and plan to contribute at least another one. Come on guys, we can do it! Also, I can't seem to find any "pumpkins giving birth" with the hashtags in the picture. Have we really achieved it or should it be unconfirmed? ^"Cheetah Cub" ... bear-themed dog food. ^"Cheetah Cub" @House Arrest, how about near-themed dog food? Unless my dogs count as friends I'm not going to be much help for the passing bear themed food item category. I don't get many visitors on house arrest ^"Cheetah Cub" @!C, I haven't counted your Laser Donut Baby yet, but I'm hoping it will show up in the totals by tomorrow. It HAS to be accepted, LOL! I was just playing GTA V online with my brother, and after blowing stuff up for a couple hours and then crashing an airplane, I get suddenly and inexplicably banned from online permanently! No reason, just banned!!! ^"Cheetah Cub" If we count the unconfirmed totals, we have achieved 13 of the required 15 to meet this stretch goals. That leaves us only two more to reach 15! Most of the low-hanging fruit has been picked though, so those last 2 might take a considerable effort to achieve. Please take a look at www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html and try to help out with the remaining tasks. I'm hoping to see at least 19 more BvB themed pumpkins by tomorrow night. It IS Halloween, after all. And now I'm gonna eat it. It's fun first play with your food then eat it oh like a bear no cat well bear cat. I'm a bear cat :) For just in case I made a Laser Donut Baby :) <url>"Cheetah Cub" ;-) ^"Cheetah Cub" Looks like the bearsvsbabies web team have taken Sunday off ... slackers! ^"Cheetah Cub" @Aether, I see them. They're done with a baby and construction paper. <url>"Cheetah Cub" @Aether, do you have updated counts for the others? ^"Cheetah Cub" @Aether, I'll put 0 to go and change the status of that goal to "Unconfirmed." According to my count we have already 26 jet fighter cats. So maybe we achieved that one already ^"Cheetah Cub" I know what it's like wanting to take a nap and not being able to disconnect long enough to do it. Just today, I had the Carolina Panthers game to watch, followed by the NASCAR race on TiVo because it happened the same time as the football game, to be followed by World Series Game 5, hopefully live if I can finish the race prior to the first pitch. I guess I can catch up with sleep after i die. ^"Cheetah Cub" Anybody hear about any more goals being accomplished today? I'm itching to do some updating of the website. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, I just got done explaining why it's OK to call me @CB vecause @CC would be too confusing, and then you ask me why you can't call me @CB any more? It's still OK. Don't over-complicate things. Dr. P, nothing, I just can't nap. Now I gave up because I have to do something, but my earbuds apparently disappeared from the face of the earth. I mean literally, someone would have to have actually taken them for them to be this gone. Ok, I added one more bear baby and 3 beard babies, how to I know if they're accepted? What's on your mind then Zem? I've been trying to take a nap now for like 4 hours. I can't fall asleep at all, and I just feel even more tired for it. @erin I don't see why not, nothing in the achievements implies you can't Question- Can I make my baby multiple different bear or beard costumes? If he ever lets me get anything done? Is it a laser beam? I feel we need more laser beams..... [mental note] @>>>>C @C!C [/mental note] Yup, just how it goes. Hoping we're making good progress elsewhere. ^"Cheetah Cub" On second look, the main campaign page shows only 10. It should be 11 though. Looks like the Campaign page is a little behind on listing the accomplishments. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Bruno Marc-Aurèle, you may need to refresh your browser. <url>"politics" My brother's kickstarter campaign for a card game posted the same day as Bears vs. Babies. They can't seem to get the type of exposure as this game. Any tips? <url>"cub" just to see what pops up. ^And of course, if you do submit your photo entry to Twitter or FaceBook, include the #BearsVsBabies hashtag in the descrptive text and if it is via FaceBook, be sure your privacy setting for your post is set to "public", so the people in charge of keeping the count can find it. Getting very close to unlocking a few of the stretch-goal tasks. You can see how far we've come and what still needs to be done to unlock the goal on the front campaign page - just scroll down a little ways. If you submit a photo to the challenge on Twitter or Facebook, be sure to include visible within the image the #BearsVsBabies hashtag, visible written on something in the image, like a sheet of paper or an index card or get creative, so long as it is clearly visable and on an actual object in the scene and not text added to the image in an image editor. Several good entries have been disqualified because of theis. :( 2-4 players isn't enough!! STRETCH to more players - you know you want to :) Will Bears vs Babies be printed o the same Cardstock as Exploding kittens? Just posted a picture of the BvsB pumpkin I made my sister carve! CB, what about CB? I know you too well as CB to call you CC. We can't all just go legally changing our names every campaign! ;) Woo, Geist! Have too much fun for us, and pictures! Kitten Con is in full swing! Definitely a bit more NSFW ;) ^"Cheetah Cub" @!C, lol Ok, my Bumble Baby may not or may have the balls to take on Bears ;) <url>"Cheetah Cub" I have to keep posting my new tag so people will quit calling me by my real name. ^"Cheetah Cub" @Zem, yeah, I got bored. 79 comments on a saturday?! That might be a new record! ^"Cheetah Cub" Wow, a quick switch from metal to pop! Here's a German Eurovision winner aside from Nicole's Ein bisschen Frieden song way back Lena - Satellite <url>"Cheetah Cub" Also very appropriate for Halloween. Very cool...Lordi...yeah the Eurovision Contest brings about some interesting bands Scorpions - Rock You Like A Hurricane <url>"Cheetah Cub" Ever hear of Lordi? Hard Rock Hallelujah <url>"Cheetah Cub" Def Leppard was mine. Got to see them in concert in Davenport, Iowa. *laughs...uhm yes those too Manowar was my fav metal band Sheryl Crow - If It Makes You Happy <url>"Cheetah Cub" Ooh, Hair bands! Meredith Brooks - I'm a **** i'm a lover <url>"Cheetah Cub" My life changed forever after The Beatles appeared on Ed Sullian, singing, She Loves You, and I Want to Hold Your Hand. ^"Cheetah Cub" ... but not as old as this old cheetah ... Melissa Etheridge - Bring Me Some Water <url>"Cheetah Cub" Seems like I've heard What's Up for years and never knew the title and artist before. ^"Cheetah Cub" Nope, listening to the playlist. @>>>C...did you run away? :) And because it's Halloween The Cranberries - Zombie <url>"Cheetah Cub" The >>> stands for Cheetah, so the C stands for Cub. Rod Stewart - I don't want to talk about it <url>"Cheetah Cub" As long as it's not plain old @Mike. *laughs...and where's your cub? Hmm not @^"CC"? ^"Cheetah Cub" ... Because Cheetahs are so fast. :-) ^"Cheetah Cub" In that case, I should be @>>>C I did. It's beautiful. ^"Cheetah Cub" Did everyone see what I did with the hashtag? www.cubsubcorps.com/hashtag.html Now no one has an excuse for forgetting it. HeHe it should be @C!C ;) ^"Cheetah Cub" It's like a @CC party! ^"Cheetah Cub" Hiya, @CC (See what I did there?) This thread needs some tunes Sam Sparro - Black & Gold <url># Going well. Been playing a lot of Neverwinter. Their Halloween event is happening. Thanks, I'm pretty fond of it, too. :) ^"Cheetah Cub" ... CapsLock got stuck ... ^"Cheetah Cub" btw, I still love your "Rango" AVATAR. ^"Cheetah Cub" Oh yeah. You can never tell when @Chameleon is lurking in the shadows. He tends to pop up now and then when you least expect it. How's it going, @Chameleon? People tend to still call me CP since I was Chameleon Prime for so long. :) ^"Cheetah Cub" The same thing happens with @PC. We have a Panda Cub and a Pub Cub. ^Cheetah Cub" Hey, this is fun spamming the comments talking about me. I could get used to this. :-) ^"Cheetah Cub" For instance, there's Cub-Cake, Cha! Cub, and Chameleon Cub, all of whom would be CC. ^"Cheetah Cub (Cheetahbutt)" @Clayton Smith, Long explanation: it was Cheetahbutt for Exploding Kittens, so people from that campaign shortened it to CB. I could go by CC, but that moniker would also fit other people, so they still call me CB. So if it is @Cheetah Cub how does @cb fit in? ^"Cheetah Cub" Looks like a slow day for stretch goals. Please excuse Grizzly Cub, he doesn't type and drink well. I've known him about 24 years, and I can't decipher that comment of his. ^"Cheetah Cub" :-/ There's no other Mike, that's Neetah. ;) Zem you catch well that I'd a hard one CB @Cheetah Cub I can't catch up to you two. I missed EK ^"Cheetah Cub" Maybe I can get people to stop calling me @Mike. :-) ^"Cheetah Cub" @Clayton Smith, I have to. I'm about 200 comments behind Zem right now. Got to sneak some in whle I can. He he @CB seems to be working ^"Cheetah Cub" Trying out a method of displaying my CubSub identity. KickStarter can't keep me from doing that! ^"cheetahcub" Sorry, that.s www.cubsubcorps.com/hashtag.html People who need a physical hashtag, ypu can get one by printing www.cobsobcorps.com/hashtag.html Thanks @Cha! I saw that banana yesterday and was eager to use it in some way. @CB I think there's no one to blame... we are around 50k backers, so there should be enough submissions. I wasn't there for EK but I would have loved to be. @Tyler: Part of the reason it's taking so long is because there is no piece of paper with the #bearsvsbabies on it. Any that don't have that are instantly disqualified from being countrd. I'm partially to blame for the stretch goals taking a while to complete. I have personally only made two submissions. I'm glad we have so many talented and creative people here to take up the slack where I have let you down. I must remember things differently than others though. It seemed to me at the time that it took forever to achieve some of the EK goals, especially the 100 person cat ear photo. We got it done then though, and I'm confident we'll get it done now ... and have a lot of fun doing it! @Cha! Cub, LOL. I was so focused on the numbers I missed @Aether's typo. @Tom Karbowski, I try to keep an accurate count of stretch goals met on www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html Please bookmark the URL and check it often, rather than continually asking the same questions in these comments. Thanks. Have you decided whether you want to join the crew yet? How the stretch goals have taken this long to be completed is beyond me. With Exploding kittens all the goals were destroyed so quickly. Where as we are moving at a snails pace in this campaign. @Aether...and I LUVED your latest sharky squidy creation! I'm sure there's some fun beer or even Baby related alcoholic beverages that could be shared :) OOOOOH! LOL I didn't notice! Now, it ALL make sense!! Yes! everyone share bear food and 'beer' food! hahaha @Aether... YOU said to share beer food. I just endorsed it or tried to :) Are you saying that you are sharing beer? and that you always knew that beer is good food? I think it is hahaha @Cha jajajajaja I don't understand what are you trying to tell me XD Wow! check out this halloween costume: <url>` I am not messing up the covers. Sliding in so as not to wrinkle all the sheets making sure the quilt stays nice and clean Have you ever seen a bed so neat? I'm getting intooo bed! ... sleepsleepsleeptimetogotosleepnow itisnightandineedtosleepwhileitisdark iamreallytiredtimeforsleep nowi'mreallytiredsleepsleepsleep I'm getting into bed! Hahahaha, that's an amazing easter egg, and I just went over to see it for myself! That's great. Also, 1.8M pledged!! Since the last count 2 sculptures added (7 to go) 2 beard babies added (20 to go) 2 cats added (4 to go) @CB hahahahah that's amazing!! you should get a prize for finding that easter egg and sharing!! I'm in Kansas City too!! I found an Easter Egg! Check the news page for more. I hear discussion of Kansas City! @JACKSON, please don't spam the comments with Indiegogo campaigns. We don't need no steenken watches! This user's account has been deleted. And these guys from South America had the bestest EK song <url># @Zem..like in you're playing Skyrim day & night? Such a freakishly cool video Tool - Stinkfist <url># @zem we go for the casino and BBQ, IKEA is just a bonus Uh oh, I think I'm going to finally start Skyrim after all this time. I blame the newly released anniversary Remastered version. Never played it before, but if you don't hear from me for months, you know what happened. Well, i am in Des Moines, so for me it is either Minneapolis, Kansas City, or Chicago. Clayton, yeah, I'm not driving even 3-4 hours just to go to Ikea. Yeah. I was thrilled after I moved to Charlotte, when I discovered they have an IKEA. Love the meatballs. Three Days Grace - Animal I Have Become <url># Saw these guys in concert with Breaking Benjamin Breath <url># That's tough, long way to go. We have two here in Philly there is an Ikea in Kansas City I think they're thinking of putting an Ikea in Omaha maybe. Other than that, the closest I've ever even been to an Ikea is Denver. Haha @Cup-Cake... I think I found this song for you back then The Creep (feat. Nicki Minaj & John Waters) - The Creep <url># Love the store and good cheap food too @CB... most of all my furniture is Ikea :) Was so happy they had IKEA here when I moved from Germany. Ikea is my savior. Aww good memories and good music I've forgotten about A Perfect Circle - The Outsider (Apocalypse Mix) <url>"Learnings: I don't screw as well on my right as on my left side" What... did... I... miss? Is this what you guys are up to when I'm away?! ` Also, I had no idea your name was from a song. That's cool. And found my namesake song :) Local H - "Cha!" Said the Kitty <url># Roger that, @Bruno. Maybe I can give a box of Teddy Grahams to a homeless person. We have them all over here. @Mike Bummer. Oh well, if you can find yourself some cool "Bears vs Babies" related food, share it, photograph it, post it! Halloween parties have started... @CB... whatever works for you!! ;) And building IKEA furniture is actually quite fun. :) @Bruno Marc-Aurèle, yep. Right time zone, wrong lattitude. I'm in Charlotte, NC. And because I was looking for this song Eivør - Undo Your Mind <url>èle, I'd love one of those beers, but I can't tell what city you're in. Learnings: I don't screw as well on my right as on my left side but in the plus side I found the hole for the mysteriously left over long screw --> Trofast mission accomplished :) @Bruno...awesome...the beer one is a good one. I've not seen that yet!! I'm really going for the "sharing food with friends" one. I already have 4 contributions already and I have a couple more in store. I can think of many super easy shareable bear themed foods: gummy bears, Teddy Grahams, Bear Paws, we have Kraft Peanut Butter in Canada... I even have 3 types of beers I can think of, but they are mostly local craft beers. That's 6 pictures I can take in the next few days. But I can't do it alone: join me! Everybody must be watching the World Series. No zem... it's all about $$$$$$$$$ ALso - Just posted my friend's Bearded baby! He's probably just like me and can't understand why people hate the cold. Just stare at him funny until he feels awkward wearing shorts in 0 degrees because you look like you feel cold for him. That worked on me. Awkwardness is a good social driver. ` Dr. P, they live only 20 minutes away, so it's no big deal of a drive. I'm just going to wake up at 9 or 9:30 and be out there in plenty of time. he drives me INSANE. Ugh, the worst.... he already sounds like a weird guy. @Cub-Cake - haha good point! Testing out my baking skills on my friends ready for my parents who are visiting next weekend :) Fingers crossed it goes down well! @Ginger cub- I'm the LAST person who would think it was crazy to be baking at any time of the day. @Potatten- Ugh... My landlord... driving me CRAZY. We yell at each other all the time! Half the time he asks about the heat being ok... but then when I say it doesnt come on, he gets all upset. I can't deal with him! @Cha! I love the stories about your kitties!! hahahaha ok! now's a good time because it looks like halloween parties had begun for me so the periscope will be available. I'll catch up later and will post some music video :) See you later! I'll leave you my most recent sculpture (which was piloted by a robo-squirrel) <url>"their" instead of "they're" in my previous. Unfortunately, I saw it the nan-moment I hit "post comment", and the horror, as well as the grammatical shame, is mine. I blame lack of food though. Off to lunch! :P Sorry, it just feels weird having been here so long but not having anything to contribute, so it's been forever since I commented. @Aether... thank you so thought I saw 4 posted from the same person, same fighter but different cats! @Yohannon...oh there's more. Here I thought the one I posted fit so well cays of the hurray one of the team reference. It's 'your' interjections in 'your' head, not gonna mess with that ;) @CB lol, a baby bed seems like a bad idea even if the baby is using a diaper. @Cha I think so #count update (last half hour) 1 more cat fighter/1 more bvb themed pumpkin @Mike Kabala: I do technical support for developers for a living. The REALLY smart ones just send me what they ask for... the "merely" very bright one's like to spend four times the time arguing with me why I don't need that output. So I really try to be good. :D @Anja: In all kindness: <url># @Zem wold have to be the Bear. Have you ever tried to sleep in a Baby Bed? Hahahahahahah there should be a joke war between Zem and Yohannon!! Only that you two must agree on which one is going to be the baby so it can be a Joke battle of Bear vs Baby I love it when you give me every thing I ask for! Yohannon's bio and Crew assignment have been posted on www.cubsubcorps.com Haha, love it @Yohannon! like the funny stretchgoals! haha, check mate! That's a good one. You can work with GM, the Purser! Also, yup, that was a good bio. Crew Assignment: Check Mate Duties: Arrr, I'll be cashing your checks, matey! And if yer lucky, you'll be getting more than half back! Bio: Yohannon is a chronic crowd sourcer who SWEARS he can quit any time. When he's not creating twisted art pieces to satisfy his crazy god's every whim, or commiting high seas pay check usury, he lives at home more or less quietly with his wife and two (only occasionally) explosive kitties. Like that? :D @Yohannon, yep. All I need is your crew assignment. Actually I don't even need that if you'd like to sign on as a Mate and change your crew assignment later. If you create a new crew assignment, please write a one or two sentence description of your duties. Also, I'd love to get a bio from you that's one to three paragraphs long (roughly). *coin drops* HEY! Does this mean that I get to be on the crew listing? (Great, and now the Schoolhouse Rock "Interjections!" song is slowly working it's way into my ears) @Mike Kabala; Thank you for the quick updates! It was a little freaky how fast the number changed from 5 to 4, so don't let anyone give you any guff. (I just spent an hour chasing magnets across a desk, I have to catch up a bit myself! :P) @Aether Tower: ((blush)) thank you! That was HARD. "Hey, I've got those bucky magnets that my wife scored me about 6 years ago that you can't get any more... oooo... I have a really sick idea. And this should be EASY!" [1 hour later] GwaHEEheheBibble STAY UPRIGHT, damn you! (The "props" were a desperate attempt to save what small vestiges of my sanity still remained. It helped that the slinky's are REAL slinky's, and thus magnetic. Until the baby's butt sucked itself into the smaller one, and damn those are some strong magnets.) @Zem, how come @Cub-cake can say it and get away with it then? It's a necessary evil no matter what I call it though. @Aether, Got it. Haha, that just sounded really snooty by accident. "Sorry, I couldn't be here. I had *actual* work. You know, a life!" ;) Sorry I've been gone all morning. I had to catch up with some actual work. @CB 2 more posts added to twitter during the last 15 minutes, another sculpture (very original with magnets) and food sharing (teddy graham's I love 'em) -4 sculptures to go (we are very close!!) -20 food shares to go I posted an update to www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html just now. I hope it's up to date. Dr. P, I had literally just come from 100 degrees to this, spending the previous week in other hot cities. I was pretty well along. And drank more water than most people can carry and stayed in the shade most of the entire time. Why can't you accept that the heat index beat the previous record like the news said while I was there. I mean, the real heat was 1 degree under, but the index was worse by 2 or 3. You weren't acclimated to the enviroment, of course it sucked. Dude, during the summer, I work hard in fields all day for a month or so in that kind of weather and it's not nearly as bad as those 3 days were. I really felt like I almost died at one point, I could barely move. I'll take any cold you guys got. I can go in a t-shirt and shorts until 0 F, so I doubt anyone here has anything too cold. Probably just right for me! I would just like to move to Florida or Arizona (in the USA for those abroad and not sure where i am talking about) I would like some of your heat, it's been a very cold week here. The highest temp was only 98 that one day in August. Exactly what I said, not that bad at all. Yeah, it totally wasn't at or over 100 with nearly 120 degree heat index. Which I can deal with, but it's worse in a city where you're surrounded by concrete reflecting it at you! Oh the summer here wasn't THAT bad. Also, it is colder than that when I start walking toward work. Count update: 8 bear babies to go 6 cat-fighter jets to go 21 beard babies to go I'll trade you, Dr. P. Wait, when I was in Philly this summer, it was near record-breaking heat, and had to walk around in it for 3 full days out in the sun while dreaming of home with its [less than]80 degree weather, and now we have over 80 and you're in the 50s?! ` And see, once again, it counts the less than symbol as HTML and doesn't let me comment with it! What the heck?! It's been icky and cold here in Philly.... It's just the day, I don't get it. It's Friday too! And hot! High of 85 here today! Though immediately after today, it'll cool down permanently, mostly between 60 and 75. So can't wait for cold! Yeah, you're absolutely right. Today is a very lethargic day. Man, kinda stinks I'll be more and more busy as the weekend goes on, 1 because I'll be busy, and 2, because I won't be able to be on here. Oh well. Lunch seemed to come later than ever today, but finally I can eat! I should never have rolled out of bed. Maybe some Paper Mario and the new Skyrim will help solve that! That's awesome HA! The oatmeal like my tweet with my sculpture, I feel so accomplished @Tom: Check the campaign page. We're close to pumpkin birth, but that one seems surprisingly hard. How many have we completed. Please either tag or message me so o can easily find the answer. I'll be away for a hour or so ^Oops, as mention in the photo caption, yeap. There was a higher-resolution version of that image, somewhere, that a few of us posted to be sure iy got counted. It had a sign in it, but we needed the high-res image to be able to decipher it. Red Wheel-Barrow, Rain, but the Chickens are unaccounted for, kind of a day around here, too. (sorry, William Carlos Williams) *Public Service Announcement* Please remember, for your photo entry to count towards any stretch goals, you MUST take the photo yourself and include a note in the photo (not photoshopped in) that says #BEARSvsBABIES. If you submit something that doesn't include the note, it won't count. /me humming along... "i'm just a cub in a sub floating along..." It's a lethargic kind of day LZ because of this pesky thing i have going on today called Work. they seem to think i should be productive for them instead of having funfor myself...while they pay me that is. Why is it so hard to find the motivation to comment right now? thanks a lot Dr. P!! Wow, it surely was really hard to count the 100 of them. I can't wait to see this campaign's picture of 50 people dressed as bears/babies <url>"hour" really. well, on the good side, you don't lose any more sleep hours for using the phone until late night. And yes, I'll cover your spam a while longer during my watch, although there's no way I can spam as good as the chief of spam. Done! Okay, the rest of the spam is up to you. I might even get a good 6 hours of sleep tonight! Well, rest easy, once this is downloaded, I'm off for good. This is my phone: <url>` Keith Fleming about 6 hours ago Exploding Kittens was a total garbage, boring Uno knock-off. Why would this game be any better? Hahahaha, and yet you backed this anyways? Good choice. Also, yeah, the only things EK and Uno have in common are that they're both card games. No Zem! you must! Fast-read them! AAAH GOD, 123 NEW COMMENTS?! I was only gone for 6 hours! 5:40 for Paper Mario and 20 minutes for homework just now. I meant to finish with Paper Mario at 11:00, and considering I pried myself away just before midnight, I'd say I did well by this week's standards! 5:40 playing since I started a new file and already 7 levels up and 3 entire chapters, not even counting the extensive cut-scene-full prologue nor the dozens of side quests I did! Worth every second! ` But no way am I catching all the way up in the comments! Probably some amount of cross-over crowd between the two. I know some of the regulars here were pretty present in the FC comments section. (I odered a couple Fidget Cubes myself. ) And 1.7M!! with no one to hear. @Mike I didn't pre-ordered but some friends did. I think I will end playing with theirs. Who else pre-order a Fidget Cube? I did I should have it by December. I can't wait!! Hi Cha, how you doing? I will proceed to listen tonight's playlist while staying on watch. (I must count every post again and luckily we will witness the 1.7 million in the next minutes) I wonder if we can get the game sooner since they have raised over a million dollars Humph... <url># Sleeps... Me and Lana are saying good night see you on the... Lana Del Rey 'Flipside' @Clayton... all inspired by your backed KS VAMOAIGNS Enjoycyx What is a Bears vs Babies war without.. The Gummy Bear Song <url># Yay for sculptured baby nipples :) Every print job needs lots of black paint The Rolling Stones 'Paint it, Black' <url># Just finished my sculpture! Never sculpted baby nipples before We all need a bit wizardry in our lives BAP 'Do kanns zaubere' <url># Because man can Herbert Grönemeyer 'Männer' <url>#bearsvsbabies in your pictures! @Karl In each tier description it states that "-If you'd like more than 1 deck, just add $25 for each extra deck you'd like. (we'll figure out any extra shipping charges when we send you the survey after the campaign.)" same goes for the $35 tier...I hope this helps If you want more than one copy can you just double or triple your pledge amount? Or are you going to open a pledge level for this? Thanks! Pictures of you sharing BvsB related food items. I'm bound on getting that one, already posted 3 of them, will post more! Damn you, take my money! its ok Dr P. I heard most genius's talk to themsleves I see I'm talking to myself again [ZEM!!! Where for art thou?!] Or maybe we hit it when I wasn't paying attention.... Anyway we of the cubsub group keep our own small count here you can check out. It's pseudo-relevant, as they do have the final say after all. We try to keep it accurate: <url>"hola drinkets!" Hips drinkers! I just spent an embarrassing amount of time watching vines Just popping in to say I'm still around, just really busy. <url>"Bears of the Sea". They're the only known critter to survive the coldness of space a be revived. They're water-born critters, little roly-poly things. @elizabeth- totally worth it! Wow, apparently people just like to throw money at you. I'm not saying you're not worth it, but you asked for $10k and you're over $1.6 million now. :) OK, I'll bite ... What are tardigrades? Will there be tardigrades? Pleeeeeeze? Bah! Anyone who thinks EK was an Uno knockoff needs to have their head examined! The two are nothing alike! Technically, it's the oath of The Bear Watch, so you don't have to take the oath to be a crew member. Oh wow! Thanks CB!! Also, I agree with you Pub Cub. Many times it is more about the good company with your friends than the game mechanics themselves. I second that @CB xx Everyone, look at @Aether Tower's updated bio. It's the coolest one so far. I think we should consider adopting her oath for the entire CubSub Corps: <url>"Game of Bears," or, "Bear of Thrones." Deep-water gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no sea-floor lands, father no ugly-monstruous-babies. I shall wear no crowns but party hats and win no glory but BvB games. I shall live and die at my post. I am the periscope in the darkness. I am the watcher in the sub. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers like Zem, the shield that guards the realms of cubs. I pledge my life and honor to the Bear Watch, for this night and all the nights to come. Wow! new backers!! That's awesome!! Also, I lost count of the new pics, I will return in the night to keep up. Btw, yesterday night after Geist went to sleep I made a vow «COMPLETELY ORIGINAL» for my duties on the sub, it went like this: And the email is only been out for less than 2 hours! Best funding day since Day 4. The thing is, is Elan is a player, as well. I'm sure thius was created out of brain-storming with friends, during late nights, with plentiful caffeine. :) ^Has been known to play a mean game of UNO, if we're to put all cards on the table. ;) EK was more of a Russian Roulette variant. The type of humor might not appeal to everyone, true, but most people who collect this are familiar with the creators, or are adventurous players,who do so with a variety of games. @Keith Fleming, Hahahahahahahahahahahaaaaah! Good one! @Keith - I grew up playing UNO and we own and play EK. The two games are not similar and EK is super fun to play (we use it all the time). Sorry to read that you don't agree! @Keith Did you just back this game to complain ? between KS Fees, packing, shipping, and material cost they will probably end up writing checks for at least 30 to 40% of the amount they receive from this campaign. They will then have to pay state and federal taxes on the profits which can be as high as 40% That said they will still end up with a healthy amount of profit after this is all done. Exploding Kittens was a total garbage, boring Uno knock-off. Why would this game be any better? Printing companies, packaging companies, storage units, shippers, offices, employees, lawyers... it's not just profit 60K , so far this hour 8_O Would love to take part in the Stretch Goals fun, but can't :( Had fun backing Exploding Kittens, hopefully the tomfoolery counts even if there is probably too much cash again. It like Elan Lee and Oatmeal are literally printing money for fun stuff. Can't wait to see if my weirdness was counted or not lol. I won't be mad if it wasn't lol Card expansion is really nice and in play, probably rather desireable, as building beasties probably gobbles them up pretty quickly. I can see the want for multiple or at least expansion decks, later on. ;) Why does rewriting history always have to involve ****? FYI: Yesterdays backing total was about 24K. In the last 30 minutes the backing amount added was twice that. I see what they did there. :D wat=what wonder wat will be the end-score $1.6 million and counting ... Okay let's see... I have <url>#BearsVsBabies stretch photo posted with a handwritten note visible in the pic when I get home tonight. New backers, there's your survival kit; GO! @Pub Cub, +1. Remember, it has to be a physical object. You can't just Photoshop the tag in. Thanks @LZ-- I attempted to add that but my phone is working up. Reminder for anyone participating in the contests, to include yhe #BearsVsBabies #hashtag, written out on an object in the photos> Make it legible. :) oo Thanks @mike, nice to see the stretch laid out WOO! Thank you Melissa/Mike! Saves me the trouble of figuring it out myself. (Yeah, I'm a numbers geek too. I like to see what the current state of ANYTHING is. And yes, this presidential (US) election is making me slowing lose my mind. TOO. MUCH. DATA... not! Looks like I picked the wrong time to try watching something on TiVo. Welcome, backers. Glad to have you aboard. thanks @melissa ! I think I knew that ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ but I saw a comment saying we could 'now see' and thought maybe there was a dedicated space awwww... you already had me after "babies"... i hate them! www.cubsubcorps.com You need the www Hey guys! Go to cubsubcorps.com to find updated numbers onthe stretch goals! Every... single... time... I look at the campaign video still-screen, I think of the Bear from the EK mobile game saying "I'm a party bear!" XD @Peter No kidding. I think the initial funding was just the sheer force of gravity this group has developed because of the first go round; Now that they're actually TELLING people about it, I shudder to think. I mean, thinking just makes me shudder, so I'll try to avoid it. (Huh, kinda missed this part. :P) Looks like your in for a LARGER RIDE than with Exploding Kittens. Good Luck! WOOT! Woo, I'm back. Anyone miss me? :P After that last crazy MST3K kickstarter, I declared myself DONE for the year. Seriously. I even managed to miss the start of this one (I think I joined Combusting Felines within the first two days), but then, darn them all, they SPAMMED me. I was helpless in the face of their porking e-mail. Okay, so it technically wasn't spam as I wanted to receive it, but it was a low blow naetheless. So yeah, I went for one... then two... then I realized I wanted one to give my daughter when she's old enough (I have the NSFW popping **** deck held for that gift giving frenzy when the "in" drops from "age inappropriate"), so right off the bat you HAVE me already. Thanks to Mike Kabala for answering the question I was already asking myself after I discovered, to my delight, that Elan and Matt realized that it wasn't about the money, it's about the BUZZ... er, I mean the CROWD; Namely, what hadn't been done yet? :D Mike Kabala - Re: reading instructions before posting pics. Remember, here in America, hours of work can save you minutes of planning. XD @Christina - search for hashtags on twitter- #bearsvsbabies you can also do the same on Facebook. Also go to the bears vs babies facebook page and look up user posts Would love to see 50k backers! How do you see people's submissions? Ah, just checked - got it! ;) EK sent out an email blast about this game and its about time that they did it. @pub- EK update went out! Check your email! Whoa - sudden surge! Was just checking in and within a couple minutes the numbers started jumping?!? What did I miss?!? I haven't really been paying much attention to the time travel shows. My current addiction right now is West World on HBO Hehehe.... Leonidas and I are cuddling and listening to the rain outside. Perfect time to watch numbers scroll. @CB- thanks so much for all your work on this campaign. I've just been so busy these few months. I wish I had more time To stay focused and involved! Trying as much as I can! Hmm, by my last count, there are no less than three series on Television right now filled with people messing around with time travel to "save history." Did anyone compare notes? Woho! Yup, just got the email. Hold on to your butts! This is fun! I'm usually never around when an announcement goes out! EK update went out just now I have a friend who is supposed to be giving her baby a beard and adding the note and submitting it... Hey, there IS a surge! Wonder what caused it? I wish people would stop callin g me "Mike." Yeah, except I don't watch streaming shows unless I HAVE to. Blu-Ray is my preferred format. Welp! We should see a small surge in backers! @Mike same for me in regards to my age at the time it came out. The nice thing is that now I can go back and watch a lot of stuff that I missed on Netflix or Amazon. I have also discovered several really good shows from South Korea, Japan, Canada, UK and Australia that I never would have seen prior to the internet. One of my favorite South Korean drama shows is called Coffee Prince. I generally watch it at least once a year. My favorite Nickelodeon cartoon was Ren and Stimpy when John K was still around. It wasn't the same after they fired him. Obviously, there is an aspect of Spongebob Squarepants that I had previously overlooked. Of course, I missed the first couple of seasons because it was on Nicolodeon and looked ridiculous. My age at the time it came out may also have been a factor. I did like the plankton, though. maybe i should give sponge bob a try if its on netflix @Roo I never really got into sponge bob when it first came out because i thought it was another stupid cartoon that was made for 5 to 10 year olds with no serious plot or story. That said I do miss the good old days when they made great cartoons like Animaniacs, and Pinky and the Brain "Nematodes are people too" Hahaha... oh those nematodes! @Zem, there is a way around that: Read the directions before spending those hours setting up a submission of amazing quality. @Zem my fav is the one where he goes to live with jellyfish and gives his friends their equivalent of crabs LOL and the one where they learn to curse :D It makes me so sad to see all the ones that took hours to set up and are amazing quality, but they didn't have that one little qualification. I really wish there were some way around that. I'm watching all of (the good) spongebob again, and that beats out even Shrek in adult humor in a children's cartoon. Dang, spongebob is SO dirty sometimes! I really hate it when people obviously go to a lot of trouble to create a really great photo and then disqualify themselves by not including the hashtag note in the picture. The hashtag note should be the easiest part, yet so many people miss it. No note though.... There is a REALLY good pumpkin baby on Instagram too!! <url>` Night, yeah I'm jealous! Though I mean, my picture is one of my favorite pictures, but yours is really cool! CB if we're going for what is technically 'a bear', then we open ourselves up to a whole 'nother NSF ball game. I have a Bear! I have a Baby! Unh! Baby Bear! I have a Bear! I have Two Babies! Unh! Two-Baby Bear! Baby Bear! Two-Baby Bear! Unh! Bear Two-Baby Baby Bear!! @Aether that is a great idea!!! I am also going to check during the Halloween Parade on Monday if we still need it :) Check out my sweet new digs (profile pic) I got from an artist whose game I backed! Are you guys jealous? Yeeeaaaaah, you're jealous. XD CB, i have no idea, Kickstarter is just stupid sometimes like that. I've used < plenty of times before. "use &amp;lt; to get a &lt; symbol." If there are any Chicago NFL fans out there, try taking a picture of yourself wearing a Bears jersey. (Technically, dressed as a "Bear.") Hi! Just checking in. I've been out (still I do) searching in a big costumes-market-corridor in my country for bear masks or baby ornaments. I haven't had any luck. There are tons of werewolves and I don't wanna cheat. I pass the tip in case any of you could use the idea. Go to a crowded costume market and agree to 'try' the masks on. Convince the customers to help you and take a pic. Don't forget a Big note with the hashtag. That could work. I'm still searching in another place, though Don't know why you had a problem, @Zem. It works for me when I just type in the characters I want without any HTML formatting. <30 yay and thank you :D Well, it is when KS doesn't mess with it. Let me try again: < @Zem, try &amp;lt; to get a &lt; symbol. It's HTML Magic! Roo'a bio is up. <url>"All ginger bears are my minions, and they help me steal the delicious food that the other cubs bring aboard the sub." NOT THE PILLOW CHOCOLATES!!! NOOOOOOOO!!! Someone call up HC to defend her chocolates! There were some really good photos of pumpkins giving birth to pumpkins. Sadly, they did not have the hashtag in them. OK, here's what we still need: 1 photo of 10 people dressed as bears or babies 1 photo of 50 people dressed as bears or babies 12 more photos of babies disguised as bears 8 more sculptures based on characters from the game 23 more photos of an actual Beard Baby 3 more photos of pomeranians wearing incredible underpants 11 more photos of cats dressed as fighter jets 24 more photos of babies dressed as tanks 23 more photos of Bears vs Babies themed pumpkins 2 more photos of a pumpkin giving birth to another pumpkin 23 more photos of you sharing Bears vs Babies themed food items with friends "We're on the good ship, lollypop...errr Crawfish McThundersquish..." <url>‴Σ(∛5σ·62²θ)‴ ¼θ²√-1i —————— ± ———— ‴½σ³÷41,065‴ ∑σ(1::3) According to my calculations we have 13 babies as bears, 17 sculptures, 13 cats And we should get word of the sculptures later today from Cap'n Lee Currently, we have the following: 12 babies as bears 16 sculptures 13 cats @Aether, please don't make me do math. What are the Total counts for disguises, sculptures, and cats? @CB regarding the count, during yesterday's periscope watch these numbers changed: 1 more baby disguised as a bear 1 more sculpture 1 more cat Thanks @CB :) @Aether, glad to see folks discovering the other pages on the website. There's also a Press page that tracks news stories about Bears vs Babies. @Ginger Cub, thank you. <url>"Roo." You can talk about your duties aboard the Crawfish McThundersquish/. Just have fun and let your imagination take you wherever it wants to go. @C.F. "The Ex-President" Heyns, either way is fine. I'm looking forward to getting your bio and posting it on www.cubsubcorps.com soon. I have no clue what to write lol @Roo, youo need to write the bio and then I can post it. Just put it in the comments. See you around then Ex! Have a good one! Well if you do it more often you'll be sore less and less.... though the weather for it is going away swiftly T.T I have to run away soon, have to go pick up the kids and then make dinner. I'll try to re-appear later tonight. TEP! Hiya!! That's OK Zem. I will find some sleep somewhere. I'll probably take a nap today, though, in which case I'll look into the shipping cost for sleep. My roommate convinced me to bike home from work last night. I am SO. SORE. Creeper! HI! Sorry, TEP. I need way more sleep than I got. @CB, I should be able to cobble together a decent BIO tonight. Do you want it mailed or posted here? I should still have your e-mail floating around in the mess that I call an inbox. Cubs! Sorry!!! Morning Cub-Cake! Morning kittens! Wet feet monster? Ooh, could we make a whole line of those curses you wouldn't wish on someone? Like stepping on a drop of water while in socks, or stepping on a lego, or these amazing ideas: <url>� Good morning all! I will be attempting the bvb themed pumpkins. Hopefully my tweaking of it is accepted. I'll post fb links in a few hours. For now I'm on my way for coffee then work � Any new crew members, assignments, bios? You've got to keep me busy folks. www.cubsubcorp.com @Aether has been up all night but I think more working on his important stuff. So not sure where we are with accounting for things to meet goals Guten Morgen @CB ..it's a dreary day here so I'm trying to change my attitude if I can't change my environment :) Of Monsters And Men 'Wolves Without Teeth' <url># Good morning cubs. Looks like I missed some lively discussion overnight. Have we met any more goals since midnight ET? Not that I'm saying I'm a monster or a monster with wet feet..most of the time ;) Yes wet feet suck. Hmmm wet feet monster :) ugh that sucks Oh I remembered my umbrella but I'll have wet feet later for sure :( I beat out any wetness.... but I really don't want to be wet in THIS weather so I most definitely have my umbrella. @Aether Tower, Haberdasher is in the dictionary because it ends with "er" and fits in with all of the aliases for "Superbacker." It was funnier in the comments, because it came later. In the dictionary, arranged in alphabetical order, it appears much sooner. Well I made it to work without getting too wet. It wasn't a good idea to wear my Jack Parcels takkies today... Not really. @Dr.P... does it matter what day? That monster at the end is the best! And next campaign I want an airship please! Ugh, why is Halloween on a Monday! A really cute video of Monsters and Men 'Little Talks' <url># Good Morning Dr. P and Ginger Cub :) Morning Cha!, morning Dr. P, morning anyone else who's out there :) Mornin' y'all! @Aether... it was a long or short night depending on perspective I see. *smiles impishly* Finally. Everyone is asleep. *leaves pron traps in case Prof. F comes by* Hahahaha don't worry Ex-President. It was funny. Have a good day sir. Thanks Jenn! Looking forward for your cool creations. Today is the day when we meet those 15 goals! (Maybe not, but with positive attitude we will get closer) Can't figure out why I thought you were in Australia. Cha thought I was in the U.K. @Aether very cool :) But, it appears I need MORE coffee, as I entirely mis-read your post Aether Tower. :( It's currently 09:35AM over here. So not still awake, rather just got in to work 2 hours ago. Wow, you still awake Geist! Morning Ex-President. Just wanted to share the cat who is also a taco <url>` Geist, why are you still up? I would have thought you'd get extra sleep before tomorrow, or at least that a couple dozen Mike's Hards would have made you sleepy. Thanks Cha! @Tower: I have a little German and Spanish in my screen name. I am a horror fan so I mixed a little "Day of the Dead" into my name. It's supposed to read "Ghost of the Dead Kitten". Is it perfect? No but neither am I. Night Cha! Thanks for tonight's playlist. I'm already on n my rack so now sleeps. Good Night all, safe flight Geist Björk - Big Time Sensuality - Rare Night Version <url>ök 'Waterfall' <url>óða tungl <url>Ólafur Arnalds - Near Light <url># Anyone wanna help me pack? Of Monsters and Men 'Dirty Paws' <url>Ásgeir - Heart-Shaped Box <url># Cause it's cold, some Icelandic music Sigur Rós <url>"My wallets" My roommate and I decided to watch all of (the good) spongebob again, and so far, it's amazing! I really love this series, and like all of the best jokes and memes come from the first episodes! ` "If I had a dollar for every brain you didn't have, I'd have one dollar!" some will have a cabin, others may just get a berth. in all it is just extra dimensional space. i have plenty of it. "Just use the key on this little door that looks like your standard US Post office and you will be transported to your very own cabin with it's own porthole (scenery not included)." Aw maaan! Being online for a long time the last 2 days and the couple of hours I go offline exciting things happen! Yay! For the Crawfish Mcthundersquish!! The alter ego of Crabbin' Mcthundersquash! Cap'n Lee! It's always good to have news from you! An honor to join into your ranks. Also, I'm glad that roo's 7-foot monster baby does count! And last, just want to share the pride that our cubs page had very close approximations. This is, by far, the most exciting campaign I have been. It really feels like a family. I would have loved to be part of the EK campaign too... And with that, it's good night, cubbies. I'll see you all tomorrow. #FlyTheW On to Wrigley, 1-1. Go Gubs Go! Quarters sounds right Zem already has Berth, so I don't think it would be Bunk. Maybe Quarters Cabin? Bunk? :) What's the nautical term for rooms? It got quiet, time to expand for more rooms on the crawfish. LOL we got lucky it was a quiet day at work! :D and my supervisors didn't care just watched me build :D looks like CubSubCorps is ahead of bearsvsbabies.com in reporting achievements. :-) Hurray, Jenn! You got us all a full achievement on your own, that's something to brag about! ;) ... and updated again with @Roo's 7 foot baby goal. Only 6 more to go! @CB: don't worry. I don't drive anyway and Mike's Hard Lemonade has a low alcohol content (according to my liver anyway). @Elan thank you :) just making sure since earlier some people could see them and others couldn't LOL :) Stretch goals have been updated from Ashley's counts. www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html @ Elan did you guys see my FB pics of a 7ft baby monster and my 2 little sculptures? That's the spirit @Geist. Guzzle away! (after you're done driving, of course) @Geist: Just don't miss your flight. I know I said I wasn't going to drink before the trip but after the day that I have had, screw that. I am getting some Mike's Hard Lemonade and downing the whole pack! CB, good point. I think we're the reason the Cubs are winning! We have this power! Oh wow, 5-0! Go Cubs! Woo! Just booked the first showing of Dr. Strange 3D next thursday! Student day, so I get it $5 off!!! So psyched as shown by the exclamation points!!!!! Hehe, I posted a couple of those comments to the wrong campaign. Probably confusing the heck out of them right now ... ... and now two of us have minions. I claim Cheetos as my minions. (Throws Cheetos at the screen for emphasis.) Part of the difference between this and EK is that there is a lot less roleplaying in the comments. In fact, only one of us even has minions (I'll let you all discover who that is) and it's missing that good/neutral/evil alignmenty. Gummy bears vs sugar babies candy, for someone with friends. Anyone with a baby give them a poorly hand drawn shield and axe, and a taunt speech bubble for good measure and you have one legit baby dressed as tank. Well, the dressing bit is legitimate, I don't know about the baby. I'm wondering about a slightly tall baby monster with 7 feet qualifying as that 7 foot tall baby monster... *waiting excitedly for the newest update* You Gleek you!! @CB... very apropos indeed !! :) @Panda Cub..that's a great idea, I second making Ashley a collaborator to be able to interact with us officially. :) @PC, I totally grok that. Will do. I had only heard of the term used in medicine and dentistry for Gleeking and not to reference for 'Glee' fandom, but something new every day. :) Gleeking is permitted, as long as it is done in the passion of Grokking. We're really movin' now! My high school didn't have a mixed glee club, but I was in the madrigal group my Junior and Senior year. Yeah, Zem. I claimed Gleek the first time I heard it. It is soooo apropos. @Zem, the fact that the crew of the sub is made up of "cubs" is not lost on me. Haha, you know gleek is a word, right CB? And I'm the master of doing it, which is fun to gross people out! Woo! Cubs are 2-0 right now! I wonder if the Indians have any clue just exactly how many people want them to lose this time? ;) @Cha! if I'm a tech nerd and I like Glee, I guess that makes me a Gleek. Thanks Elan. It helps to have an official count so that we don't have to wonder which entries were accepted. Elan Lee, You should make Ashley a collaborator and give her the permission listed below. [ ] Collaborator can comment and mark comments as spam. Then you can task her with interacting with us on your behalf so that you can get back to doing what you do best and that is making this awesome game :-) Please tell her Hi and thank you too! :) Can you update us please yay!! LOL Awesome...someone had the idea of going to a toy store where they sell Pomeranian stuffed animals and clandestinely slipping underwear on it and take a picture... with the physical hashtag note of course Looking forward to cleaning the bear poo off the decks of the Crawfish McThundersquish :D Cool! I get to take the word (estimated) off of that goal. Ahoy, Elan! Oh boy! I mean, 40,000 people must have at least 3 more pomerainians, and some underwear to boot! Uech, speaking of weather, we're going to be bouncing back and forth between about 70 and 80 all week until next monday, when it'll finally calm down to below 70.Thankfully the lows are balancing below 50, which is honestly closer to what our weather should be this time of year. Like lower 60s or so than 82! Whohoo for 'Crawlfish McThundersquish'!! *cuckles* whoops!! It's cold my mind and fingers are not coordinating properly and auto correct is not doing its job Cha!, Ah sure jez, that manages me smile! I didn't know you had an Irish accent! ;) @Zem...interesting!! All good :) @CB.. that manages me smile...you're such a tech nerd :) I actually had that queued up last night. I had the website in one browser tab and the update on my local server in another tab. It was fun switching back and forth between tabs and watching the name change as if by magic. Woohoo! *throws bottles of wine at the sub* And ... done! Welcome aboard the Crawfish McThundersquish. Panda, how about being fancy and using Chateau Margaux 2009, the most expensive wine in the world? Or, more fitting for our budgets, Two Buck Chuck might fit the bill. ;) Panda, we hit $1.5 million yesterday, and just before that, 40,000 backers. ` Cha!, dang it, I almost did it again! I don't mean to mix you up, sorry about that! Did I really do it another time as well? It's just that on this campaign, you're much like Geist has been on the EK side since the campaign, so I guess I just got a bit confused when checking for barely half a second to see who to respond to. Sorry, I'll try not to let it happen again! Crawfish is a fine name now we just need a good vintage wine to cap the Sub with for its maiden voyage :-) Hi, HC! Bye, HC! Thanks for stopping by! CB, yes, I'm going to officially declare it moot, but due to very strong evidence (half the answers before the spam were in favor of Crawfish), Crawfish McThundersquish will be the official title. To the great ire of the one who voted 30 times for Honey Pot, I'm sure. Dr. P, on LZ, see my latest comment on EK. He hasn't been on here for 3 days, but his facebook had an update. Aww well there's plenty to be happy about especially with the Pharrell Happy song and minions :) <url># @Pub Cub...very true but Babies and weapons/war are up there too apart from sex...all sells well. Maybe if it had been Babies vs Bears... @Cha - I was wondering as well why this has sort of plateau'd (if that's a word). I don't remember if EK did this, or if it had momentum all the way through. (Though @PC's got a point about the cat thing...) Bandits 'Another Sad Song' <url>� Bear Paws/ Claws are also a name given to a type of yeast donut sold in some US donut shops (think mainly there, may be called other things or have different forms for that basic idea. Where that name derives from, other than shape, I have no idea.) Hi CubSubs! Sorry I have been 'hibernating' extra these past few days. I haven't forgotten about my lovely crew mates :] I hope everyone is doing well! I love the stretch goals and have been enjoying all the submissions so far (especially my fellow Brit @GC) I'll try to check in more often when I wake up tomorrow x - Elizabeth aka 'Hibernating Cub' /throws chocolates on everyone's pillows @Zem... I hope that's not true. :( It's the 2nd time you mistook me with Geist. Not that Geist is not an awesome person to be mistaken with. *shrugz* awww well Pictures of people sharing bear related food with friends. Bear Paws come in handy packs of 2. Shouldn't be that hard to clinch, I'll sure be posting mine tomorrow! It was in second place, but I agree it looks like someone stuffed the ballot box. @Zem, are we declaring the poll done and disqualifying Honey Pot then? Stretch Goal page has been updated at www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html and we only have to knock off seven more! When did we hit 1.5 million ? i missed that Have we heard from LZ, he doing well? You can also now view Stretch Goals on the campaign page as well. Jenn check the privacy settings on your 7 footer post to make sure it is seen on facebook. GM, Cha, Geist, they're interchangeable really. ;) I also notice that they are updated on the campaign page as well. <url>#BEARSvsBABIES so I hope there are more in Facebook. I think the 5-foot and 7-foot monster baby have been completed but not yet verified. I don't think they count towards the sculpture goal because they are not 'characters' of the game (which also makes difficult to count the sculpture goal) Also, the input for 5-gummy bear stack may have been achieved but not verified, it's difficult to tell so maybe we should keep trying both (5 stack and 7 stack) The most accurate numbers -based on my count of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram- are the following: -11 babies disguised as bears -16 sculptures (maybe less because I just noticed the part 'based on characters of the game') -1 bearded baby (idk why the page says we have 4, maybe because of those without the note) -6 pomeranians -13 cats -2 BvB themed pumpkins -0 baby tanks -0 pumpkin giving birth -0 friend-sharing bvb-themed food As already stated, there appears to be more of everything but I'm counting only those with a HAND-written note @Zem... did you restrict the voting to one entry per IP address? And even then people can use multiple devices, get others to vote. To clarify, not that long ago, I checked and mentally noted the tallies. Then, since then (maybe an hour), Honey Pot spiked and the rest haven't changed at all except maybe the Cub Sub getting 1-2 votes. Okay... okay, something is wrong here. Go look at the statistics for the Cub Sub name. <url>"The Honey Pot" got around 29 votes, while the rest didn't change. In addition, there are 3 hot spots on the map. New York is a collection of several votes, but London and Chicago both have the most votes in a single location, so I'd say it likely came from one of those. Someone found out they can vote more than once and spammed the poll. ` The two options are to scrap this one or to go with what the results were before that, and I happened to pay close attention, with Crawfish at 16, Honey Pot at 8 or 9, and the rest inconsequential last I checked, which was apparently just before the spam. Neither of them came to the party, but with how they both disappeared immediately after or even just before the end of EK, I expect we won't be hearing too much from them. [The Man] and [Wicked Felina] haven't made a return either. Have we ever heard from Blondie or Professor F? Calc was here the first day or two, but checked back out after that. I can't imagine there are that many wars being fought over math right now. Ex Prez was here this morning. I'm still wondering how General Calculus is doing. Yeah, that's a good point. Where is HC? We miss you! At least this has brought up a bunch of old, missing friends and given us some great new ones! Hopefully they can count for both :D Rather, could they? Do the 5' and 7' (was there a 10'?) baby monsters count towards our 25 baby sculpture construction one? I miss @HC too @CB, hopefully she'll be back soon! (We need to go back and recount too..... so glad we finished with the haiku) We've been keeping our own count though, and we're doing well. <url>"Hibernating Cub?" She was so active here last week and now I don't see her posting at all. The last I saw of her was on the Fidget Cube project talking about how negative it had become. Please come back. We need chocolates! Elan Lee 2-time Creator Superbacker about 2 hours ago Hey guys, sorry to be so silent over here. We've kept her heads down and have been busily building this campaign. I'll try to hop on here from time to time to answer any questions you have, so keep them coming, and thank you for all of your support! @Zem: It was only about an hour ago, possibly bit more...not sure when I last refreshed this page. Wait, he visited here today? I didn't go back to most of the comments earlier because I missed so many. Dang it, I missed that! It is a great group effort over all. So @Elan popped in earlier and is happy to answer any questions we may have. Sooo what questions do we have for Elan? Maybe other than the usual about how many cards, how big the box, does it fit sleeved cards, where does it ship to, will it cost me VAT etc... Thank you @Zem and @Dr.P :) Poppet was a true trooper. Though Jenn and Aether are doing really well too, maybe even out pacing here in terms of category entries. Cha! is doing a great job! I wouldn't have thought to use a box. LOL I have cats just no costumes LOL It is a really good stealth fighter. Cha! is winning in terms of total submissions! (Most of mine have been haiku....) Cha!, When I saw it, I understood and really liked it. The cat is so stealthy it takes half a minute to even make it out on the picture! What are our (the cubsub group's) counts on things? Do we have anymore good gummy bear stacks (with notes)?!?! Maybe for the next tier there will be a category for pictures of "Babies with muts for steeds!" though that isn't exactly catchy.... Ack...I was afraid it may not be clear. Poppet is actually sitting in a box I shaped like a jet fighter with a thin jacket wrapped around and just her head sticking out of the hole. I couldn't really get a more frontal pic as it all happened in the bathtub. And I was going for the Nighthawk jetfighter from Skunk Works shape. I do my research ;) Everybody remember: <url>"Bearded Shark Baby" <url>"U-Boot Shark" Oatmeal liked my "Rice & Saw Bear" so that one is hopefully counted <url>"F42 Nightkitty" and I hope it will count as a 'cloaked' cat jetfighter <url>` You don't need to be a crew member to voter, but we'll be glad to add anyone who wants to join the crew! add mini pins and pit bulls to that list too LOL :D Unless poodles and Chihuahuas are included in Stretch Goal 2 ... @Cap'n Lee: hint, hint @Dr. P, if there is a poodleception, there must also be a Chihuahuaception. Arf! Maybe there can be a poodlception? A poodle with pom-poms loosely tied around its ears isn't a Pomeranian? Awww, darn. :P Oh, that makes sense Pub Cub. But usually that isn't too hard to tell. Sometimes a bad picture is a bad picture, I suck at taking pictures myself (takes me forever to get a good shot in). That is an option Alto, a stuff pomeranian group shot! I might grab a pick with my dog..... but she is by no means a pomeranian.... #sadpanda Oh, I mean just make a note of what you're trying to do in your photo in the description. Most people would tend to do this anyways, but I saw acouple images with the stacked gummies where I had a hard time determining which they were going for. Of course, they didn't have the visible hashtags, either. :/ Then there is that.... we get quite jibberjabbery, so things get buried easily. There used to be a stuffed pomeranians in the stuffed animal section at Toys R Us just saying if someone had one close to them and put underwear on 10it could be a quick acheivement. Nearest one to me is over an hour away or I would. Been off tidying things up aboard ship and I come back to 26 new comments! There would have to be a general agreed upon #hashtag for it to be of use though, that isn't necessarily easy unless the team themselves establish that kind of a thing. Or we agree to do that as a group, which is hard to do with there being 40K+ of us. That is optional though Pub Cub... though it certainly makes finding them and sorting through them easier. I did a rough count of Haiku yesterday just to see what the team was in for (and because I was really liking them....), and that was intense. Glad we finished that one already, but I did notice the #haiku help me sift through better. Good idea!...just add to the physical hashtag note BVe sure to note which challenge you're trying to meet, as well, so it makes recognition easier, in case anyone is looking for it. Comes in handy when you are trying to decipher whether something meets the 5 foot vs. 7 foot Monstrous Baby challenge, for example. ;) The fun part is that there's lots of flexibility to be create and just have a good time. Didn't someone make those cup cakes...that could have been a photo op eating them too! Dr P that is good, forgot about Bear Claws Do bear claws and baby food count towards that? Because I ain't no Cub-Cake, any cookies I make will look more AvP than BvB. Cuzz I can drop a few babies and a bear plastic figure in food, but not sure if that would count LOL Yes! That would be great Jolene! =D Yay for teamwork!! :D and thank you all for helping! I'd like to see a few examples of the food sharing one :) And that's awesome that you'll be able to do so many different ones! To be on the safe side, two pics will be best :) Please do not forget the physical hashtag note! I was thinking 2 separate pics @jolene Alto maybe two stacks? a 5 and a 7? I wonder if I can do separate pics of my baby (who sleeps like a log) with both 5 and 7 gummy bears? We did the bear suit this morning and I should be able to do the beard pic as well tonight. If I can con my husband into it give his cat enough cat nip to be able to put wings on it to make it a fighter jet cat. Hi @Elan! No worries, good to hear from you! Enjoying the stretch goals! I count only 2 bearsVSbabies-themed pumpkins with the handwritten note. but it's ok, that one requires time, so maybe we will see more in the next days. Looks great @Callum! I'll be sharing some BvB themed food in a bit :) soo close :D I strongly believe that we all can complete the following tasks within the next 24 hrs: 11 more sculptures (There was another valid pic on twitter made with rice a couple of minutes ago) picture of 5 gummy bears in baby picture of 7 gummy bears in baby 12 more jet-cats 4 more pomeranians 14 more babies disguised as bears providing the 5-foot tall monster baby and 7-foot tall monster baby is verified, we would need 2 additional tasks. I thinks there are many pumpkins out there. Let me count! @callum, yours is great!! Just finished my Jet shark pumpkin! Check it out! <url>"Public". They need to be set to Public to be searchable by those who aren't on your "Friends" list. Besides that I think people with babies should focus on the gummy bears, there are lots of pictures there but without the handwritten note or with too many gummy bears. Maybe we should try exactly 5 and exactly 7 WITH the handwritten note. The one sharing bearsvsbabies themed food with a friend (and a note) hasn't been very active. I think people are not understanding that one clearly (myself included) but if it's what I think it should be easy: Grab a gummy bear or a teddy graham's cookie and give it to a friend, take a selfie (handwritten note included) and voilà! @CB indeed. For this round of stretch goals 5 of the 20 tasks will be set aside. I haven't seen through the periscope more than 1 tank baby (and I don't recall if there was a handwritten note). There are themed pumpkins and bearded babies but not too many. The picture of 50 people together dressed as babies/bears it's a difficult one (maybe in future rounds or in halloween it may be completed though). @Zem what's not true? Thanks @Aether. Keeping track of these counts may not seem like much, but it really helps everyone to stay on track to have a good estimate of exactly where we are and how far we need to go to meet our goals. Mine is like 2 miles away from me, which is weird because I think I had given my nearly exact address, or at least that I was in the university. Ah, I just went to the KC site and looked at the map. So many memories! So many missed crewmembers! So many names that poked out when I noticed them though I hadn't seen them in over a year! @Zem: That's kind of creepy...I just looked at it, and zoomed in on the one around me...and it takes me to a street south of my office. I love looking at the map on the survey and seeing where all these votes are coming from! Remember the KC map? That was awesome! Cub Sub official name voting final round! <url>` You don't need to be a crew member to voter, but we'll be glad to add anyone who wants to join the crew! ` ` Wow, yeah, no kidding Aether! A full page in less than 2 hours! Man, I wish I could be here in the mornings! Especially since that'd also mean I could sleep through the mornings. ;) @Zem don't worry chief of spam, there has been enough activity here. ;) TEP! Hi, how are you! Long, long time, no see! Ahoy to everyone else as well. ` Clayton, that's not true at all. What?! @CB understood! Btw, I counted again (this time with paper and pen) and found 3 extra babies and (total of 11), 2 extra jet-cats (total of 12). Sorry I'm late, I woke up at my alarm and then slept in half an hour, so I couldn't check in here at all. Oh, by the way, @Aether Tower, please call me "Cheetah Cub." KickStarter won't let me put that as part of my name, but everyone knows me as @CB. @Aether, that's why I mark nearly everything as (estimated) until we actually get word from Cap'n Lee. @mike it is. :) Hopefully there are more pics out there that we are still missing. Like what happened with the haikus, our count was lower than 1K but when the update came, that task was considered completed. Thanks @Aether. Check the totals on www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html and make sure I got it right. My roommate had the flag costume for her puppy. It worked perfectly. :) a lot of tuna was involved And the hashtag note is required..... so many good entries without it. But they made that point clear unfortunately. lol Leo Representin' too! On other news, I looked through the periscope on facebook, twitter and instagram for pictures with the hashtag note and I found out the following: 8 babies disguised as bears. 12 sculptures 10 very handsome jet-cats (including Cub-Cake's) 6 incredible pomeranians with incredible underpants Maybe the search engine didn't display all the results because I think those are really low numbers but on the other hand, there are a LOT of pictures without the hashtag note try now? I tagged and added more # OK, got it. I can read the hashtag in one of the closeup images in the same album. I just posted my own kitty fighter pilot on twitter! @sugarwhippednyc :) @Mike there are more photos along with it somewhere. One of them has a close up of the hashtag :) Thanks @Aether, I finally found it. Looks good too. I can't read the post-it note with the hashtag though. @Mike - I went through the posts of the #BEARSVSBABIES thing, and found something else that she had put up. Aether's link works though, that's probably a much easier way of finding it! ;) @Roo that's great! thanks, sorry for the inconvenience but hopefully they will be easier to find :) @Mike maybe this helps? <url>#BEARSVSBABIES (looks really cool BTW Roo!) - couldn't see it on the hashtag itself. BUT I am on my phone, so I don't know if that is affecting it. My phone has been known to do silly things. TBH, I'm not really sure how the whole hashtag thing works on FB, so that probably doesn't help! Any chance you can put the social stretch goals on the front page? Ah well, I'll just have to take everyone's word for it because I still don't see it. @Aether just added the hashtag to all the pics @Creeper: I'm sitting here, in my office, with my fan going, while everyone else is saying their offices are freezing(I don't touch the thermostat because I know they would yell at me...but it's too hot otherwise for me). @Mike That's because Roo added the pictures to an album of hers named #bearsvsbabies where she uploaded the scene swap pictures, some sculptures and now the monster. I noticed and wrote a comment on the individual picture of the full-size 7-foot monster baby but the other pictures (the close ups where she proves the size of the monster and the post-it) would need a comment with the hashtag too so they can be easier to find within the hashtag page. @Mike not to sure, but I see it :) <url>"working" but have yet to complete a task. Work tonight at the restaurant. I'm also freezing my ass off becuase I spoil Leonidas. He kept meowing to go up in his catio. So the window is wide-open, he's sitting up there like a little king... and I'm covered in a giant blanket. Why can't I find Roo's photo when I search for #BEARSVSBABIES on Facebook? Hiya Cub-Cake! How's the day going? Hiya Potatten. :) oh right! thanks Dr P. I forgot to look it up in the rest of the pictures It's next to the baby's head AT (Referring to Jenn Roo pic) @Aether thank you :) hmmm although, I can't find the hashtag note on the picture... @roo I commented the hashtag on the individual image so it could be more visible in facebook search engine because I noticed the foto was added in an album and that made it somewhat difficult to find. But not anymore! :) @cub-cake, it shouldn't be too hard for you to do. It's just herding cats. That's great Roo!! Another challenge completed! ok did my best (while at work) to do a 7ft baby monster LOL LOL it's on FB All you need to do is create it, set it up somewhere close to where they normally go, and wait patiently. I"m making one for Leo. The backyard kitties won't let me come close! Even if we have completed that goal, it would still be awesome. You should make a cardboard airplane for them...just saying. >.> ...there are currently 5 cats in my backyard, fyi. GM - My friend is in NY that i haven't seen in a long time. She wanted to hang out. I asked her if she minded just coming to my apartment, we sit up in bed and watch tv and color. She's quite excited. Adulting does suck...I want to go back to my blanket fort and colour(got my colouring books from a KS campaign earlier this week...) my friend is getting felt and making a beard for her baby as we speak. I told her to do it, include the #, and to NOT ASK QUESTIONS stupid rent and bills. Stupid adulting. @Creeper: Morning! And yes, work does have a way of intruding on fun time. Hi Ex- Nice to see you. I understand your plight with that whole "work" thing. Been tough trying to keep up to date on this! Good Morning! Morning everyone! Forgot to notify what was seen in the periscope: an ex-presidential boat approaching to the sub with a figure I don't know but looking like an ex-president... anyway, glad you made it! Morning cubs! Hey Ex! Hi, @Ex-President. I hope you will be joining the crew. Do you have a particular crew assignment that you'd prefer? You can look at www.cubsubcorps.com to see what other people have chosen. Anything nautical that's not listed is still up for grabs. Thanks Cha! Will submit my registration when I can. This thing called 'work' is starting to interfere with my kickstarter/EK/BvB time. @Mike Kabala I'm from Des Moines, but forever a Hawkeye fan (except for basketball, then it's ISU all the way). they have forced the riverly between Nebraska and Iowa so it is pitiful now. I heard Nebraska may want to go back to the Big 12 since they are not as dominate in the Big 10 as they thought they would be. Ups <url>#BearsVsBabies hashtag on it. There have been several good entries that have neglecyed to include it. :( The reason, of course, is that they need to make sure that the stunts have been performed specifically for the game and not just something someone has found on the web, somewhere and are submitting as their own. (It happens quite often.) <url>` You don't need to be a crew member to voter, but we'll be glad to add anyone who wants to join the crew! Note: Crabbin' McThundersquash has been removed by a vote in the comments due to keeping it original and separate from the goal at this point, but Crawfish McThundersquish is there to take its place. Night chief engineer and chief bard. I'll keep watch in the periscope if anything arises. I'm still awake because I re-made the 5-foot tall monster baby to prove its size :) I added her a horn and eyes Marilyn Manson 'Sweet Dreams Are Made Of This' <url># @CB... I'm with you and you are just fine the way you are!! :) I'm off to bed too... OK, one last comment and I'm REALLY going to bed. @Cha, you find yourself admitting to a lot of things when you pass 60. At my age, very little embarrasses me any more. You all know that I like Polka and that I'm a Cubs fan. ... OK that last one doesn't have the same ring to it this year as it has most of my life. Good Night @CB QUEEN 'Another One Bites The Dust' <url># @Aether... I know, I know it's all about the stretch goals ;) "Watched" Glee. Its best episodes were before everyone graduated. @Cha You're welcome, no need to thank for, though, your tweets are great besides the fact of contributing to the stretch goals =) @Aether... just mixing it up some. :) Thank you for Twitter following and liking my tweets :) Why did the comments have to pick up right at bedtime? @CB... uh oh you watch Glee ;) Twisted Sister 'We're Not Gonna Take It' <url># Every time I hear a Journey song I feel like I'm watching an episode of Glee. Thanks for tonight's tunes! I love getting cool, cute, crazy t-shirts! :) Poison 'Nothin' But A Good Time <url># Can't say I was ever a Huskers fan, especially since I went to Iowa State. Funny thing is, every year it was considered a given that Nebraska would dominate College Football. I hardly hear about them since they switched conferences several years ago. I warned ya I'd drop some 80s hair something on ya Journey 'Any Way You Want It' <url># Oh ah, I supported that campaign too. Love Simon'S Cat. I just got the t-shirt and book. Like watching those BvB numbers roll by Daft Punk 'Get Lucky' <url># @Cha! I got him as a perk from an Indiegogo campaign. He arrived in a cardboard cat carrier with a fabric and velcro cone around his neck. It all fit into the theme of "Off to the Vet." He's adorable ... for a cat. Wait, put the link up here so I can see. I can't find your twitter. CB, I haven't really cared much for baseball in years, but this series is incredible! I'm so into it again! Man, between the Cubs in the series again and the Huskers having an amazing season for the first time in 15 years, I've never cared more about sports! Just a bit of halloweeny The Living Tombstone - 'Spooky Scary Skeletons remix' <url># @CB... why is your stuffed Simon's Cat wearing a cone? @Zem, just be cool and act like it was supposed to happen so that the Cubs could get a good, close-up look at the opposition. Remember, Game 5 is at Wrigley Field. Kenny Loggins 'Danger Zone' <url># Cappuccino got lucky. He was scheduled for the fighter jet mission, but when the field was limited to cats, Simon's Cat took his place. Being a stuffed cat, he was much more compliant. He was also happy to have his cone removed for a while. Dang you, Indians! You win... this time. I hope they know how many people are rooting against them right now. WOO 1.5 MILLION AND 40,000 ALL IN ONE DAY HUZZAH sorry, I was watching something but I'm back now just in time to leave again. And Poppet (purring on my tummy) has forgiven me for making her go on the jet fighter mission :) Just because... U-Boot Shark <url>"The One" , but wind up making it impossible for the two, three or whatever pledgers to never really know. Maybe it is better that way. :) If we reach $1.5 million in funding and no one is here to see it ... does it make a sound? c o n f e t t i $1.5 million ... mic drop. @Zem, I've updated the link on the News page. Too bad KS won't let you edit or delete comments. Kevin, N64, of course! The best gaming system ever! ` Yeah, CB, make sure you get the second poll. Hmm ... the link seems to have changed. Use this one instead. <url>#BearsvsBabies Haha, posted the first tweet without photo, Poppet was very stealthy indeed. <url>"Dave The Quack" - the link is www.bearsvsbabies.com/stretch Cub Sub official name voting final round! <url>` Note: Crabbin' McThundersquash has been removed by a vote in the comments due to keeping it original and separate from the goal at this point. Sally, it's inflatable, though, so almost no volume! And what about for food then?... @dns12999 "Dave The Quack" thanks for posting that. I was so busy updating the www.cubsubcorps.com website from that page I forgot to post the link to the "official" page. Apparently(forgive me if you already know this) there is an official site for our completed streach goals bearsvsbabies.com/streach @Clayton LOL I have 4 cats @jenn I have no cats or costumes. I will have to borrow the neighbors cat...if i can catch him that is. More pages added to www.cubsubcorps.com Contact Us: www.cubsubcorps.com/contact.html Press: www.cubsubcorps.com/press.html Kickstarter page Kicktraq page congrats!! nice work! Woooow! apparently our 5-foot baby is good enough!! @gameofbabies twitter account retweeted it (and followed @aethertower account, that just made my day, week and month!) I have cats just no costumes LOL Agreed, the most organized backer group to achieve stretch goals ever, lol @clayton yes. But maybe by the 2nd round we can be more organized. We already know who can write, or use photoshop, has babies, etc. Maybe we should record certain skills on the page? for example, with me you can count with music composition, photoshop, and a pomeranian. :) I know 'Roo' can make images too. In that way, we could work faster by not having to repeat the same tasks. Just an idea, though If there was snow on the ground it would be a lot easier to make the big monsters I will try to make a 7ft baby either tonight or tomorrow LOL Have to find a tape measure to prove height lol oh god, i just realized this is only round 1 of stretch goals. we have 2 more rounds to complete. although, we only need 15 of the 20 items, so 10 more to go. could work :D possibly, looks like a baby monster to me. Spent the last hour in my attempt for a 5-foot monstruous baby... do you think this will do? <url>` Note: Crabbin' McThundersquash has been removed by a vote in the comments due to keeping it original and separate from the goal at this point. Zem, loved the bio. that is a great series. where do we go to see whats been marked off? Ahoy, Dave! Nice of you to drop by! So it's settled. Several people have chimed in, unanimously for the removal of the Crabbin' option. @dns i would say yes, plus they have marked it off as completed. I tagged with #Bearsvsbabies and catsdressedasfighterjets I can't find your post Caitlin did you tag your tweet with #BearsVsBabies? I notice Elan liked a boat renamed crabbin mcthundersquatch I think that makes it complete for sure no? somewhere out there people on twitter have no clue what #bearsvsbabies is and they are totally confused why we are tearing up twitter with the hashtag and all these different things. Looks like we're making good progress! Just posted 2 pictures of 2 of my cats as fighter jets, I'll try to talk my 3rd cat into it but he is afraid of the wings. They are on Twitter and their names are Butterscotch and Rudolph if you want to see the pictures. How very handy thanks Mike @dns12999 "Dave The Quack" Your questions are answered in the links I just posted. Look on the Stretch Goals and FAQ pages. Posting these again so people don't have to scroll down so far: CubSub Corps Main page: www.cubsubcorps.com FAQ page: www.cubsubcorps.com/FAQ.html News page: www.cubsubcorps.com/news.html Stretch Goals page: www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html Howdy folks. I wish I could be more attentive but it's hard with a 3 year old and a 1 year old. What achievements have we completed? Any work from Captain Elan? @Zem yes!! I liked yours a lot too! I read it yesterday! Hilarious @Everyone, you can have a bio too. All you have to do is write one and post it here addressed to @CB (subject to editing, of course. Don't worry, i'll make it look good for you. It's not about censorship.) CB, I like the new job titles too. Man, you're doing great work with the site! It's awesome and gets better every time! Keep it up! CB, don't worry, Crawfish will be the only variation. ` Aether, that's really good! I love it! Check out my bio, it's one of my favorite excerpts from my favorite series ever. Aww, I was kind of liking the ligature. :-( @Mike Cool! Only that I should have omitted the character 'Æ' if it's not too much trouble, maybe replace it with 'Ae' here: Aether Tower Being ethereally present in many planes of the multiverse, the Aether Tower sensed something unlike anything else: a war between God-Awful / Incredible-looking BEARS vs God-Awful / Incredible-looking BABIES. In the proximity, an interesting group of cubs inside a giant submarine kept watch over it, supporting Bears and Babies alike. The Aether Tower materialized to become a cub, join the crew as a Mate and help the cubs to achieve their goal of accomplishing great things for Cap'n Lee. It wasn't long before Aether Tower was promoted to Periscope Mate because of an innate ability to perceive things of which the other cubs were unaware. Dang! Jut when I thought Crawfish was gaining momentum, a host of variations popped up! Let's end voting RIGHT NOW before any of the other names can catch up. :-) :-) :-) Æther Tower now has a bio posted. Just click on the name. I thought about making it a separate poll, but I figured I'd just ask here. I think when I make the final poll, I'll take it off and have a note about why. Ooh, where's Creeper? She can bake bear and baby foods to share AND can dress Leonidas up as a jet fighter! Silverfish McLightningcucumber? Awesome on the stretch goal update! I was hoping I still get to submit my photo entries WITH physical hashtag note. And I have an idea on the cat fighter Not sure Poppet will be cooperative... @Jenn: Half a pizza with items a bear would eat on it, and half with items a baby would eat. Cut the pizza to look like a bear/baby/bear eating a baby. Finally done with work. Welcome new SubCubCorps crew members! :) I'm willing to add stuff to my pizza to share if I know it would count LOL just not sure about that one :( Post 25 photos of you sharing Bears vs Babies themed food items with friends animal crackers? bear/baby shaped cookies with you and 25 of your friends? Post 25 photos of you sharing Bears vs Babies themed food items with friends--- Would this be like anything with a baby or bear or random animal on it? bc all I've seen is the cat/taco combo Mantis Shrimp McThundersquash? Crawdaddy McThundersquash? lol, maybe make another poll to remove the name from this poll? @Zem: I think since we did get the Crabbin' achievement, it should be removed from the list. I agree LOL Aye So is everyone in agreement? I want as many people to input on this option before going on with the next and final round of voting. The following changes have been made in crew assignment: Extradimensional Fiddler Clayton Smith Periscope Mate Aether Tower I think Crabbin' McThundersquash should be removed because of our little rat buddy already named like that. But I kinda like Crawfish McThundersquish for being a result (and kind of an alter ego/big brother/familiar) of Crabbin' @Zem I would say yes. we don't need two McThundersquash names competing. Just to bring this back up, should we remove Crabbin' McThundersquash in favor of simplicity, creativity, singularity, and Crawfish McThundersquish? Crabbin' is a major thing, and the only reason that was a title was because it might get us the stretch goal which has been gotten, so we should have something light and funny to play off of that, a sort of play on words. And Crawfish McThundersquish just sounds funny! @Sally T best job description ever!! Thankfully Halloween is here so we can stalk people on the street, get permission, hold up a hashtag, and take pics to post LOL LOL @Sally T, if the crew gets anywhere close to39,645 we will need a few more Engineer's Mates to type in all of the crew assignments! ;-) We beat all but like two, and they were the really high sub-count ones for like facebook or twitter. It was an impressive effort, and I'm glad we're starting to burn through them here too! The "You're dead to me. Unless you rub my belly." face. Yeah, I remember we just bearly made a few of them last time! It was down to the wire! ` Man, I was wrong, THIS is the busiest time of the day here! Who would have thought early-mid afternoon?! If they are extra fancy underpants it might count Aether... but your dog already had the "I hope you're happy" kind of look in the last one. The group photos will be hard to accomplish for sure. That one was intense last time. We got it done thanks to a CON of some kind (comic-con?) contributing to our effort. (100 people, 1 pic) Yes, I thought those 1K haikus were gonna be finished by tonight! We are still missing pomeranians D: If I could put on different incredible underpants to mine but I don't think it will count beyond the 1st. i was impressed we got the 1000 done so fast, but I am not arguing. some of these will be harder to get done. Is Bears vs Babies EU friendly? Yes. Bears vs Babies will be the same as Exploding Kittens. The product with NOT be shipping to the EU from the US, it will be shipping to the UK first and then to customers in the UK and EU. To clarify, if you are in the UK, you will not pay any VAT. If you are in the EU, you will not pay any VAT either. We knocked those haiku out of the park...... They will probably explain their ruling. @CB Æther Tower bio: "Being ethereally present in many planes of the multiverse, the Æther Tower sensed something unlike anything else: A war between God-Awful/Incredible-looking BEARS vs God-Awful/Incredible-looking BABIES. In the proximity, an interesting group of cubs inside of a submarine kept watch of it and supported Bears and babies alike. So the Æther Tower materialized a generic mate to become a cub, join the watch and the help the cubs to achieve great things of Cap'n Lee's desire." Change anything you see fit. ;) Well, that's really on them. There were somereally awesome ones, but they forgot the #hashtag note Technically speaking...shouldn't the "10 or more gummies on a sleeping baby" count for the previous two? Since it does say "or more" :P ohh, extradimensional fiddling. i like that job, it can include physics and made up numbers Guys check it out! They update the goal markers! <url>` On a related note, should we remove Crabbin' McThundersquash in favor of simplicity, creativity, singularity, and Crawfish McThundersquish? Crabbin' is a major thing, and the only reason that was a title was because it might get us the stretch goal which, to the best of my knowledge, has been gotten, so we should have something light and funny to play off of that, a sort of play on words. @Aether Tower, I already grabbed your description, so all I need is your bio. You can just post it here and address it to @CB if you like. alright! do you prefer me to move this topic to the e-mail? (for the bio and description) @Aether Tower, how about "Periscope Mate?" ...or alternatively, you know, the person who actually uses the periscope :P @Sally T, want to join the drew? Check the FAQ to find out how. www.cubsubcorps.com/FAQ.html @Mike If it is possible, then sure! I'm really passionate about BvB. The only thing is that I use the creator account for everything in Kickstarter rather than a personal account. Would that be an issue? [Breaking 4th wall] There's a person in here behind the screen, sometimes William, sometimes Juan, but [/Breaking 4th wall] I'm an ethereal tower of creation so, maybe I could be the ethereal periscope of the submarine/pole of the ship? My job would be to seek on the distance for anything which may be useful for the crew's achievements. I voted without knowing I must be a member. I suppose I could use the title "Berserker Cub," and maybe accept the job of security. Wow, I like that tracking grid! I haven't had time to catch up on the progress so it is awesome to see that people have been keeping track. And oops, I voted on that poll too. Maybe it's all getting skewed by us non-members... Movie swaps: Facebook: Jenn B "Roo (10) Twitter: @wilbossman (1), @alanFlyer (1), @aethertower (2) I did 10 movie swaps on FB :) I am showing we have around 13 movie swaps so far. but then i might not have found them all either. @Aether Tower ... want to join the crew? Oh! Great! I will check the requisites on the page Chief Zem Five stretch goals have already been achieved! www.cubsubcorps.com/StretchGoals.html Oh great, Aether, now there's no option! You have to be made a member! Look what you did! ;) Thanks Jenn! I voted (once) but I'm not a crew member. Was that inappropriate/illegal? @Aether I don't have Twitter to like your pic, but you did a great job!! :) Wow, 40 votes?! We don't have that many crew members... who's voting 16 times? Just a reminder, you can vote for the official vessel name of the Cub Sub! <url>#hashtag note! emailed and posted on FB a few pics LOL hopefully they help :) i wish they made gummy babies that you could stack on a sleeping bear...or maybe not such a good idea, lol Good catch on the 10/50 achievement CB. That is something I missed myself, and I was there for the EK ones! Those are pictures of a group of 10 people and a group of 50 people as an assortment of babies and bears.... that would be a fun idea for a Halloween party. I have this intense desire to watch [Labyrinth] as well for some reason.... I also noticed that some of people are posting photos of individual adults dressed as bears or babies without the hashtag #BEARSVSBABIES. Please take not that ALL 10 or ALL 50 people have to be in the same photo and someone has to be holding up the hashtag. Keep up the effort, folks. I'm trying to put u some counts on the Stretch Goals page, but it's hard when people keep posting comments about indivivual posts but nothing that includes actual counts except Dr. P's haiku count. (Thanks for that, @Dr. P.) @Aether... I commend you on your will power :) glad you liked it @Tyler that would be great @Clayton this one's for Ted <url>¯\_(ツ)_/¯ or swap out Ted with a baby, lol hmmm... if anyone is photoshop expert, 3 men and a baby would look great with a bear cub instead. And that's another haiku down on twitter ;-) Now here's my haiku, For when Babies Attack you, Just use Pooh bear poo @Aether... shame, Coco deserves a special treat for taking one for the team :) Just a reminder, Vote for the official vessel name of the Cub Sub! <url># Uploaded yesterday night :) Pomeranian (Coco) in incredible underpants: <url>#2 now to make it easier to keep track of what is what as we begin tracking our accomplishments. @Zem You're welcome for unintentionally reminding you to keep the poll on top! (I didn't reply yesterday night so your comment could stay on top ;) And yeeeeeees Guitar Hero III is the best of all!! Now I want to hear Cliffs of Dover but it won't be okay to hear it without Cha officially posting it first. 29 votes already! It's coming along nicely! Speaking of which: ` Vote for the official vessel name of the Cub Sub! <url>` ` gotta keep that up top so people see it. CB, I might be making a second round of voting with the top 2 or 3 options, and I think I'll ask people here if we should keep the Crabbin' option in or just stick with Crawfish. After all, once we're updated, the name goal was met by at least that rat yesterday, if not dozens more, so if everyone agrees, we can stick to the funny version. I don't have time to count submissions and maintain the website. Also, we need to verify which submissions have been accepted by Cap'n Lee. I'm working on getting that information as soon as possible, but we need to wait for Elan. Otherwise, we're just guessing. PLEASE put a card or Post-it note with the hashtag #BEARSVSBABIES printed or written on it in ALL of the photos you submit. It won't count otherwise! Since the movie scene needs to be Photoshopped anyway, I think it's OK to photoshop the hashtag in there as well, but NOT for the ones where you need to take an original photo. For those, there needs to be a physical object with the hashtag actually written on it. FWIW, I don't think posting a haiku here counts. It has to be posted on Twitter, Facebook, or other social media. anyone know how many we have completed at least? @Tom, I'm still looking for volunteers to count haikus, etc. So far, no takers though. @Zem, I think you should remove "Crabbin' McThundersplash" from the voting. It is only there in case we need it to meet the stretch goal. We probably shouldn't use it at all once someone gives his baby/pet/boat that name. @Tom: Elan and team do keep track of it. It may take a little longer for us to get confirmation of a goal being met, but they do keep track. anyone keeping track of our challenges ? feel like we will get a delayed update which will set us behind for other stretch goals ? Aaw man, Crawfish McThundersquish is falling behind! I really like that option! The Crabbin' McThundersquash goal was already achieved by the miracle rat, we can make a play on words that sounds cute and funny! Wait, am I really campaigning/advocating for the silly "official" name of a fictitious yellow submarine carrying pirate bears?! Wow... I'm with this guy: <url>俳句 high-koo) are short three-line poems with a 5-7-5 syllable structure that use sensory language to capture a feeling or image. ... Hmmm sensory language...I think I may be overthinking this... @Ginger Cub ...happy carving! :) Here is my Haiku: <url>är' <url>Ärzte "Männer sind Schweine" <url>` Thanks for reminding me to keep that up top, Aether! Also, I know, I thought of Guitar Hero III as well! It's my favorite one, and one of two I ever really played much. I know the entire list inside and out! Oh, for a second I thought you were a fellow musician like me. Great theme to go to sleep! Huge fan of Hans Zimmer and specially THAT theme. @Aether... no, I just love music and especially themed explorations :) lol Crawfish Mcthundersquish is an epic name! Time to sleep <url># We tune those songs in the morning when we start to work and have a long list of songs =) Arsonist's Lullabye is a gem! You post all these songs late at night when nobody is here. Join us during the day, or as I like to call it, fun time! Also, Even Flow would almost beat out the song I have in my head, Momentum, a christian rock/metal song by Tobymac, a great rapper/rocker/metallurgist (?), but I think really the Kirby's Dream Course song from a youtube video of it I'm watching beats them all out. Or maybe I'll end up going back YET AGAIN to Piggy in the Middle by the Rutles for the 200th time this week alone! I don't care, it's a really good, catchy, and funny song! Soundgarden 'Fell On Black Days' <url># Frozen Plasma 'Foolish Dreams' <url>"Vessel names" story on the newa page at www.cubsubcorps.com for your convenience. Thank you @Zem :) Heck, I did it before he even volunteered me. wait...am i a cub too? can i vote on the straw poll? if so i really like the bendy straws best. Vote for the official vessel name of the Cub Sub! <url>� <url>"unofficial" FAQ on www.cobsobcorps.com ASAP. Ashley, yes, they check every backer's twitter individually. If you want the 30 or so extra cards, you need to write 1,000 haikus yourself by the end of the campaign, not to mention the dozens of pictures. I'm only about halfway there. You get into a kind of groove after three or four hundred. Cha!, as in forgot the physical hashtag? Oooh... SHAME! But wait, you made it out of rice and saws? The commandment that the hashtag needs to be physically in the photo? Can you draw up a note and retake the photo, Cha!? I'm confused, I need to do each stretch goal myself? Like I alone would need to post 1,000 bear haikus on my own? Or is the whole crowd working together? @Zem, I'm still waiting tor someone to step up and conduct the voting for the vessel name. Man *sad face* I just made such an awesome Rice & Saw Bear and in my excitement totally I forgot about the first commandment ... grrr... well have to be a practice bear. Maybe tomorrow... Oh yeah, I forgot we had a list of the names! I think, at least for now, Crabbin' McThundersquash should be just fine. @Tom Karbowski, want to join the crew on the CubSub? Zem, sorry, bad link. www.cubsubcorps.com/news.html @Tom Karbowski, I have started a stretch goal page at www.cubsubcorp.com/StretchGoals.html but I need everyone's help posting accurate counts on that page. @Zem, I have added Crawfish McThundersquish to the list of possible vessel names. it's on the news page at www.cubcubcorps.com/news.html down toward the bottom of the page. Thanks for submitting it. I'm glad I came up with something to make you laugh on this stressful day. Tom, the Team is for us. ` Hmm, what do we call them now? They're more than just the "EK (exploding kittens) Team", but you can't say the "EK/BvB Team" because that's just a mouthful. I just say the Team, but that's not descriptive enough for someone who doesn't know them like that. I thought it was he, and he WAS on here in the beginning (where'd he go off to? Are there really that many wars over math?), but it'd be an interesting feature! anyone keeping track of the goals? @Zem, I think that might have been General Calculus. Oh yeah, I move we rename the vessel the Crawfish McThundersquish because that comment made me laugh WAY more than it should have! Oh, speaking of scraping data, I don't remember who did it the first time, but could we set up a top 100 commenters for this campaign as well? ;) Well, CB, someone did rename a pet officially, so I don't know if they need our Cub Sub name, but maybe they'll honor it as an honoree? ` Aether, yeah, we had some ideas, I don't even remember them right now, but this just seemed like fate! @Zem, we wouldn't have to host the photos on the website if we could find the permalinks for the photos on Facebook. Same for the haikus. We would need a script like the one for the Playtet parties to scrape the data from Facebook and Twitter. @Aether Tower, before, but we hadn't gotten very far, so we took a shot at the "naming a vessel" goal. If that doesn't work out, we may rename the sub. oooh now I understand why there was a conversation about the 'pirate-bear-flag' a couple of days ago. Did the name of the submarine come up after the stretch goals or before?? oh cool! I didn't know there was a page for the cubsubcorps and I meant omitting the haikus, just the legal pictures; sadly, there are too many pictures lacking the handwritten note with the hashtag We can put some up on the cubsubcorps.com, but there's no way to make a full compilation. Maybe the highlights, but hundreds of pictures and thousands of haikus? I don't think anyone has that kind of time. Someone proposed earlier to collect all the pictures for the achievements in a webpage or the like. Is there's something like that already? We are having a good time seeing the pictures on twitter but an organized webpage compilation for all social media would be handy Not yet CB, haven't had time. I wonder how many read the title of Update # 2 , don't bother to click and read the contents, think something is off and then make their decision. Ghost ist Geist in Deutsch :) And yes, I had to translate a couple words, but I know more than I thought! Which I guess is how I got such a better score than I expected. I missed a troll? Damn work load. Making me miss all the fun. *aber ich verstehe Geist, ich bin in Deutschkurs 101, aber ich verstehe, aber ich verstehe vielen von dem, zum Glück. Und der kaffee ist SEHR wichtig! CB, that's a reference to yesterday, when I finally got a chance to sit down and eat lunch at 8pm. Which, funnily enough... it's 8:43 right now and I just got back with food, so... Well, now I know why I got a 98% in German this morning: to balance for this exam. Whoo boy! ` At least one good thing came of it: I could have made it back to a dining hall in time to eat, but it would have been 4 minutes before closing, so I didn't want to be THAT guy, so I went to get Canes! I needed something to pick me up! Hey, @Dr. P. Have you submitted any entries for the Stretch Goals yet? Lunch??? Zem is in Nebraska. It's after 8PM where he lives. It's OK though. Some other crew member is bound to show up sooner or later. Helps us Zem, you're our only hope! Think Zem is probably recouping from some exams and getting ready to eat lunch. ;) @Zem, we need you again. It's been an hour without a comment. Just got an update from another recent project some here might be familar with - in it ,need to select 5 final color schemes from among 35. Decisions... I'm going to have to go buy a box of Teddy Grahams and take a photo of sharing them with friends. SHARING them is going to be the hard part. I really like Teddy Grahams. ... And they stick really well to baby blankets too. ;-) Yes, was thinking about that. And if it isn't bare skin, but say of a top, what's to stop you from devising a little hack, with a litle support beneath? :P @PC, the thing is that gummy bers will stick to each other if sufficiently moistened, That may be a loophole that makes it easier to get a stack of 10. Kind of hard to detect in a photo. Oh, on that Gummy Bear stacking challenge - Did Elan specifically atate that they need be slef-standing? Just saw one with ten (10) I suspect papa is holding them in place. ;) It has the little sign - c'mon! :P Looking at Twitter and seeing the stream of Haijus starting to roll in. Keep writing, folks - one or two are bound to be subjectively good enough to curry favor..;) <url>ückwunsch zu 99% in deinem Deutsch Examen! Hoffe der Kaffee hilft dir bei deinem nächsten Examen! @PC, how can they say no to a rat that saves lives? I've heard of those rats, and they're amazing! I'm glad someone used this as an excuse to support one! Oh boy, time to go get ready for that exam. Good news: I found out my first exam today, German, was a 98%! Bad news: This is Physical Chemistry, not German. And I haven't been able to focus on anything worth crap all day... coffee to the rescue! <url>"A Hero Rat" - one trained to detect the presence of certaindiseases, in this case TB. "As per Oatmeal's request to spread glorious madness in the name of his new cardgame, I have officially changed the registered name of one of my HeroRats (one of the Tuberculosis detection ones) to CRABBIN' MCTHUNDERSQUASH. CRABBIN' McTHUNDERSQUASH has so far successfully detected one case of TB, although with such infrequent updates from Apopo, I suspect probably more in reality (they can go through hundreds of screenings in a day)" Welcome and goodnight @IC! Nice to have another Brit! ;) Cheers all :-) glad I could give you another excuse to post the link! Right bedtime here in England, night all @CB emailed you :) I posted another movie photo: the baby on the Vegas Strip in "Honey, I Blew Up the Kid" is now a grizzly bear. <url>"Callum "Imploding Cub"it is! Now I get to post the URL again for people who haven't seen it yet. www.cubsubcorps.com @Zem, that's a good fallback idea for the vessel name. One of us! One of us! One of us! One of us! Welcome Callum x @Zem that and look at the current pledge level its practically stalled. I mean we should be at 1.5 million by now Whoa... almost half an hour with no comment in the middle of the evening?! That must be a new record! Yea i hear ya man. A 52 card kitty explosion is pretty messy :-) Thanks @PC, I don't like the mess after an explosion, implosions are so much cleaner Callum, I like it! Welcome aboard! @IC nice I like your cub name. Hope you all enjoy my Yogi baby Also decided to give myself a cub name (Mike, would you be able to update me on the site please) If he doesn't accept the Cub Sub name as the Crabbin' McThundersquash one, we'll have to name the vessel the Crawfish McThundersquish for sure! Crawfish McThundersquish! That made me laugh a heck of alot more than it should have! @CB: Get an embroidered collar that says it...might need to branch out still and have some of it on a tag. Did you notice the title of Update 2 was, "Stop Giving Us Money?" I wonder if that was an answer to one or more comments that have appeared. @GM, LOL. It would be hard to fit all of that onto a tiny tag for a dog that weighs less than six pounds though. It's be more like, "Crawfish McThundersquish." For those of you who disagree with the philosophy of a campaign that's already overfunded pursuing social goals rather than monetary ones, I need only remind you of Exploding Kittens, also by Elan Lee et. al. That campaign had us meeting social goals all the way to the end and ended up being the Most Backed campaign of all time. It's also currently the 6th Most Funded campaign of all time. Seems like a good idea to me. Also, it delivered the rewards On Time. If I had a baby, it would totally be getting renamed for this week. In fact, if I could have pets, I'd get a kitten and name it that right now! @CB, Nice. :) @CB: You should go in and say "So, what do you think of the name Crabbin' McThundersquash? Since I was thinking Cappuccino is a little too common." LOL. My vet's already complaining about the name Cappuccino having too many letters. Can you imagine his reaction if I told him that I renamed hom "Crabbin' McThundersquash?" OK, I put the name on the CubSub for now. The ball's in Cap'n Lee's court. Still, I'm hoping for a pet or an Actual Physical Vessel. We can always re-cristen it if there is an objection. Ooh, I like that Yellow Sub model idea! We need that and a labelmaker! because of the massive number of submissions that will be using the same hash tag it would give the rescue pet significantly more media exposure than it would otherwise normally receive and so it would be a win win for everyone involved. Another option is that if anyone works at a place that has rescued pets for adoption they could name a pet as "Crabbin' McThundersquash" with a certificate and then use it as away to promote the adoption of that pet. Who ever adopts the pet could then keep the name or change it to what ever they want. What about getting a Model Yellow Submarine like this one linked below and then create a decal of "Crabbin' McThundersquash" that could then be applied to the model yellow submarine. <url>#bearsvsbabies Be sure, if it's a photo submission, to have a note with #BearsvsBabies . #bearsvsbabies , etc, clearly visible in-frame. Are the stretch goals individual or a group effort ? @BruceP... I like the pet name tag one! @Zem...birthed of a squall of champagne :) Good luck & wits on your exam!!! Cha!, why a mini champagne bottle? Just start the video pointing at a tiny model yellow submarine, and then crash a full bottle of champagne into it! Hmm have a model of a yellow submarine and shoot a video of smashing a mini champagne bottle on it proclaiming it named Crabbin' McThundersquash and create a ship registry entry with the name and owners are SubCubCorps :) We'll see. I'm sure they'll clarify it one way or another. That really is going with the feel over all. You could probably even paint a small toy and get the props.... I'm no good at that kind of a thing though. They might except a joke. Like a ship with a plank on the side showing the name for as something else for but a moment. @CB, Here's something really rough. Feel free to tweak it: <url>"Crabbin' McThundersquash," but I think it has to be an actual physical vessel. Anyone have a spare submarine? A boat, air balloon, submarine named Crabbin' McThundersquash Hmmm the legal part... How do you legally name a pet? @DrP, I'm least looking forward to the haikus. Glad I don't have to read all 1,000 of them. Something fun for everyone though. Glad someone likes them. Well it does say baby, pet or vessel The legal name change one is going to be the hardest to complete..... are there any volunteers? Haiku in plural Is same as in Haiku in singular :) The only downside to getting the stretch goal details today....we were looking after my nephew on Saturday, so I could have done at least one then. :P I'm most looking forward to the haikus.... @CB: Still makes my hand itch. But I guess it's the way my mind words with numbers relating to cycles, and what not. Percentages are good for less than the whole(same thing with months) @GM, baby clothes don't stop at 12 months. There is an 18 month size, so it's generally considered acceptable to give a baby's age in months up to 24. I've started a Stretch Goals page on www.cubsubcorps.com to keep track of achievements and offer suggestions like last time. If you know of a rule that should be added or have verifiable information onupdated totals, please let me know. Ani* Not sure if Anu counts as a baby in the Phantom Menace poster. :) Nosferato That poster from The Phantom Menace, with little Ani casting a shadow of Vader. Instead have a bear... or the Nosfetato vampire shadow... A Carrie bear on prom stage getting dumped on with blood A Freddy bear shadow? I'm sure there's plenty of possibilities in all the cult horror movies. A bear silhouette in the shower scene? Wish I had the skillz Thanks. I'll post it to twitter or Facebook. :) Very cool @BruceP! Bear replacing a baby in a movie scene? <url># Abba 'Take A Chance On Me' <url># Abba 'Gimme Gimme Gimme' <url>"hoops". "Already earned." quit acting spoiled, they aren't even obligated to provide them. Paul, just a quick question to explain everything, were you around for the Exploding Kittens campaign? if so, then you already should understand why. @Paul: You can leave it, or take it. 100% up to creators how, and if, they give stretch goals. Oh ppffftt! It's fine, and will be fun. Oh God! Not this crap again. Media based stretch goals in "Family Plot" was fun and innovative. In a project that has already raised $1.4 Million, it's ridiculous to the point of stupidity. If you all want to jump through a bunch of social media hoops to get stretch goals we should have already earned, be my guest. I ain't interested. @PC: And my hand itches to smack people who refer to a kid that is over a year old in months. I just personally find it annoyingly stupid. I'm with @Dr.P..if it looks like a baby it is a baby ;) @Zem...developmentally viewed you're not even a 'man' yet as you're under 25 but sure I'm looking forward to your man baby pictures balancing 5, 7 and as many as you can get stacked gummy bears on your tummy Let's make a bet of how many you can do :) Hey guys, this looks like it's going to be a fun game! I'm glad it's been funded. But one thing that you might try doing to promote it is to send an email to all the Exploding Kittens backers. I did not receive such an email, and only learned about the project from Facebook. And I haven't seen a lot about it on Facebook, like I did with Exploding Kittens. Just FYI. Young children often have their ages listed in months from a developmental poibt of view, because so much happens over their early months. I've known some adults to do that for fun - 780 months, etc. ;) 1 year is really the cut off from baby to toddler. 2 is possible, but pushing it. Honestly though, if they looks like a baby it's probably whatever. @PC: You mean 2 and a half? Yeah, what about me? What about man babies? Maybe 30 months is a good compromise? :P Errr, I meant 2 ^=^ Under 3 years old seems like a reasonable cut-off for baby/toddler. There is enough variance, it can be hard to tell. Do we have someone on the twitters making sure people know about the the #hashtag note? Made myself a big ol' diaper baby, now to design a pumpkin! @Anja is right the picture will need to have a post it note with #BearsVsBabies in the picture to prove that you didn't just google search for an existing picture I would say up to 1 year old is baby, then it becomes a toddler. Cat photo done, bear haiku done, what's next So far, I have posted a Lego Bear and a Fighter Jet Cat. Looking at the other submissions, MOST of them are missing the physical hashtag #BEARSVSBABIES in the photo. PLEASE include the hashtag in you photos written on a card or something, not just photoshopped in later so that your submission will count toward reaching that goal. Please do not forget to showcase a note or such with #BearsvsBabies in your photo submissions!!! what's the cutoff for "baby" age? If my SIL hadn't already decided he's going as a lion...then I would do my best to convince her to dress him as a bear. And disguised as a bear! Stack gummy bears on the sleeping baby dressed as a tank! I love the recent update! How creative :]]] Best part about being an uncle...you can usually get away with weird things like stacking gummy bears, or building a tank costume for the kid. I was talking to my wife the other day and because I have roughly what equates to maybe an early-Iron Age understanding of technology, called Instagram "The Pinstagram...thing" at which point she began laughing at me. I'm imagining a facechatsnapgram as some sort of telegram with a picture of you on it! Now I just need to figure out this Facechatsnapgram thing... @PC she posts the kid's picture on there ALL the time. I don't think that would be an objection. That's what the kids do these days right? All day on the Tweetsy? Haha, blur out the baby's face! I did the tweetsie thing!!!! So... you ever try stacking gummy bears on you baby while it's sleeping? Wanna try? The only reason i could see that she would object is if she doesn't want her babies pictures posted on the internet. Hey, will, even if they don't, does anybody in your house like gummy bears? Because, uh, I need to stack some on the kidlet, and if they fall off, the cats can eat them, right? @Karhu it would probably work best if you show her the stretch goal update first and then ask Karhu, Hey, yeah, um... I'm just gonna get to the point. Does your kid like gummy bears? I just posted a bear themed haiku on Twitter! I need to see if my SIL will let us stack some gummy bears on her youngest kid. I have no idea how to broach THAT question. I hope they do launch parties again like they did with the previous campaign. @Kim I would guess that they will be available as early as a couple of weeks after the kick starter shipment is fulfilled. This is not their first campaign so they will likely order an additional 20 to 30% above what is needed for the campaign. HA, of course they'd do the same thing as before! It was so awesome and fun! Kim, last time it was available just as they delivered, for many reasons. So I'd say this will be commercially available right around the time the game ships or just a bit later. Update uploaded? That'll bring all the boys to the yard here. You can't complain about comments slowing down because they're about to FREAKING FLOOD over the next few hours! Good plan @Josh! Well now we need a Stretch page for our website to document all of the submissions :-) Quick question. Does anyone know how long after the game is shipped to the backers that it will be available for the public to buy? Sitting back making popcorn and waiting for the hashtags to start flowing. Nice to see the stretch goals are just as fun as EK's were The Stretch Song <url>"early next week", it's typically the Monday. 2:07 AM. For you people of Earth. Heyas! Think we'll get an update today or tommorrow.? I kind of expect one at an unorthadox time, well for the time-zone they're in - like @:07 AM. :P The hot sauce cheesecake wouldn't take off. Hell, it took FOREVER to try and get people to try blue cheese crème Brule....and it was actually quite decent. *Brittle, Cheesecake. I just like bacon too much. The continuation of the Hot Sauce Maple Bacon Bourbon Brittle empire, Hot Sauce Maple Bacon Bourbon Cheesecake. Bacon, Cheesecake... we could have one for the entire alphabet! Maple-bacon cheesecake, perhaps? Good morning, BaKhan! Morning cub sub! Some of the other currently funding card / board games look like a good smattering of fun, too. Hmmm. Kevin, or that time we hit $1.5 million? Seems like only hours from now! (hopefully) Remember those sweet innocent times of Yesteryear, when we had only 38,600 backers. Seems like just moments ago. *tear* I'm sure it's been tried. Guys we need a story mode! @GM, Soeaking of healthy, I hope no one ever comes out with kale cheesecake. @CB: It is expensive, but oh so good. My cousin made some pumpkin swirl cheesecake for our Thanksgiving, and it was amazing. I restricted myself to just one piece since I am trying(emphasis on trying) to eat healthier. A friend of mine was talking about getting a cheap slice of cheesecake last Friday, so I suggested that it would be better to just get a slice at the Cheesecake Factory. He said that they were too expensive. Yesterday, I found myself near the Cheesecake Factory and discovered that he was right about the price, but I bought a slice anyway. It was worth every penny. Mmmm ... butter tarts .... Those sound so good GC! (CHOP *NOMNOMNOM*) @GC: I will be making butter tarts this week for Saturday night. @Dr.P: I'm a casual too, but I go for all the clears I can...I haven't done any of the savage raids...though there are items in there that I definitely want. I main a Dragoon on XIV, with a Black Mage or Paladin as my secondary(not sure which one will be my secondary to be honest). I was busy making lemon drizzle cakes for work *Throws at screen for fellow cubbies* I kind of go back and forth between FFXIV and WoW. I'm not super big into MMORPGs, I'm a casual. Most of what I did was play FFXIV. Finally got a clear on one of the most annoyingly fun trials in the game to date. Sophia(Extreme). She tilts the arena from side to side every now and then, causing you to slide all over the place. Potentially falling off to your instant death. If you look up the fight on YouTube, you can see everything that goes on in it(I think the videos are ~5-10min long, and explain the fight in depth). Now...there is only one of the extreme trials I have yet to finish, that being Nidhogg Extreme...then I need to farm them for some of the drops that everyone gets to roll on(1-99 is what you can roll, and only 1 weapon, 1 song scroll, and potentially one mount whistle drops per clear). I bought a bunch of Legos to give away for Christmas. I did laundry and played Dragon Quest, with some WoW and yubtube watching splashed in here and there to spice things up. I'm liking Legion so far. @CB: Morning. And nope, I didn't go away. Not going away for a while now. Morning cubbies. Comments have really slowed down. Did everyone go away for the eekend? @Tom Karbowski, Cubs or White Sox? $1.4M and still no stretch goals?!?!? I'd really like to see the NSFW booster become it's own complete deck, like with Exploding Kittens. And has anyone checked out the first expansion to Exploding Kittens, "Imploding Kittens". Oddly only available on Amazon, the box for it is HUGE! DO NOT MISS THE "CONE OF SHAME"! Any Chicago natives here? Mornin' GM! Morning cubs! @Dr.P... hope your day looks up and you will feel unclubbed! :) Yes it is.... a rough start for me though. I also feel fantastic, except for that weird feeling liked i've been clubbed as well. ( no, I have not been clubbed ) @Zem...good luck & wits on your 2 exams today! @Dr. P... Good Morning! It's a beautiful day! That can be viewed in the "manage your pledge" tab. A big blue button that can be seen somewhere above the [leave a comment] box. On the right. Whoever asked about multiple decks: $35 or more Core Deck + NSFW Booster Pack One copy of Bears vs Babies (Ages 7+) AND One copy the NSFW Booster Pack (Ages 35+) + All Core Deck stretch goals + All Booster Pack stretch goals + Free shipping in the U.S. -If you'd like more than 1 deck, just add $35 for each extra deck you'd like. (we'll figure out any extra shipping charges when we send you the survey after the campaign.) So many impatient people with this campaign! I can't wait for the next update just to satisfy them. The only real question - and stretch goal - is: can we beat the approx 8.7Mio Dollars of Exploding Kittens with this one ;) Yey @GC! We got ours over the weekend. You will love it x So.....when we getting stretch goals people?? :) Yay! Imploding kittens is coming today :D @Aussie Jess if you look at the 2 tiers it states how much you must add for extra games. I.E. "-If you'd like more than 1 deck, just add $25 for each extra deck you'd like. (we'll figure out any extra shipping charges when we send you the survey after the campaign.)" Woot woot! Hope this gets some awesome stretch goals like exploding kittens Hey Elan, If we want more than 1 deck, how should we proceed? I'd like 2 or 3 I'm going to go to bed early, at 10, to get some extra sleep before 2 exams tomorrow! Oh hey, roommate, you need to see this! And this! 2 hours later ... and that's why you should never google Bible Black. (I warned you) *other roommate talks* [conversation about high school lunch table topics, such as our favorite historical tortures] *final roommate returns, talks* *hijinks* Oh look............ it's midnight. Surprise surprise. Why can I never just SLEEP?!?!?! Emily Browning 'Sweet Dreams' <url># And One 'TimeKiller (Project Pitchfork Cover)' <url># Wolfsheim "Find You're Here" & "Find You're Gone" <url># Informatik 'A Matter Of Time' <url># Apoptygma Berzerk 'Until The End Of The World (Dark Club Remix)' <url># Vast 'One More Day' <url># A few past midnight tunes Neuroticfish 'A Greater Good' <url># But we'll want them. Remember that the NSFW deck was just an expansion, before it was added to, growing to its own stand-alone entity unto itself. ->>Imploding Kittens, delivery scheduled for tommorrow. :D Maybe I'll play a round with the fam in anticipoation. ;) IU remember their was some anxiousness, then, because they hadn't really anticipated the huge success of the last campaign and had to think quickly on their feet and brain-storm ideas. Eventually, it wound being basicly the same bsic concept, but with a few niceities thrown in - the presentation. Any stretch-goals would probably follow similar lines, this time. They swon't effect basic game-play, but will add a little flair and fun, and if not achieved it won't be a grievous loss, but some fun in the attempt, anyways. Yeah, it'd be cool if they could somehow hire someone to work officially in-chat (*ahem* someone here all day every day anyways, who loves answering questions and having a good time *ahem*), but they were really good with updates, both making them and keeping us informed and questions answered, and kept up with stuff on social media really well. ` Hmmm... you guys think they would pay me to comment? I never even thought about that before! Give me an official account to come in and answer and keep informed... For the low, low price of $30/comment! Act fast! Elan didn't chat too often, but when he did do updates, he liked to work in a narrative related to the game. He usually would inckude art-work. He chimed in a day or so ago, in the comments that, yes, stretch-goals are coming. Probably similar to last time, we'll get a chart of things to do, that when accomplished, will unlock a little something extra. I'm not sure I understand that question, Rye. Communication different from... the creators? How/who? I mean, it'll probably be broken mid- to late-tomorrow, but we could theoretically break it tonight! Those that were on EK KS, how was the communication from the creators? Oooh, come on 1.5 million!!! We can break this tonight! Cha!, I eat plenty, just not regularly. Though the funny thing is most people point to irregular sleep schedules, when mine is actually so regular it's annoying to me! ;) Did we kit $1.5 million already? @Zem... you should really nourish your developing self more often! @tom. Because the have 1.5 MILLION dollars without doing anything... better watch my comment.. may be called a troll for stating the obvious. Tom, they're just letting previous and loyal backers come back so far, I think. They have checked in a few times already, and if you were around for Exploding Kittens, you know they're one of the best teams at communication, actually! Don't worry, starting "early [this] week", they'll start ramping it up, and be checking in here and in updates more frequently. @Tom... it's the quiet before the storm or all out war between bears and babies :) Cha!, if I had it my way, I would be living about 32 hour days on average, so I'd eat 5 or 6 times whenever I felt like it, so I guess it's nice that I'm limited to 8pm lunches! ;) @Zem...Isn't 4ish High Tea time? And you called 8pm lunch time...that fits with Uni time :) Really bad communication from @creators. Why is there no check ins or updates Oh gosh, I hope it's not that bad! Today was a bit weird schedule-wise, but normally, you know, breakfast at about 8, lunch at 2:00, and supper at 4:30-ish. Like a normal person, right? @Zem... you are so on Uni time @Pub Cup.. it is good to go out from time to time and interact with people, touch and smell the teas :) Well, finally time to eat lunch. It's 8 pm. Lunchtime! A bit slow today. Maybe the new week will bring warmth to the cheeks and spark to the eyes of passer-bys. Whose up for a good challenge? *book-marks * for reference. :) I usually go to a local tea and coffee shop, located down-town, but this time of year supplies get a bit picked over, partly due to cooler weather and people wanting to curl up with a warm cuppa. :) They have a National Nut Day Sale :) I really like Adagio Teas www.adagio.com Next time, I might do a little more research against stocks, rather than wing it. At your service! *bow* Supplies were a bit lacking, so I just opted for some Earl Grey, as I was in a bit of a rush. @Pub Cup... Slayer of irelevent run on sentences ;) What tea did you end up with? Their mass introduction resulted in the production of more Fairy Cake than (some other Hitch-Hikers Guide reference I'll have to research or make up as I am this silly bit of prattle) , most of an inferior quality and using a disproportionate amount of resources, almost equaling in some of the more unfashionable parts, parts almost equal to what the matrix was supposed to algothmically represent (or something) , so many of the galactic confectionary unions and tourist boards (from affected regions) (insert crated names here) , wouldn't put up with that sort of thing. OK, I better stop... Well, with the advent of miniaturation and shoddy manufacturing processes and lowered safety regulations , they eventually were able to create versions that were able to fit ones pocket. These were taken to parties, often of people the individual didn't like and sprung on unsuspecting pat guests, until they were effectively banned in most parts of the galaxy. You can still find pne occassionaly in some second-hand stores, mixed among the blenders and various other consumable paraphenalia. Wait, are you saying I'm the custodian? ... But I like my body! His body was so annoying, only interested in physical, worldly pleasures... I hope he found a nice new body that respected him. ;) @PJ - My husband backed EK and we just got the expansion from Amazon delivered today :]] who else backed exploding kittens and bought the expansion XD *Sips his tea* Snilty : Infinity -1 Kevin: Zilch. But that is OK :) Ack, I meant Zem, Anja is pretty neat too, but Zem is more likely to understand the reference Meaning, I just screwed up. Tah-dah! (Getting older sucks) ;) <url>` And the NSFW add-on isn't marketable? Go look at the campaign page and see the ratio of NSFW+BvB combo tier backers and just regular BvB backers. And yes, the Amazon.com EK Core and NSFW are currently or for a possibly limited time available at 20% off. They did spend a million bucks on the EK Kickstarter exclusive box. I don't believe that'll be available again. @Pub Cub Go for it... :) @Anja -"... but that's not all...for a limited time.." NO, there is no Bears vs Babies and Exploding Kittens combo tier But you are in unbearable luck as you can get Exploding Kittens Right Now by ordering it on Amazon USA*! Why wait for a reward tier, the end of a campaign for a different game and months of fulfillment if Exploding Kittens could be assuredly yours right now! Here's what you get: -Exploding Kittens is THE card game for people who are into kittens and explosions and laser beams and sometimes goats. -Family-friendly, party game for 2-5 players (up to 9 players when combined with any other deck). -This is the most-backed project in Kickstarter history and all cards feature illustrations by The Oatmeal. -Includes 56 cards (2.5 x 3.5 inches), box, and instructions. -This box, like 99.99% of boxes, does not meow. ALL this for one equal payment of only $19.99! Online Ordering Operators Are Standing By! But only if you Act Now! Don't think, it's a great and much more timely deal! It could be in your paws within 48hrs! Buy Now! **Offer Void In Bearania. But wait, there's more! If you order right now we will add the Exploding Kittens NSFW version for just $19.99!

Now! *All this EK goodness is also available to our European customers on Amazon U.K. and Amazon Germany **As if Bears would play Exploding Kittens ...everyone knows they just play with Babies The extras were nice, but it's easy to understand how impractical some of it was from a mass-market angle, especially the NSFW add-on, since people associate games with kids. They couldn't place this in a mainstream toystore chain. E(e)K Infomercial Alert There's a reason it was called "Kickstarter-exclusive". ^Tease, even. *tease* *tease* They probably want the version of Exploding Kittens as revealed and showcased on the original EK KickStarter, having missed out on all of the goodies - the extra cards, the box, with the "Surpise" inside. I'm not sure, but is the NSFW deck that was a big draw, even available for sale outside of the original campaign? They;ll just have to decide whether they'll jump onto the crazy-train, now or possibly miss out on goodies, again. *tesae* ;) Why do so many people want the EK-BvB combo tier? Just get EK on amazon! Things could change though. One thing about the Exploding Kittens campaign was its unpedictabilty and this looks like it might evolve in the same way. Something is cooking up for next week, with a few surprises! I think they've decided against offering that as an add-on at this time. The original Kick Starter version, with the extra incentives, is long gone, now and only the standard edition is left, The standard version is available on Amazon for around $20 US. :) I would like to have the possibility to buy also Exploding Kittens together with this game Mornin' It's fine. I haven't taken any pain meds for a few days now, so that's good. Morning LZ. How is the noggin? Good morning cubbies! Me and my family have just had our first game of exploring kittens with the new expansion in it ( imploding kittens ) Sorry for the repeat message... Internet issues... Sorry I missed out on the late night tunes, but here's one in honor of my Indians (also in the World Series / also a loooonnnngggg time since we won). <url>` 13 in a row are Cha!. Wow, and here I thought I was the Chief of Spam! Good job, Cha!! Woo. Finally got to play Imploding Kittens! It was amazing! Just like the playtest deck, but nicer! ` I didn't warn them of when the cone of shame is used, so when my little brother inevitably asked, ridicule followed for the entire game, and it was hilarious! God, that was the best idea ever! I love this game so much, and so can't wait for BvB! Sweet dreams of BvB challenges Fleetwood Mac "Dreams" <url># Lukas Graham "7 Years" <url>"7 Years" Yep, stretch goals & challenges early next week! Florence + The Machine "Dog Days Are Over" <url>"Glory And Gore <url>"Riverside" <url># Hum.... maybe I'm a bit sleepy, let's try this again Ben Howard "In Dreams" <url># Most of you are right now... Ben Howard "In Dreams" Really liking this twisty song Calum Scott "Dancing On My Own" <url>"Devil Like Me" <url>"Plunder" <url>"The Arsonist's Lullaby <url>#FlyTheW You never can tell, though. People were saying the same thing about DVD vs LaserDisc. The past is imperfect at best in predicting the future. Besides, chicklet memory could have other uses than just storing UHD moviesa. Clayton, THERE'S A NEW SHOW OF THAT?! Dang it to heck, I haven't even read the books yet! I need to order them, binge them, and then binge the show! Well, I think things like UHD, at least for the short-term, like LD was before, are more of an afficinado format, that aren't likely going to reach wide-spread use, at least for quite awhile. Most people are pretty satisfied with the quality of DVD and it still has a 65% share over Blu-Rays 30% ish share. Some of it is cost sensitivity, not wanting to rebuy what is "good-enough" already. So, I figure if it's destined to be a niche product, anyways, why not amp up the quality of the packaging and the dis, itself? Heh, I just miss the art-work and liner notes my aging eyes can read, mainly. Ooh, you know what would be cool? A contactless ultra-high capacity storage medium, sort of like a super NFC chip that you could just drop into the player and watch the movie! I recorded the new dirks gentry holistic detective show on BBC America. ^Very true. ^><^ Yeah, but people like things getting smaller while capacity increases, so I don't know how well a 7" disc would be accepted by the public. Still too expensive, though I guess if you developed something that could only be written to once... They did try having set-top players to play back DVD -quality movies. Didn't kick off well. Unfortunate, because you might be able to get those on a card costing just a couple of dollars to produce, given modern compression techniques. Oh, well. Actually, it would be cool if they would come up with a non-rotating medium that doubled the capacity of a Blu-Ray, like a trans flash memory chip. ^You need a new player anyway and most players have the 3" inch, along with the 5" wll, why not have one size up. :P Hopefully if they get this 4K situation sorted, the next generation should have a treat instore. Actually, it would have been nice if they had made a compromise with Ultra Hi-Def and scaled up the media to something likje a 7" sisc. (Same as an old 45) That way, one could have better art-work and more than twice the data storage available on disc..and...and... Oh, well. :) I've been on and off. Yes, it wasn't as appealing during the DVD transition, as the quality of the video was better, the reduced siaze of the artwork from LD seemed like a step back. Since they've started putting out Blu-rays, I've started up again. Mostly waiting for sales, admittedly. ;) Criterion is sweet. I haven't ordered from then since they were making LaserDiscs. :::Mutley curses::: But it was some Criterion discs I ordered during their 50% off sale. :3 Yeah! ...but it wasn't that. Actually, something was just dropped off. : @Zem, I wasn't creative enough to design my own card, but I still have the playtest deck, so if I ever come up with something, I can still use that blank card. Heehee, I still have my playtest deck for IK, so I could really have just used that. Plus, then I get to use my cards I made, Sneak Attack. They paired so well with the backwards kitten because you could then force the next player to do nothing but draw the top card unless they had the other Sneak Attack card. I was rather proud of the art as well: a cat version of Kilroy was Here and Admiral Catbar saying, "It's a trap!" Still haven't gotten my IK set, probably by Monday / Tuesday. *crosses toes* Imploding Kittens is the new Exploding Kittens. That Imploding Kitten card definitely ramps up the tension when it appears face-up. ^released later this year. Maybe some reduced-priced sets coming, soon. Naw, probably not. Saw that BBC America and the ole Beeb had teamed and pooled resources into animating one of the old Dalek stories. Probably be the last classic series release, unless someone funds more reconstructions or animations of classic /lost/wiped episodes. I liked the books and the serial better than the movie for Hitchhiker's. Used to watch a good deal of 'Who' , years ago. Still need to collect some of the series, but was holding off until the individual releases were over with and they'd group them into box-sets. Still prefer physical media over stream or more heavily compressed downloadable files. Haven't read THGTTG in quite awhile. Probably should give it another whirl. I watched The Pirate Planet years ago with my bestest buddy. Good Times. I just re-re-reread the entire Hitchhiker's series the end of this summer finishing a little under a month ago. Best decision I made all year! Goodness, what horrid grammar. Think it was the during the Tom Baker era - Tall, dark har, long scarf. The one that pops to time is 'The Pirate Planet' , part of the "Key to Time' season. Ooh, Kevin, I loved the tv series of Hitchhiker's Guide! It was just like the old, cheap Dr. Who episodes! Which is funny because Douglas Adams wrote a few Dr. Who episodes. I still need to watch those! Finally going to get to play Imploding! My little brother is stopping by my parents' house and picking it up, and I'll play with him, one roommate, and possibly his friend and another roommate. Imploding Kittens just came. Woo! Like this bad pun.: <url>"wah" sound are something that have been around as features for awhile, in dolls, even in some of the early Steiff Bears. And since they make their sounds by physical means, there are no batteries to wear out, though the mechanism will eventually go. Would need an ambitous stretch to get something like that, though. Seriously, as fussy and wnty as we all are, Elan should package this set in a diaper pail. ;) I WANT A SPECIAL BOX THAT GROWLS LIKE A BEAR WHEN I OPEN IT! I don't think the EK team would put it out if they didn't think it was. Seems like it will be pretty entertaining. There are still ways to target certain players, which is what made EK fun. do you think this game will be as fun as exploding kittens? OH come ON! I'm not even on a phone. Actual computer... Ciiiiii ^After getting many complaints sent into the Complaints Department. <url>"If you need us." , we'll be around doing what we do best, when we're doing nothing. @Cha! you're making me cry tears of joy, even though it's someone else you're trying to help. @Zem... good one! Life is quite absurd so... <url># It's a 42 kind of day Let them distract me from 42? Okay! Well, while you're here, let some adorable bears and babies distract you from life, the universe, and everything! Yes LZ. Each day can only be taken one at a time, just hope it gets better as you move forward man. LZ! No matter, it's good to hear from you again! One day at a time @LZ - big hugs to you, my friend! Yeah, me too. I'm trying to stay positive, but failed miserably yesterday. I'm hoping I can do better at keeping it together today. Hope everything works out for you @LZ x Thanks, Dr P! I hope so, too. Have you seen the news I'm talking about? I posted it on the EK page. hey LZ, hope things get better for ya Hi, everybody! Sorry to have been gone the last couple days. I needed to take some time to process some terrible news. I might be gone again in the future, but I'm here now. 'Sup, errbody? @Filipe: "Why don't you ship to my country? When we shipped out Exploding Kittens, we learned a lot about which regions were too problematic to ship card games. We've excluded those regions this time around. If you've found that we don't ship to your country, please write us at <email> and we'll do our best to find a solution." That's all further down on the campaign page. You can always use that email to see what's up! I think they might stay away from doing things that include EK with this KS. But I'm definitely hoping for a full NSFW deck too!!! Does anyone have any news why can't it be shipped to Brazil? I backed EK and shipping here was just fine. You guys HAVE to ship here! =[ Common full NSFW expansion for the stretch goal! Or maybe a party pack box that'll hold all the bvb and kitten cards @eva - We were a part of the EK campaign and didn't get charged import tax/customs charges. I am in the U.K. Hope that helps x @Zem, they said there would be stretch goals "early next week," not necessarily on Monday. Good morning, cubbies. Please keep checking www.cubsubcorps.com to stay current on everything we're doing, and send me your crew assignments if you want to be on the crew. This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. @Wim Moes. Yes it is $10 to my country also, but my question is if the games will be shipped from within the EU. Otherwise we get a hefty import tax and import fees on top of the shipping charge. Shipping to the Netherlands is $10, so I think the rest of the EU will almost be the same. Since it is sort of impossible to look through 2479 comments I might ask what is already asked. But will there be EU-friendly shipping? (Please please say yes so I can buy the NSFW deck also) Good morning cubs! Don't know if they will go that far as to create enough new art-work to create a whole new NSFW pack, like they did last time, but it would be nice. Maybe as a stretch-goal, like last time. @Flo1983 Try contacting them directly, either by clicking the "Contact" button to your upper-right, under where it says how much you've pledged or emailing them at: <email> Nsfw is only a booster pack. Make a whole nsfw box like kittens was Countries sorry Where.do.i.find the list of.counries you are.shipping to? ^If we could talk Elvira or one of the other "B" movie hosts into doing some cross-promtotion for Halloween week, we could have a cemetary commentary. OK, probably not, but had to say it. Anyways, should be a fun week ahead. Even as I'm speculating what I might do and what I might expect, I must be mindful to seperate out that from our other discussions, elsewhere. It';s a little strange, as things do follow a natural course. Hopefully I won't make myself too tongue-tied. :) Kevin, those were my exact thoughts. I think they have some different stages planned for this that will kick in when they noticed last time it plateaued. This time, they knew to get through all of us loyal backers coming back for more, and on week 2, kick things off, then get into a swing of things, and make the last week one big party/final push. Though, I mean, they were pros at this thing last time when they TOTALLY weren't expecting what they got. This time they've had time to plan, so it should turn out perfect. ^Don't worry, I find my typos, grammatical mistakes, annoying as well. ;) There was a certain built-0in audience fr this game that would jump in early. Now it's time to start reaching out to more causal fans or those who haven't heard about Elan or the Oatmeal, etc. This is a fairly normal drop-off for a campaign, after the first few days. Next week, we'll be ready to do our first promtional push. I think it's probably better that the campaign waited until a week in to let things settle, before making a big social media push. Staves off the eventual burn-out. By the looks of it, things are really slowing down. Those stretch goals he said he'll announce monday should hopefully come at exactly the right time to kick things back into gear! I wonder if they have this thing planned in stages so it doesn't stagnate too long at any one point during the campaign? What happened to Phil, GM's friend? He was on from day one, and then fell off the map, but he was the chosen one to cover the night shift. That's right, this is supposed to be a commentary, not a cemetary. ;) Hopefully, next week brings a little more animation, again. Settling down for the night, but checking in to see what the usual suspects are up to. It worked! I summoned a comment! Hope everyone had a lovely night. GA-bu-wuh?! 2 hours?! NOOOO!!! ` Ah well, I need to sleep now. Yo, Europeans? You got it from here? Comment at least once tonight/morning! LOL, @Zem, but so true! Back when we were living in the midwest, my wife and I got to go to New Ulm, Minnesota for Oktoberfest. Good times that. Polka is the sounds made when a bunch of people with accordions get drunk. It's fun music! @Zem... you're doing just fine It has drinking as part of the playlist title. Polka and drinking go together Uhm they all kinda sound the same to me. Enjoy! :) Wow, this is a good playlist! Liechtensteiner is next! The first one on your list has the same tune as "Beer Barrel Polka" but the lyrics are in German. Love it! Jeez! I need some form of alarm system, 6 in 4 minutes! It's Derp and Zem! ;) That's the trouble when you go without a playlist Nooo, no Xmas music yet Alexa is playing, "Santa Claus is Coming to Town," but it IS by Lawrence Welk. @CB... of course she does @Zem... you must have a super duper alert system going @CB... Here's 50+ German Polka songs for you <url>"Alexa, play Bubbles In The Wine and I get Lawrence Welk." I say, "Alexa, play I-Heart Radio" and it plays the last station I was listening to. @CB... how does that work for you? You just tell it what you want? Did anyone hear about the DDoS attack today? Must not have affected KickStarter. I'm glad I have Amazon Echo. I'm still here, just not constantly because nobody else is. Yeah, it died here awhile ago, but before that it was a blur! Oh sure, I show up and everybody leaves, even Zem! Guess I'll have to be my own DJ. I'm away for a movie, then I come back and 97 comments! Thar blue song is weird. Wonder where the heck it came from. Didn't listen to the others. Hard to listen to one song after another when you're trying to get through 97 comments! btw I love coffee, but I didn't start drinking it until I was in my 40's. I have no problem with milk. I'm primarily of Polish/German descent. Finally home! So tired. Too many hours at work. Gonna finish this bottle of Mike's Hard Lemonade and then snooze. Will be sending all Saturday packing for my journey to the land of maple syrup and bacon brittle plus more cleaning and organizing. Wish more of you could make it to the Kitten Con. Like they proved with Exploding Kittens, you don't need a bunch of stretch goals or other pandering to raise a boatload of money here. Frankly, I was on board when I saw the pictures. Hmm... last time it was this quiet for this long, a conversation spontaneously erupted. I must be on my guard! That's really interesting, Kevin! I had no idea! And it makes sense because I'm for the most part 1/2 German and 1/2 all over the UK, and am still young (20) and have always drank a ton of milk, so I would never notice it at all. YAY FOR ME! I can have all the milk I want ever! In fact, this reminded me I have half a gallon in the fridge that needs to be taught the digestive process... ^Oops, my daughter is here. I'm off! *whoosh* Most people, lose some capacity to metabolise lactate after they leave early child-hood, to one degre or other. If you're not consuming a large quantity of it, you might not recognize any proble, because the effects are usually fairly marginal -some loose stools, etc. Of the worlds populations, the Anglo_Germanic groups have devloped the most tolerance, 90% or more, but other groups, like Asian, Hispanic, African-Americans, much of India (yes, they have a great deal of dairy production), have pretty high percentages that don't metabolise it well. Overall, I think they just margin out the groups that have built more of a tolerance. Just something I like to throw out there, that makes people question. ;) Well, Cha!, it seems the rest of your day is set! And dang, you beat me to the helping a commenter out! Cha!, that could make a difference. I was drinking as unprocessed milk as we could find, and even raw milk straight from a farm when a dairy farm started outside of town. No additives nor processing, aside from the legal minimum to kill the bacteria naturally in it so it lasts more than a couple hours. ...and just found The Librarians Season 2, episode 1 on Hulu. :) Mmmh ice cream... just made myself a nice bowl full of Penn State Creamery goodness. With whipped cream and crushed brownie brittle on top :) @Paul... Elan popped in earlier today and announced the following: Elan Lee 2-time Creator Superbacker about 7 hours ago Hi guys! First of all....THANK YOU!!! We're all walking around in a daze at the office at the incredible number of people that showed up to support us! You guys are the bestest! We're building the next big update that will include stretch goals, achievements and the beginning of a month long party. Early next week! Stay tuned! @Zem... it may have something to do with how processed milk and foods are including all the additives that are being added So when are we going to see some stretch goals? At $1.3M, I expected to see something by this point. Like most people? Most people are lack toast in toddler ant? I mean, I know FULL well I'm the exception: in high school, at my peak, I drank in pure milk more than what the countries with the highest per-capity dairy consumption did with ALL dairy products (Finland, #1, averages around 95 gallons), but I don't know anyone but severely lactose intolerant people whom it disagrees with, and only one who doesn't like it otherwise. Is this a think I never knew about nor even considered? A small number of things to do and most of the weekend to do them, but it's better if I start, now. I'll be popping in and out, to see what mischief everyone's up to. :P I'll experiment. Like most people, cow milk and I aren't the best of friends. I do like it in things like cheese, which I tolerate pretty well, the lactic acid being mostly spent, but those indulgences of ice-cream , oh dear. I like my Rooibos with milk and sugar :) @Chai - will see. :) ^That other individual might be present, now. ;) @Pub Cub.. great choice. See if you can get your paws on a South African one Perfectly fine, just DON'T MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN! Grrrr... ;) @Dr.P... yuck, me neither I drink any form of any coffee, often too much, and more as time goes on. @Zem - sorry, realized that I was mistaking you for another. that got mixed betwixt and between a group conversation on such things, earlier. :) Now in my head is a song that Minutephysics and Minuteearth use often, and their music is amazing! It's great even outside of video background music! This specific song: This video from today: <url>" (I know, you don't drink coffee.)" I know we haven't really known eachother long, but... you do know me, right? I have cut down though; I used to have at least a 12-cup pot every weekend, now I just have 3-8 cups most every day. @Anja - open to anything. Thinking of trying a Rooibos, this time. Whatever happened to our ganache KS idea? @Pub Cub.. what's your choice of SLL? 'Dancing On My Own' <url>"I'm different" to the girl in the opening @John - but hopefully they've worked out any kinks. We do know Elan's team is very thorough in making sure everyone receives their reward eventually. Sorry you had bad experiences. I like MJ! They say they are going with Black Box again, near the bottom of the campaign page. @Dr.P... like Michael Jackson @Cup-Cake... I have a Ruby like that...she's a tummy rub sl...uhm fiend So any chance of not having Black box ship? TWO bad experiences already.... he looks like one! he's 15 pounds... and likes to snuggle in the same position you'd burn a baby. he's purring in my ear ad i type with one hand and hold him up in the other I got Peanut Puffs, so nice that Aldi carries some German type foods ? @Cup-Cake... did he turn into a cheeto cat yet? Boom... <url>"IRC is so 1999"???????? I thought it was so 1995. XD Gawd, I'm old :'( Trying desperately To locate my last comment Buried in bear poo *A haiku about too many comments* Yup, yup. Used it recently, trying to compile together a more complete archive of performances and sound-bites from Woodstock. It's probably still there somewhere, I wish we could see it all! One of the best sites on the entire internet, though, is <url>"That's not fair! There not fait, at all..There was time now. There was all the time I wanted..." Time Enough At Last is just a classic, one of the most famous episodes of any show. "Fight For Kisses" <url>"no I didn't deal that smell, this deck of cards did" bit The best part of a s'n's option would be that nobody wants it! What has been smelled can not be un-smelled! ;) Hey, Elan! Thanks for the Update on the Update! ;) -------------------------------------------------------------------------- iXNay on the included odouriffics-ay! (We'll never get those out or forget them - which might be a FEATURE - hmmm, I'll have to think about that.) lol @Dr. P, a passing rabbit could work as well... ;) The problem with that is that the napkin isn't guaranteed to be fresh/clean. @Zem, I've been wearing my "Respect Chicago Cubs" shirt ever since I got it on Wednesday (taking it off at night, of course) and the Cubs have been winning ever since. From a bear's point of view, the best thing about eating a baby is it comes with its own napkin! ;) There would be a great variety to choose from GM... all things baby, several mechanical scents, several animals scents.... @Dr. P, I can't see them not expanding the nsfw option, honestly. I'm just glad to be here, so anything they bring to my table is exciting and awesome! @Elan - Great to hear from you ... O Captain my Captain. Really happy to be a backer. I didn't even think twice about it though ;] Eew! Really? Scratch 'n Sniff babies?! I'm eating, I don't want to think of baby smells! Nor even bears! Well.... besides an entirely new game, which is obvious... MTG sleeves should fit these cards, if they're the same size as Exploding Kittens. I doubt that they would inrease the siz of the box to accomodate the sleeves though, so you may need to find your own box for them. Then again, a box that accepts sleeved MTG cards should work. What scent would the S'N'S be? lol scratch 'n' sniff... I don't know if that is an awesome or horrible idea. On a similar note, if we blow this thing out of the water it might be likely that the booster pack is turned into a full deck like with EK. What has me excited the most though: what new things they might bring to the table! Actually, if they offer up the s 'n' s option, I hope there is enough room in the box for vacuum packed cards! (to keep the smell longer) ;) @Dr. P, I totally agree. My hope is that if they are going to put in extra stuff, that consideration for sleeves and/or a box to hold sleeved cards comes way down the list, after the scratch and sniff option... ;) I think pretty much the same myself. I'm just saying while it is really up to the BvB creators, they have made it a point that they don't want to go too far overboard with the extras either. @Dr. P, in my opinion, if they are sleeving cards, then they should also be fully willing to get a special case to hold them in as well. Unless the card is a trading card, I've never understood why people sleeve them, its like old people furniture still all covered in plastic. They could make sleeves, or a separate box for it. That's a bunch off extra stuff to track though. I think they want to avoid doing TOO much. But you could always buy a box for sleeved cards and keep them in that. @Jerzy, they will be normal playing card size so finding sleeves should be no issue. The box for the cards will be designed for shipping them without damages, not to hold sleeved cards. The sleeves will however be ambidexterous, so theres that anyways... ;) All things in due time Zem. Elan and the Team are stunned? I would have thought they'd expect this! Maybe they're stunned we don't have half a million backers yet. This needs fixing! This is unbearlievable! Look what you guys did to me! I'm bearside myself to the point that I can bearly bearthe! Bear with me as I get my bearings straight. All of class, I was thinking of bear puns! Some were almost bearutiful, and some were stretching it like trying to name a bear artist like Biearre Renoir. It didn't help that it was History of Rock class, featuring such great artists as The Beartles and Jefferson Bearplane! Ah, screw it, I need a bear. Beer! So, who's excited about the Cubs game? ;) They're probably the same size as standard playing cards, just like with Exploding Kittens. are thouse cards gone fit any sleeves? If "yes" then are you making a box for them that will fit cards in sleeves? @BaKhan: I don't get that type of treatment around here. All my customers(yes I can call them that) are truckers down in the states, and their terminal admins/mechanics/managers/dispatchers/etc. I was just going to grab something off of the lunch truck, when a customer ambushed me and took me out for lunch! It was awesome! Aye Aye Cap'n Lee! Lol, donair's come from Turkey, and are extremely prevelant in the arabic countries as they use non-leavened bread (pita). Halifax can say its theirs all they want, but they have existed longer than Halifax has so... ;) They are also quite delicious. Yay!! Thanks. I've added this to the news page. www.cubsubcorps.com/news.html Hey Elan!! We'll all be looking forward to that! Sound like it'll be just as good if not better than last time. It's in a Pita, and it comes from Halifax. How does it differ from a taco? I should have guessed it's Canadian. The Bear and the Baby Donair. (What's a donair?) ... or something else that rhymes. Hey, we should rewrite "The Bear and the Maiden Fair" as "The Bear and the Baby Bare," Well...looks like I ended up with getting a donair. So delicious...but so messy. A bear, a bear, all covered with hair! OK, I'll have to guess then: A John Deere tractor. ...except that's not particularly funny... The answer: Grass, I lied about the wheels. OK, WoW might be green and it might have wheels, but I don't think that's the answer. (I know, it was a reply to GC, not the joke, but I'm waiting with my editor open.) How did you guess @GM ;) @GC: Uh...World of Warcraft? Awesome GC! Yes. What is green and has wheels? Yay, love the joke book! I'm awful at puns and jokes, so I'll just sit here giggling. On a side note, my meowing EK box just arrived, awesome! Guess what I'll be playing tonight... Red paint What's red and smells like blue paint? OK, we now have a Joke Book. www.cubsubcorps.com/Jokebook.html Yes, embrace the pun!!! It's unbearable! It gives paws for thought, but it's so embearassing! My situation is quickly becoming a bit grizzly. This is no Kodiak moment. Never! There is no off-switch for puns, you just have to ride it out. Dang it, look what you've done! All the puns! Someone needs to turn me off again! What about a bear-claw, GM? @BaKhan: I'm trying to decide what to have for lunch: Pasta from the Italian sandwich shop in the +15, or a donair from just next to it, or go to Wendy's, or Chinese food, or Subway....all those are the quickest things to get to from my office. Turn it up, I can bearly hear it! Ah, what would bears be without ears? Ooh, a joke book would be great! ` I thought of one that goes well with the Sub theme: we don't have our bearings straight! Ooh, we're going through the Bearing Straights! Okay cubs, I'm off for lunch, try to be nice to each other, or at least bear-able... ;) Ugh, my internet is being unbearable right now, sorry if I cut out for a few minutes. Will someone please give me some more website stuff to do to keep me from getting in trouble again? Bios anyone? Any new crew assignments? Do we need to start a joke book? Point goes to GM! Dang, I bearly had any time to answer, GM was too fast! @BaKhan: Bear-handed. How do you catch a fish without a fishing pole? Point goes to Brent! Just bear with me, this is one of my favorites: <url>"bear" with lips covering my teeth, making it sound like an old man saying it or something* a gummy bear :) What do you call a bear with no teeth? Uh oh, did we have our first conflict in these comments? ` Ooh, is this Joke "Hour"?! Whee! Too bad my brain is so dead I can't even think of a good joke! NOOO! It's a sign of the end times! Pain! Suffering! I'm too tired to think up a joke!!! Okay, so a rabbit is hopping through the woods and comes across a bear who's looking quite disconcerted. The bear sees the rabbit and asks him, "does poop stick to your fur"? The rabbit, replys, "nope, never had a problem". "Thats good" said the bear, who then proceeds to wipe his butt with the rabbit... ;) My brain is dead already today. Bring on the puns! But really, my brain is completely shot today. Really, really badly, as Patrick would say because I can't even think of anything else to add to this topic. Just one more class for the week! @Dr. P, that was wonderfully awful! Huzzah! @CB, it does, but not the kind that comes from the sky, unless someone dropped it off a balcony... ;P They're* It's a pun, because there're all unBEARably bad by nature. Does it ever snow in Bel-Aire? All the fresh prints @Dr. P, okay now I'm afraid, but yet have to take the bait... How can you tell? How can you tell if Will Smith has been walking in the snow? OK, @Pride365, let's start over. I'm glad you are onboard with this campaign, and I even hope that you will join the crew. Just have faith that stretch goals are coming. I can't imagine Elan would ever run a KickStarter without them. I'm sorry for calling you a troll after just one comment. I overreacted. Truce? @Dr. P, close! He bounces on his tail, so that he doesn't accidentally step on Pooh! ;) Because he's Pooh'ped? Wow, guys this is way too serious here today! We need to inject some silliness I believe. I'll give it a go. So on a bear related theme... Why does Tigger bounce on his tail all the time? lol this is true. But bears are the theme of this campaign. ;-) All the same there was, and is, no need to poke the bear either. Trolls will troll if you feed them or not. Hard to do, when @Pride365 practically DEMANDED that they have stretch goals. No backer has the right to demand stretch goals. That's what I consider to be rude. Now let's just agree to disagree and move on from all of this silliness. the more @Pride365 presses the issue, the more he proves that my original assessment of him was right. Well, all name shaming. That was a mistype. True, and I do remember a very trolly one earlier unless I'm mistaken. All the same, let's avoid the troll shaming and be on our way unless it becomes a necessity. I haven't seen anything yet that couldn't either be ignored or put to rest in but a simple comment. I never named any names, yet I have been called out twice. There will be stretch goals. Stretch Goals are merely promotional and incentivising tools, nothing more. The same is also true for just getting the product in the first place. Also Pride, you weren't exactly pleasant in your initial statement either. Both of you need to reign it in. @Pride: Also, not every campaign can be compared to another. Each one is different. Some add free stretch goals, some add paid stretch goals. Saying that other game companies would(and I directly quote via copy and paste): "They had to have known how this would take off they should have had stretch goals ready before they even started the kickstarter. This is getting pretty ridiculous that they don't have them out yet. Other game companies would kill for way less than the funding here and yet it seems like this campaign takes it for granted. Oct 20 2016 on Bears vs Babies - A Card Game" Is rather rude in itself. No campaign has to offer stretch goals. The majority do because they, potentially, feel they won't get any funding due to self entitled backers who have been spoiled by other campaigns. @Pride: They announced that stretch goals were coming, and if EK is any indication, they won't be your typical stretch goals. It takes a bit more time to see what the community is like before deciding on how to go about creating them. They will likely be achievements that need doing before we unlock a goal. Just be patient, and trust in Elan and team. They delivered well on EK, and I have faith that they will do that again, if not better, with BvB @Mike Kalaba Call me a Troll all you want but you are the one who is being extremely rude. I said one thing about stretch goals and you start slapping on labels. I then defended myself and you are trying to make it seem like I am on some crusade against this Kickstarter. That isn't nice or welcoming but you keep on trucking on with your labels and your making fun of me. @Mike Sounds good to me, Cheers @Callum, Since I am the Chief Engineer, I can add you as Engineer's Mate. @Creeper: Does he lick them, and the watch them for a few minutes, then lick them again? Never really eating it? That's what my sisters cat does. @cha! He'd probably like the spider! He likes to slowly watch then pounce. I don't think the game comes with rules for that, but you could house rule it anyway. So, I just backed the project ($35). Is it possible to double the decks and have up to 8 players? Hi Mike, I'd love to be added to the crew! Having an absolute blast at weekends playing exploding kittens and can't wait for Bears vs Babys to come out now! Can I be the ships Engineer? @Cha! I was just phrasing it exactly the way that last night's tro..er..person did. That's were the 'believe' part comes in. And yeah ...in the eye of the beholder and such An opinion is neither true nor false though, it's just something that is. Truth is a very fuzzy gray ground in the pit of an abyss. @Dr.P... it did! Which calls for one of my fav feel good songs <url>"people who make one very true statement and then leave it at that." @CB ... you don't want to sound excited...all the time? Thanks, Cha!. I didn't realize that there were two different blurbs. @CB...there's two posts, it was all too much for one :) I agree with you about the bang at the end of Cha! Zem. It forces me to rephrase things sometimes so that I don't end up sounding like I'm all excited about whatever I'm talking about. We did a thing…again… Welcome to Bears vs. Babies’ CubSubCorps. We are an interactive fan group that sprang to life out of the Bears vs Babies KickStarter campaign. Aside from collecting information/requests from backers and links to creator information, we encourage fun brainstorming and roleplaying ideas. Please check out our website at <url>#.WAjP5IlOXcs CSC ORDERS: Click & share that KickTraq link to get Bears vs. Babies to the Number ONE spot: <url>…more to come! Morning @CB :) @Cha! Why did you take www.cubsubcorps.com out of your blurb? Don't you like us any more? Morning cubbies, only 60 comments to catch up on ... Some dire love for this morning <url>"Oh, that's nice, I woke up at :40; I only slept 10 minutes and won't be late! Pope of NOPE! I woke up at 7:40 on my own, around when I'd wake up every other day of the week, my brain tricked me into thinking it was 8:40, and then I get to class, wait 15 minutes, and get a big April Fools! To be honest, though, if I hadn't lost an hour even more of sleep, I'd think it was really gosh dang hilarious! ;) Ahoy all me scabbard mates! Welcome or Welcome Back to Bears vs. Babies! Here’s your galore of important info: Bears vs. Babies were created by Mathew Inman (The Oatmeal) and Elan Lee (both known for notorious Exploding Kittens fame). Matthew, The Virtuoso of the Inken Sword came up with the idea for Bears vs. Babies and inked all the fabulous drawings. Elan, The Prodigy of Strategic Mechanics made this game well… playable & sellable. Website: <url>’s more…Click & share that KickTraq link to get Bears vs. Babies to the Number ONE spot: <url>’s still more….There’s a great FAQ with really important FAA on the Campaign Page. Other than that… YES, there has been an update (Oct 20, 1pm EST) and YES, Elan dropped by comments (Oct 20, 2:15pm EST). He announced that they will be able to ship to SOUTH AFRICA! YES, the update included how important stretching is and to bear with them to announce the stretch goals…bear-ware for they are coming! NO, there is no Bears vs. Babies and Exploding Kittens combo reward tier. If you really want to get your paws on Exploding Kittens, you can do so right now for $19.99 and have them in your den within 48hrs by ordering them here: <url>’re at it and feel old enough, just get the Exploding Kittens NSFW edition ($19.99) and the Imploding Kittens Booster ($12.99). Fasten your suspenders, straighten your beard and enjoy the walk in the BvB Wilds! @Dr.P ... it's gloomy this morning but looking forward to doing some battle chef cooking :) You? I am so excited for this project! What absolute genius! I second what @Dr.P said and just have fun with us here in the beariful comments wilds. Doing well this morning so far Cha!? @Geist... received and responded :) Well said @DP! I think there is this thing called sleep, and that a lot of people like to do it. Wow, what happened last night? There were no comments at all! And now I have to go to classes, dang! Just don't let it happen again! ;) Everyone complaining about stretch goals: They are by no means even obligated to create Stretch Goals. You've been spoiled by other kickstarters into believing you're entitled to them, when half the time they cause more trouble than they are worth (I feel that is a generous statement as well...) They could just let it run it's course without them, and we would still get the product we agreed to back. We're aren't buying anything here, we're literally sponsoring them in hopes they'll give us an awesome product. They'll put some awesome stretch goals in before long, and we'll have fun with them. But be patient, and give them time to actually create them. We aren't even five days in and have almost an entire month left. That's the boring PR version. I prefer the Geist's take. ;) @Skolo - if you're wondering about the popularity, the creator of the project is a comic artist, whose work is fairly popular among certain portions of the Internet crowd - 100s of thousands of readers, on and off. So, when a campaign like this, using the type of humor and style reminiscent of of their other work is produced, they tend to jump on it. Also, the creator previous project proved very popular and this promises the same kinds of entertainment. That's basically it. :) @Skolo: Those who back it get magical powers. You don't get to use the powers until after the campaign ends. what is so special about this project? Can someone tell Cha I saw her message and sent her an email? I got your joke Creeper and I completely agree @GC - Great minds think alike! Morning @HC :) I saw your comment yesterday about saying "The Pope of Nope", me and my friends do that all the time too! x Morning @GC x See, this is the problem with living in the UK. 2 hours and no comments! What's going on?! ^right Ah, I put myself through more trouble than I needed in setting up another account, instead of rechecking my other email. Such is the way, but things are al Holy grail, I can't wait to annoy my wife with this. She hates exploding kittens and I thought about a divorce, BUT I found some guys at work to play with. Maybe this will be awesome too :D OK< Anja, sent. Sorry for the delay. It's an email account I haven't used for awhile and I needed to change something or other to get it to forward properly. Should be good to go, now. :) I thought it was funny, Creeper! Although, I have to admit, ALL babies as they are are pretty creepy to me. Maybe becoming a parent changes everything, but I don't see the appeal. Baby animals, though... adorable kittens are my biggest weakness, so I know how mothers must feel. Hi guys, your spammeister is here to help the commen- Okay, time for bed everyone! See you tomorrow! Awh, cmon... i thought my joke was pretty funny... where's Geist? Please check my comments on my profile for the correct email address :) Please do I did not get it @Clayton... it's $19.99 and could be yours within 48hrs :) I did earlier _ I guess it didn't go through? I can retry. @Pub Cub... did you email me yet? I'm still here - sort of. :) You would wind up having a few combinations of possible pledges with that set-up, as you'd need to account for the regular and "NSFW" sets. I guess only two, though as if you pick one NSFW, it might be assumed the other would also be. @Pub Cub...are you still around? @Mike et all the only reason to include a pledge with EK would be for us that missed it the first go around and possibly get a discount as compared to amazon (I will be honest here, I have yet to look it up, price might be the same) so that would be the sole reason I can think of. ^Needs spell, grammar, sanity check..yada yada. ^It's tough though when the stretch-goals are linked to playabilty, though. Some projects set a basic minimum to get funded, but have some nice goals that make the experience better. It adds a good bit of elusiveness and a bit of drama to the proceedings. Not saying those are a bad thing, but when something is missed, it certainly has a "if we only coulda" feeling. Another project I recebtly supported was for a Role Playing plastic model kit that had added inclusions, that as the pleges increased, would "unlock" and either get added to the base set or be available as a seperate add-on kit. The more base kits you ordered, the better the bargain over the evetual retail ould be. There wee a few ambitious things hinted at, that were very enticing that didn't come to be and may or may not be produced when the sets go into production. Ah, shucks. :/ @Melissa & @Mike Agree on both topics!! (Thanks for mentioning the other game, just backed it) The most terrifying baby is "unplanned" in my opinion.... but that's just me. #FlyTheW Back to Wrigley on Saturday! @Corbidorbi, if people want stretch goals, they should go over there. They have a TON of them! @Mike, yeah. That other game is gonna be amazing. Surely this has already come up within the past 3 days but what are your guesses of the NSFW babies? You're pledging for a card game, that has a 99.9998% chance of being delivered. Don't worry about anything else. Those are all extras that don't need to be there, but are fun to have. If the card game doesn't appeal to you by itself, it might be better to move along, otherwise you'll be pulling your hair. If you like a little craziness, word-play/ punnery and perilous ridulousness, stick around and play along. ;) For everyone who is upset about the lack of stretch goals after pledging over a million dollars, just cancel your pledge. Nothing is preventing anyone from watching this kickstarter on the outside. You can always pledge up until the last minute! @Corbidorbi, I found that "other" card game after looking at your profile. Looks really cute. @Mike Kabala So my pointing out that Stretch goals are long in coming is being Trollish? I made one very true statement and then left it at that, that isn't being a Troll. If they had time to make comics about how much we have raised for them then they have had time to figure out and post some stretch goals. We're awaiting those. They may take a little while longer, because the creator likes to work a narrative into achieving them, along with graphics representing the tasks / goals. If you look at the update, you can see he likes to poresent things with a little flair. TBD What's the stretch goals @Corbidorbi, I think they are keeping this separate from Exploding Kittens to simplify fulfillment after the project is funded. You can get Imploding Kittens right now on Amazon.com. I just did, in fact. Any chance you guys'll add the Imploding Kittens expansion as an add on? I apologize if that's already been asked a few hundred times... Just found this. Oh, heck yes! I wouldn't worry about it, @PC. It's not like those people who say, "Great project. Now go check out this one ..." and they never post anything else in the comments. ^I know, I've just done THE FORBIDDEN. It's the last few minutes, and I'm not soliciting, just pointing out another interest. ;) Anothere KickStarter I', supporting , is winding down. The Voyager 40th Anniversary Golden Record set. Just gave a little thank-you, which felt odd, given the screen-name I have right now. ;) <url>"how", this time, that I missed out on before. May not ever use it beyond such shenanigans, but that will leave me a personal record I can look back on. @Zem, we did have a flurry of comments a while back to drown out a couple of trolls. That was fun. *le gasp* 37 minutes without a comment? You all must be so bored your minds are breaking down from not hearing anything from me! Yea Build-A-Monster is a great idea :-) What about Build-A-Monster Workshop? We could have our own build-a-bear workshop if that weren't already trademarked. I'm blanking so hard on the babies Lure 5 bears into the shape of a full new bear with a baby as the head. Or on 'Gilligans Island' , maybe - following The Professors plans, building everything but a boat out of bamboo and cocoanuts. Build a monster (bear) out of at least 5 random parts It sort of felt like being on the crew of the 'Firefly' ship, scavengers. but...those elusive goals ;) I've not touched the babies yet so I could imagine there'll be beary and babyish involved stretch goals How about sending us on a treasure hunt... aww memories of Monkey Island I honestly have NO clue how they kept up last time and actually fulfilled everything almost flawlessly! It exploded so much, but they kept up with it all just barely! That was their genius: They made stretch goals, but only ones they already knew they were prepared to fulfill. If we didn't make them, no harm, but if we did, they were already ready and had plans. They keep it simple, so things don't get ridiculously bogged down. A lot of kickstarters get too ambitious with the stretch goals, and it can cause all kinds of problems. And the campaign will likelt meet more than twice the current funding, so it's nice to have something to fight for, for awhile - makes the accomplishment sweeter. Plus, most of the challenges, last time, were not so much money-related (well, yes, to achieve them usually meant that certain extra amounts were raised), but little silly/crazy tasks we had to complete. Yep, we got lots of trinkets with EK Most of the Stretch-Goals of the previous campaign involved subtle enhancements to the packaging, exclusive to tKS. They didn't effect the way the game was played. So, if we meet them or not won't change the experience - much, but we certainly liked our little extras, didn't we? : Sturdy box and this light-sensitive thing that makes noise on the box. It's just a bit of fun.

Welcome Aboard this Ride! Besides, what other KickStarter has its own organized Cprps of backers? www.cubsubcorps.com Stretch goals aren't the end all be all, and they don't have to be based of backer dollars either. They'll probably do them like they did last time. With a series of trials to overcome. Stretch goals at 1.2 mil?? Way to wait it out, what's the next goal, 6.5 mil ?!? Lol 1,250,000 Remember ... good things come to those who wait. :-) @Pride365, oh they'll have stretch goals all right! They will bring them out in good time. Then, HOLD ON! They had to have known how this would take off they should have had stretch goals ready before they even started the kickstarter. This is getting pretty ridiculous that they don't have them out yet. Other game companies would kill for way less than the funding here and yet it seems like this campaign takes it for granted. RIDDLE?! OH BOY!!! ... wait a minute, what riddle? A rubix cube. That must be the answer to this riddle. Sorry, I'm just watching a livestream, so I'm not here much. Playing with a puzzle with my hands while watching with my eyes. Night HC Yep, Widow's Walk Time for me to sleep - much love to you all and good night x /puts chocolate on everyone's pillow Oh, the expansion for Betrayal is out?! *off to amazon!* I need to get so many expansions I've put off myself! Imploding kittens, betrayal at house on the hill, my list goes on.... <url>` k ` k ` k ` k ` k ` Great, I think Kickstarter screwed up and quintuple posted my comment! Oh, I'd never expect to land right on. this crew being how we are, frenetic and unpredicatable as we are. ;) But, yeah we're on our way. Probably won't reach EK numbers, as many from this group consider that HOME and one can never forget that special love, @PC: Just need to be sure to count the one you're going to post, and hope that nobody is typing as you type. And Rod got it - I blame KS counting SCHEMES. @PC, lol! Now. @HC, I'll keep the sub posted! ;) Awesome! Hope everything works out for you x First 2000 @Zem, I want it to be, definitely, probably not... ;) Is the brittle EU-friendly? Ambidextrous? Plaid? @HC, thats one of the things I have to see about, but I would like to be able to offer it to everyone for sure! Oh gosh, making it Maple Bacon Brittle was a bad enough idea as it is, you can't just keep adding to it like this! It'll never stop! @baKhan - Will you have overseas shipping? I want to be a backer when you do it ;) I wonder who will claim what is coming up. ;) (They'll let you know.) Hahah @HC, me too! & @BaKhan - glad to hear you have plans for it. @GM, you need to add bourbon in there, I was trying to convince him of that very thing... ;) I am a Trekkie so that probably explains why i read it the way I do. @CB and @BaKhan: That's a dangerous idea....Buckner's Maple Bacon Burning Brittle @CB, honestly, I would do anything to help LZ make that happen. Not just because the sauces are awesome, but because he's kc. My wife better explained his situation to me, so seriously, anything! @BaKhan, when you do it, you should offer "Buckner's Burn" as an add-on. @Sally, oh its going to happen, no worries, I just need to take some time, probably about this time next year is what I will be aiming for. ;) And yeah, I thought of the Khan part as well, for obvious reasons, but the Ba- was still Bah- rather than Bay- to me. Weird. @Clayton: Just think, we kept the Exploding Kittens comment section going since the campaign ended Feb 2015...with nothing about the campaign for the majority of it. Even during the campaign there wasn't much unless someone had a question, which us crazy folk answered to the best of our knowledge, or got it from Elan when he was online. Clayton, you must have missed Exploding Kittens! <url>"Ba-Khan" because of the capital K. I read it as Bah-Khan in my own noodle, but picked up on the Bacon reference toward the end of the last campaign (don't remember the specific reference) - took me awhile, though. ;) I just noticed that I double posted. I hate repeating myself ... hahaha Wow, 5 minutes and 12 comments! I'm trying to eat! ` GM, I just got the email like half an hour ago. See, BaKhan?! I'm not the only one to say it Bah-Khan! I'm not weird! in that one respect... @Sally, I want to, I just don't really know how to figure out all the logistics, ie shipping, liscencing... Hi @Sally! @Elizabeth - duly noted and you have my permission to mission. :) I got mine about 5 hours ago @Zem - I say it 'Bah - Khan' in my head. Good time to come back here - Who's doing maple bacon brittle kickstarter? I'd buy that! @GM - I got mine today as well. Someone said in the comments it can take a day because it is such a large campaign. @GM - I got mine today as well. Someone said in the comments it can take a day because it is such a large campaign. @CB, specifically, cross boarder shipping of food stuffs, commerical liscence, etc. @PC - I volunteer as Tribute!! *Or I may prove to be the most covert and subversive of all* ...I think my emails are messed up. I just now got notification that FC was successfully funded, yet their page says it was funded yesterday. Quick poll: how do you mentally pronounce BaKhan's name? I'm betting I was the only one to miss the "bacon" joke until last week upon my sudden realization and everyone says it "bacon" instead of "Bah-khan". @CB, I want to do it! I just don't have the time for the leg work right now. ^Is not particularily brave and a little camera averse, so depending on the tenacity, diabolical scemishness of the mission, I may need back-up from or need to acquiesce to a fellow intern. :) Don't forget the brittle @CB ;) We need a maple bacon KickStarter! @HC: There will be reviews about Maple Bacon Brittle in ~1 weeks time. @HC, I wasn't lying about being the tastiest pirate! ;) Mmmm .... bacon ... Wooo chocolates :D *glub glub* I forgot that a super secret mission in a sub meant we're doing it underwater. Can I take a breath yet? I don't know... I'll wait and see how it goes before the maple bacon brittle hits the table again... ;) Yay, we can all be uninvited or honorarily uninvited! UN - MUTINY! We're better together. Group hug xx /throws chocolates @HC the more the merrier! Alright guys...due to the difficulty of not messaging on here I couldn't really do a secret mission call. I just needed those few brave ones for a dangerous forray into deep dark waters mission right now...we'll send word and for back up when we can. @GC - Then we should include @zem and @baKhan since they showed some sympathy. @CB you can be an honorary uninvited member ;) @CB - I could never hate you. You have always made me and others feel included and valued x Don't hate me because I was chosen. I didn't ask for this, but I am delighted to help out. Now I am craving maple bacon brittle ... @Zem - Maybe you should say that in your email you are being asked to send ;) @Zem, I had to go to defcon BaKhan! *GASP* BaKhan is pulling out ALL the stops! We need to end the war now! It's gone too far! @HC, oh I see how it is... thats cool... no maple bacon brittle for you! Cub Sub 2: Civil War. Invited vs Uninvited Sorry @BaKhan ... the outsiders need to feel special too ;) Wait, so you're saying that if I was invited, that I'm not invited to the univited club.... >.> @Cha!: Message sent. Excellent @GC! Happy to have you. I was wondering the same thing! ;) @HC I'll join you too! @Cha!, email sent! @PC - Don't worry! You can be in the uninvited club with me xx That's what it seems like @zem :[ Not the whole corps @GM - just saying ... We're the elites! *looks down nose at you* I guess. I don't know. Any reason why only certain cub members were included in your message @Anja? Sometimes I switch tabs for 20 seconds and miss 8 comments, sometimes I'm gone for like 10 minutes to grab food and only 4! Got your message, thanks @Cha! Yea what is it about and why was I not included :-( I sent an email to you from my primary email account (which I almost never do) but I haven't heard back, @Cha! What's this all about? Please email me...thank you to the ones who have already done so. Good thing the game crashed, helped me realize it's almost too late to get food already! You can't private message here on KS I know @CB...I tried you too that's why I gave you my email too.. Ugh...Genauigkeit be darned...please message me privately, either KS or email... thank you *sweet smile* Cha has summoned the Corp...somethings up. ;) @Cha! I can't message you through KS. Sent an email. What'choo want, Anja? :) What is up Cha!? I'm just finishing up on Fallout 3 right now, the final mission (DLC one that lets you play after the game ends) and then I'll move on to New Vegas and, knowing me, 4 for a 3rd time.

Winter is coming ... I've been on Neverwinter. I love it :] I've just started playing [DQ VII: The Remakening] myself Zem. I love it so far. A little streamlined so it isn't quite as bogged down, but I still sense that it will be a LONG trek regardless. I did think of underscoring it, but though it looked messy, so went with the simpler approach. But you're right, hmmm... Kevin, why didn't you emphasize the I? It's the same as the rest. ;) Maybe they're not ears, but B.E.A.R.S and are from whatever world they inhabit in the proximity of Ursa Major Oh gosh, albino radscorpions in Fallout 3 have 1500 health?! They're almost as tough as a behemoth! Oh, yeah, you probably don't care much about this, but I just spent like all of my minigun ammo on this thing! That's the bad part of being a high level, I guess. My family is going to be in card game playing heaven You can do it @PC x What gave it away @Kyle? :]] I will be productive today. I WILL be productive today. I will BE productive today. I will be PRODUCTIVE today. I will be productive TODAY. yay for me not being as thorough as I usually like to be with kickstarter! My next question is... does this game involve Bears? It also says how many players down in the FAQ on the main page. @Owen "Great Mountain" @Elizabeth 'Hibernating Cub' aha! I must have looked right past that. Thanks! Yeah, I'd imagine just like EK with size. Thanks @GM x @Kyle: On the campaign page, right under the heading The Trick, where it lists the pledge levels there, the Core one says 2-4 players. @Kyle - It doesn't specifically say but the cartoon depiction of play show 4 so maybe 2-4 players? I don't see anywhere there being any mention of how many players can play this. Did I miss something? Does anybody know? the blew up so quick it seems to have broken the sound bearier Hehe, we could make the ol' Heff an honorary member or something. Hm, but seeing the cartoon jack up there, it does fit quite well... Sweet @Zem!! I'm liking the Honey Jack, and either Honey Pot or The Indefatigable as our sub name. ` Liz, I'm with you on the Honey Pot name! @Zem: Aren't you supposed to be playing a game? 1.2 million! Yeah, @Chameleon, I'm keeping that around in case I need to pull some layers up later on. Never hurts to have a backup plan. All the flags are really cool - tough choice ... @Rod - I like that better x @CB, Ok. Whatever works for you. The PSD I sent is all nice and layered for you, though. ;) @Chameleon, I didn't. I have my own .psd files. I just clipped the honey pot from the jpeg image. When I generate a left-to-right flip, I just flip a merged image. I can always paste the text back in after that. @HC, or Winnie the Pooh... ;) Gotta say, I'm digging the honey pot as the name of the sub! If we don't go with that one, the honey jack is pretty sweet too! Hehehe sorry I can't help myself - A ship named 'Honey Pot' sounds like something Hugh Hefner would own :P I think cartoon jack is probably going to take the cake, though all are well done @CB, If you use the PSD I sent the link for, the HONEY text is on it's own layer, so easy to flop. I added the honey pot jack to the News page. If we choose that one, I'm going to have to create separate images for right and left so that "Honey" isn't spelled backwards. Take care @Zem x Also: Hey Elan! Hope things are going well. @Zem, who's fooling who, you love catching up! and you know it! ;) Okay, I'm going to play a game now. Don't go too crazy here without me, I don't like catching up! Hey, I might still be able to comment while playing even. @Chameleon, thats good, I can't be ticking off my old war buddy! ;) @BaKhan, No ticking off here. :) Let it all be water under the boat and our community healed!!! @Chameleon, sorry if I ticked you off earlier, I was just getting into the whole vampire panda thing... @CB, Cool @Zem, you know its nothing to get too excited about, its only going to be totally wicked awesome! ;) Woohoo! Also, Ahoy, Elan! I really can't wait to see what you guys have planned out this time! Aye Aye Captain! Aye Aye Cap'n! @Chameleon, it looks better as a .png, so that's how I'm going to be saving it. Also, please don't send me any more redone .psd files. After I start working on one, I like to stick with it. Thanks. Now, off to see what this "honey Pot" jack looks like ... That looks awesome @CB! own worst* (if that really changes things. [You are your own enemies] stretch mark goal: Out do yourselves..... We really did do a fantastic job, but we should try to step up our game. We need to beat ourselves! The past us has nothing on present us! Go us!!! We tried, Dave, but they had some really tough ones! We did so many of them though, it blew me away! Btw we better complete all achievements this time! It still bothers me that KC missed a few � @CB, can my Crew title get changed to "That Man" ? Also it's looking great so far. Looks great @CB :]] @CB, Looks like there's a lot of compression on the sub image now. I believe it was cleaner (less compressed) before. Can you save it with less compression? Oh, geez! ... How many jacks did I miss while I was working on the website? The sub is now flying a jack on the www.cubsubcorps.com main page. It may not be the final jack that we selected, but it definitely adds to the "Pirate Submarine" theme. Sorry, @Chameleon, I was working in Photoshop when you posted your latest image, so we sort of duplicated our efforts. Have you considered using plastic cards to be more durable? My exploding kittens pack is not that playable anymore @CB, Here's a PSD with layers of the options for the flag. I made the outline around the bear skull wider so it will hopefully scale better: <url>"Who is he?" "Who?" "That man." "That Man." "Yes, That Man..." Never mind, I don't want that guy, I want "That Man" instead Thanks for the info Anja FAQ ▻ How many cards are included in the game? A bit more than 80. (The NSFW Booster Pack has a bit more than 20) We're still finalizing and will need your help with the final phases of testing! Last updated: Thu, Oct 20 2016 12:29 PM EDT ▻ How many players does the game support? 2 to 4 players Last updated: Thu, Oct 20 2016 12:29 PM EDT ▻ Does the NSFW Booster Pack add more players? Nope, it just makes it so the experience for those 2 to 4 players is even more horribly offensive and awesome. Last updated: Thu, Oct 20 2016 12:29 PM EDT ▻ Why don't you ship to my country? When we shipped out Exploding Kittens, we learned a lot about which regions were too problematic to ship card games. We've excluded those regions this time around. If you've found that we don't ship to your country, please write us at <email> and we'll do our best to find a solution. Last updated: Thu, Oct 20 2016 12:29 PM EDT I like it GM My crew title should be " that guy", because no one ever wants to be that guy. Rob I'm sure worst case you could buy two decks. Though they never specified how many players the NSFW booster would increase the game to. How about the Honey Pot for our ship? Welcome or Welcome Back to Bears vs. Babies Here’s your galore of important info: Bears vs. Babies were created by Mathew Inman (The Oatmeal) and Elan Lee (both known for notorious Exploding Kittens fame). Matthew, The Virtuoso of the Inken Sword came up with the idea for Bears vs. Babies and inked all the fabulous drawings. Elan, The Prodigy of Strategic Mechanics made this game well… playable & sellable. Website: <url>’s more…Click & share that KickTraq link to get Bears vs. Babies to the Number ONE spot: <url>’s still more….There’s a great FAQ with really important FAAs on the Campaign Page. Other than that… YES, there has been an update (Oct 20, 1pm EST) but NO creator/collaborator comments yet. They’ve been letting us play by ourselves in the sandbox so far. YES, there has been an announcement that stretching is important and to bear with them to announce the stretch goals…bear-ware for they are coming! NO, there is no Bears vs. Babies and Exploding Kittens combo reward tier. If you really want to get your hands on Exploding Kittens go here: <url>’re at it and feel old enough, just get the Exploding Kittens NSFW edition and the Imploding Kittens Booster. Welcome Aboard this Ride! I hope a booster for up to 6 players.... cuz I want a table full of body parts and mutant babies... Our ship could be the March Bear HONEY: <url>"3" looks like bear ears... naah. that's too much of a stretch. @BaKhan: Definitely not me! I refuse to count the 5000000000000 complaints already Nice update, @Cap'n Lee. Note how many 1's and 3's the update has! And when the 1st update was posted, we were 31k backers. And October also has 31 days... coincidence? I think not. This is a big bear conspiracy somehow... :v I'm so confused..... I have a knife, Ginger! Don't try me! *throws knife at screen* ... Aw crap. Haha, didn't see that the first time, Sally! As the stowaway, I will steal all the food and you'll never know, mwahaha! But he's a good truffle dog! And so cute! Bahahaha! So worth the wait! (and is that a kitten piloting the plane?) Lol, okay so whos gonna start counting complaints about strech goals? Hey, @Zem, quit throwing my dog around! @Chameleon, perfect! Thanks. UPDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATE!!! Thanks, Kevin! Oh, and popcorn and ramen if anyone wants some. Man, maybe I should just be the snack bar tender! See that we have our first update. ~Refresh your page if you've been on all night~ and you should see it. ;) @CB, don't ask me, I'm just sitting here beating my drum, saying random things, like put your backs into it you scuvy sea dogs! Besides, I learned from Elizabeth, Hibernating cub. She throws chocolates, and there's no way I can compete! ... until now, with strudel! MUHUAHAHAHAHA!!! Soon, I shall have all your jobs! Take truffles! Chocolate, regular AND super-dark! Takis chips! Oranges! Gum! Mints! Take coffee! No, nevermind, coffee is mine. The rest is yours. *throws strudel, croissants, cappuccino truffles, regular and dark chocolate, takis, oranges, an apple, gum, and mints at the screen* No reason not to multitask :D (and I'm envious of random strudel & croissants - sounds like time for Random Cake Day again) The question you need to ask yourself Zem, is do spam mattresses dream wiper's dreams? @Karhu is now Weapons Master / Gunner. Why do so many people have alternatives in their crew assignments! Sally, I already have 2 titles. Pretty soon I'll be a one-man crew! Or one-mattress crew. I haven't decided yet. And Strudel and Croissants from my German class party today. Not entirely sure why we have one scheduled, but I'm not complaining! Just a review day, but with strudel and croissants! Oh no, he's throwing stuff at the screen again. @zem may have to take on the "Wiper" title... Bears.....beets......Battlestar Galactica All hail Zem, bringer of Oranges!!! @CB, PSD with layers and a mast added: <url>#Alternatives without definitions. I'm not a lexicograppher! Matthew Inram, vampire bear flag cartoonist extraordinaire! How about a honey pot with cross bones? @Zem, at least you don't have to feverishly update the website between comments ... Ooh, a CubSub jack designed by The Oatmeal ... SWEET! Wow, I leave to clean my coffee pot and get water for coffee and 14 new comments?! Jeez, I won't be able to play a game today, will I? Or make that Matthew Inman...my apologies Yay new game. The original Kittens decks are a bit flimsy. Mine already show a lot of wear and I've replaced one deck altogether. Just a heads up. Well...we may get super lucky and get a third jelly roger flag option from our Virtuoso of the Inken Sword, Mathew Inram, himself :) @DTQ, but are Vampire pandas, bears? Thats the question... ;) I like the cartoonish one too :) Frankly, I like the cartoonish skull because it scales better. (no hairline dropouts) but it looks like that one's losing in the popularity contest. Can we have a third option that looks good AND scales well to smaller sizes? I would vote for the non panda one as pandas aren't bears @CB, Sure, I'll add a mast layer @Chameleon, I think the jack would look better on a mast just to the left of the periscope rather than attached directly to it. If you would, can you add a mast and let me attach the jack in Photoshop? That will make it easier for me to change jacks if/when that becomes necessary. If you put the mast on a separate layer of a psd file, that would be even better. @Chameleon, vampire pandas have large dogs? Thats cool! It's not a vampire! lol Vampire panda skull ftw! Or the being part of a social experimental conspiracy @Micah, (psst, it's not a vampire. bears have huge canines) ;) I think I like the vampire skull a bit more. Also, Indefatigable has my vote for the title! Sigh still no update what is taking them so long I feel the 2nd one looks like a vampish panda...hmmm @Zem...I didn't put the spaces when I copied...and it's just that much stuff. It's a draft...feel free to play with it. Just so we have things to quickly throw into comments. Did you see the one I put together for SubCubCorps?

Funny how many of these I already know because they're somewhat common and my dad loved sub movies! *giggles* Butt Shark @ Zem Is a "Crazy Bruin" the bear version of a Crazy Ivan? *LOL* B.O.C.O.D. Balls to the walls ;) Maybe have a secondary dictionary for submarine terms. These submarine slang terms & phrases are just gloriously rich! <url>` Weigh-hey! Hey Laddie Hey!

The Bear's Paw The Indefatigable Ursa Destroyer (or something like that) Seacub ` Indefatigable has my vote! Cha!, I had this one in my head just this morning: <url>"The Indefatigable" as EK has kept plugging along, and I am sure the Cub sub shall ever plow the briny sea for many years to come, tirelessly. @Cha!: The BearsPaw is my submission. *gasps*...we are traveling the depths of the dark seas on a nameless vessel! Let the name flood gates open @CB...there shall be a poll of name that subvessel @Zem...let's go to the pub <url>` SuperSlapper: SuperSmacker: SuperTrooper: Vermont State Troopers Could use some definitions, I don't have much time now. #Alternate #IHaveAProblem @Chameleon, no need to send me transparent images. I already did that in Photoshop. I'm in the process of creating layers for the different skull options, so if you send me any more, please keep the tattered flag the same. As I plunder.. I give you options...sword or plank Actually, looks like I can just keep the same outline for both jacks, and put the cub skull options on different layers. :-) @CB, You want the flag(s) on a transparent background? I can save them as PNG I'm liking all these updates! You guys are godsends! And now, just like the EK team, we have prior experience and formats to build on, so it's coming along even faster and better so far! I like the first one better. I actually wish you hadn't given us a choice, because now everyone is going to weigh in on which one they like and I'll have to work up transparency and sizing on both of them. I'm dropping out the background so that I can "fly" it over any image. Mach Schnell, you can never leave! @GM, Cool. Yeah, I wanted to give options. :) @CP: I like that. The second one is definitely my favorite of the two. @Mark Schell: It has a way of always drawing you back into the fold, doesn't it? @Mark, just when you thought you were out, they pulled you back in? ;) Just when i thought i was going to leave kickstarter for good .... @CB, Less cartoony flag: <url>’s your galore of important info: Bears vs. Babies were created by Mathew Inman (The Oatmeal) and Elan Lee (both known for notorious Exploding Kittens fame).

I missed out on backing the fidget cube though... that one was quality too. Maybe we can just "swim" the colors? ;) *lets out a dramatical sigh of relief* awww there you talk to me Dr. P...I am wellish, I've had also life stuff dealings. How are you, Sir, on this fine autumn day? Hello my lovelies! Sorry I haven't been active today - I have much adulting on my schedule. I'm just here to throw chocolates and spread cheer!!! Hope to be back later for some BvB banter :]] Yup! Been doing well Cha!? You all know this campaign will be running over Halloween.... *taps screen* hello hello Dr. P...is this thing on, can you see me? Hey Zem. Under Jolly Roger <url>"black flag bearing the figure of a skeleton stabbing a heart with a spear"...that is sooooo fascinating! Dr. P! Ahoy! ` Hey! I saw that hour break in the comments! You guys need to step up your overnight game! Good Morning! *distributes gummy multi vitamins* Sorry, that last comment should have been hashtagged #Alternative Superupdater - a Creator who updates so often that the trolls complain about "shameless self-promotion" rather than a "serious disregard for the backers." Maybe as a strech goal we can get a water proof flag? Well we could swim a flag, but that would be bad for the flag... Good to see you too BaKhan! @Dr. P, good to see you! @Cha!, raise the colors! Can you fly a flag under water? Trolls already come and gone CC? Ohh..... we could do like a goose chase/scavenger hunt near the end.... though that is a huge pain in the butt with everyone being everywhere to organize. And we need to plun...err raise sufficient funds for their ransom first Rub a dub dub cub sub! How is everyone this morning? They may be held hostage by rival gaming emperiums We need a treasure hunt map No update yet. Some trolls have already given up on the campaign, LOL Haven't seen anything yet, meaning nothing is buried in the comments to my knowledge. Morning all! I was hoping for an update for Elan or Oatmeal of well... maybe this afternoon. Will do CB! @Dr. P, You have been added to the crew as "Mate." You can change your crew assignment. Just let me know what you want to be. Welcome aboard. Check out the Dictionary. There's some great Superbacker aliases in there. Just make sure your fiend don't eat your friends, and all is well in the end. And my friends also ... There it goes! Curious of my fiends will like this game. D'oh! www.cubsubcorps.com Good morning! That link is busted for me CB (CC?). Dr. P proclaimed he will be coming up with an evil pirate name :) Good Morning Cheetah Cub! Need to put together a blurb again with all the pertinent info Maybe make that Cub not cob in the link or it may lead us into unknown interwebz waters ;) Any new people to be added to the crew? And to be correct: Matthew is the maestro of the inken sword whereas Elan is the Master of strategic mechanics Feel free to share the URL with people when you mention the CubSub Corps: www.cobsubcorps.com Good morning cubbies. Good to see you, Dr. P. As I plunder... I think up evil pirate names @Dr. P @Cheetah Cub set up a sub page to the Kitten Corps page with a listing of crews. It's somewhere buried down in the chats along with a wiki link for nautical names galore. Setting the day of time mood... ....as I plunder <url>"...Love won't hurt anymore.. It's an open smile, on a friendly shore." @Andre Let's be honest with ourselves... most of use dropped our money on this game AUTOMATICALLY because of the success of Exploding Kittens.. and not because of this actual game... I just played a Kittens with my family this weekend... it's still awesome. The creator basically just has to say "creator of Exploding Kittens" and sit back to watch the money role in. Same thing happens with CMON in miniature games. Not the creators fault at all. But i have to agree a little... over a million dollars and nothing yet. Not even a hello. This campaign is going to be different... Even if they don't offer stretch goals, how many of us backers are going to bail? Probably not many. "Love, exciting and new... Climb aboard, we're expecting you." And Love, life's sweetest reward Let it flow, it floats back to you" Should I keep going? ;) I kinda wonder.... Is there going to be a Bears vs Babies app? I still play the Exploding Kittens app on a regular basis. And if you ever run into a velociraptor named Kittens who habitually sings, you're welcome. Elan is an active artist with a good deal on his plate. During the EK campaign, he created little doodles to go aong with certain milestones, which often took a day or two more. Don't know if he will go to that length, this time, but it was a fun part of it. Morning all! :) What's in the NSFW pack??? I'm guessing a lot of penis stuff and buttholes. Hmm will probably be around 60k games that need to be made. They should have really set limits. I doubt it can be made and distributed in time. It's really shameful that there is no update / reaction after so many people backed this game. I want a better explanation of the gameplay @Austin Yup they are really dropping the ball on communication Whats going on? Its fully funded, a huge total and not an update since day 1? Wow, I hope breakfast tomorrow is good; I won't have eaten for 18 hours but for a babybel and a pot of mocha I made! Not advisable! Ugh, forgetting to eat was a mistake. ` Sorry, I tried to go to bed, but between my roommate watching Aunty Donna sketches and you guys not commenting for nearly a half hour, I couldn't refuse the summons. KEEP IT TOGETHER, PEOPLE! There, did my job. Time for bed. ` ... don't let me down again. I wish you all pleasant dreams. *distributes extra bear-covered bandaids to the US members of the community, and lollipops to all* Just checking in for the night. Couldn't even make it through the whole debate. I have to digest it in pieces... And, as if a Spam-filled mattress wasn't disturbing enough, you HAD to bring a drunken schoolgirl into the mix. ... Ew. Now I'm going to think of that, CB! Yeah, my bio is long enough as it is. Don't worry about it. It is funny though. I'm more creative when I'm tired. I also laugh at my own jokes like a drunk schoolgirl, which is the first sign of the coming apocasleep. Dang it! Not again! Just like last time, I try to leave and have 6 or 7 comments saying good night! Not this time! *Herculean effort to rip myself away 2 feet over to my bed* Stop it, Zem! You're conjuring up unpleasant images of a mattress filled with Spam. I'm the Kabala, and I didn't even notice Zabala. Good to see someone with an unusual name. Heehee, I feel like that quote "I'm the director...Spam God!" should be on my bio like an interview or something! I don't know why it should be there, nor how it would fit, but I think it's funnier than it probably is, meaning I need to go to bed now. Good night, all! Keep the comments going! NO SLACKING! Now if you'll excuse me, I have to perform my primary duties as a mattress. Good night, Zem. Whoa, Zabala? Didn't even see that! ` I should sleep as well, unfortunately. Yes, sleep is unfortunate! Have you ever been here during a campaign? And you guys need me here! I'm the director of spam! Spam King! Spam Lord! Emperor of the Holy Spam Empire! I'm beginning to feel like a Spam God, Spam God! zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz... Stupid early mornings... just you wait until this weekend when I can fully perform my duties as Chief of Spam! Good night, @Drinkets. Well, I'm off to bed. Good night all Whoa..... We have a Kabala and Zabala!! One thing's for sure. The final game of the series will be at Wrigley. Now they just have to sweep the next two games and call it good. W That lineup is teh brutals No chance cubs hitting having a third straight bad game. 2 outs away from tying the series. holy crap, already over a million with 28 days to go Amand, I'd say no, even though it's requested so much for some reason. This is a different game. Just buy EK on amazon. Cubs are kickin' ass? ` Cubs are kickin' ass! Just a few dozen more games to go... Thumbs up! any chance there will be a pledge bundle for bears vs babies + a copy of exploding kittens? I went once a couple years ago. It was an amazing experience. And the cubs came back from down 1-7 to win 9-7. It was crazy. My uncle, who had always been a cubs fan, was going to his first game at Wrigley in like 70 years. Rockies we're crushing then. We almost left in the 6 th because it was ugly. I felt so bad for my uncle. Then, magic happened. You could feel it. In the breeze, in the concrete, in the seats, it permeated everything. It was as if the baseball gods decided to interject and give my uncle a day to remember. I've never felt or seen anything like it. @Geist, sounds like a Dr Seuss title. Three more outs ... Wow. Dave the Quack came back. That rhymes btw @Zem, sort of reminds me of the movie "Thank You for Smoking." It was actually pretty good. @Tom Karbowski, I'm not from Chicago, but my Dad was. I've been to Wrigley field several times in my life. Nebraska, but breaking a 108 year streak would be goddamn amazing, so Cubs have my vote! I would be more chatty, but the debate also has me in a bad mood. But the beer has me in a good mood. So I've evened it out into an apathetic state. You know what book I'm reading right now? A Practical Guide to Racism. ` There, did that change the subject, CB? ;) By the way, it's actually a really funny book. It's Blazing Saddles in book form. Who's from Chicago here?. Let win this year cubs I'm ok with the cubs winning. NL Central represent! !! @Drinkets, we CAN talk about something else. Double weird Brewers fan here Wow, start talking baseball and everyone disappears. @Zem, we need you! You know, it feels weird to be "Cubs" and "Pirates" at the same time ... Just sayin' Sorry, Vedder. Thanks @Cha! I never heard that song before the 2016 postseason. That's Eddie Vetter from Pearl Jam. No, unfortunately, Dr. P nor many other prominent crewmembers haven't reared their heads round these parts at all recently. Woo Cubs! I want them to win only because it'd be amazing! 108 years!!! Then again, pretty sure it's a sign of the apocalypse. It's in the Revelation somewhere, let me look... For the Cubs <url>"submarine pirates?" Has Dr. P been back? Seems odly appropriate to be talking to the CubSub about the Cubs. :-) Oops, I forgot there was a baseball game tonight, so I'm back. The Cubs are winning, so I'm no longer grumpy. Everyone goes North :) I thought you meant a person not a country Subrats & Pissrine...yeayeah the little strange things that I can find amusing Whoops, hit post too early by accident. I'd say Grandma is probably Canada, though Switzerland is looking pretty good right now as well. Subrates makes us sound like a grocery store, and pisrine sounds like an antibacterial. Slowly... Hmm... Subrates ...Pisrine HeHe say them out loud! Who's grandma in this case? There were submarine pirates in gunXsword? I've forgotten that. Really, a mostly forgettable series but for some really, really great references. Someone said it perfectly: The debates are like your divorced parents arguing over custody for you when really all you want to do is go live at grandma's. Hey guys, did I mention this is the first time I can vote for a president! Oh boy, I can't wait to see who my options are! ... oh. A convicted clown Vs. MechaHitler Mk II? I'm so lucky. Look at this trove of submarine pirates references! <url>#Alternative This user's account has been deleted. @Zem...that's a whole different story ...in which ...I met a bear <url>"Approaching 1 million" I don't have a hoster, either -just something I found with a quick browse. Don't have to register, but they only keep it up for a short time. :) OK, I got "A" screenshot on the news page. It isn't exactly $1 million, but the important thing is that we reached $1 million any way. That also works. <url>"PrintScreen" button, or I can find a better host. @Geist, sure. I've been waiting about 24 hours for you to give me the go-ahead. It will be changed shortly. @creators can we get stretch goals with achievements similar to Exploding Kittens? @Zem, you superclaimer! Good to see we passed the 1 million mark. @CB: If it hasn't happened already, can I change my name to Cocktail Guzzler, First Class? @PC, how come I can't download it? I can't put it on www.cubsubcorps if I can't download it. Glen, that could definitely explain it! I don't know what the Team is up to and what they have planned, but you bet your sweet behind they have some great stuff planned to bring even more people in! I pledged ALL the money! I only found out about this from a Kickstarter email, might be why it's spiking as others receive it too... Thought of editing out the curreny to make it more International, but oops, forgot. OK, that works. *imagines 27000 people throwing tissues at screens* Also: wow, that $12000 went by a lot faster than the last $12K. ya I noticed the sub site has grown, with names and links Time to update the news on the Sub site with the picture of 1 mil! Haha, I love that image, Kevin: You pledged $! Not pounds or euros or some other crap, You pledged dollars! You pledged money! Here, let me see what I can do, Sally. *throws torn up tissues at screen* Subs not dubs! Haha, that has a whole different meaning now if only I could think of a new meaning for dubs! (hardcore anime lover saying for Subtitled, not Dubbed!) Not worried about the update but I was kinda hoping for confetti. Heya Cubs Anyways, here's a capture of the campaign crossing the $1M mark, in case someone wants it. It will only be up for about an hour. <url>` CB, that works great! ` I hope we get an update now. This would be the perfect event! @Mathieu Agreed we need an update asap now that we have passed the 1 million mark Would've loved to get updates sooner and stretchgoals to get my appetite going @Mike, then you don't know Pinkie, she always has exploding thingamajigs on her! Ebploding cats, meet exploading cannon! ... Exploding ... @Koochi, Easy, Ebploding Kittens! I just sent out a flurry of tweets to Matthew and Elan and cheering on the game passing the 1 000 ooo mark, so hopefully, this will get the word out! @night, you also here :P How is it that this just launched yesterday and already made 1 mill and with so many backers :P @Zem, Ooh!

Get your screenshooters ready! Almost just $1,500! I cleaned up the wording when I added that one. Micah, It's easy to hit the million mark... Simply pledge $3,000 right now. You can always adjust later... How about Supertopper - Someone who waits until a dollar threshold is about reached so that he can brag about how he alone put them over. I walk away to make a sandwich and when I come back . . . another couple thousand! I really wasn't gone all that long. I'm thinking $1M will happen in the next 30 minutes. @Zem Ah, my secret was discovered early, I see. ;) @Zem, we need to come up with a supersomething for people who do that. ooohhh how much I love watching the numbers go up! Will this beat exploding kittens??? we shall see. In the mean time I will color OK, cubbies, I'm back. Cappuccino was bouncing off the walls, so I had to take him for walkies. That's good enough, CB, thanks! I'll have to try to think of a great pun. Nearly only $3,000 left! I bet a ton of people are just saving to try to be the $1,000,000 backer so they can come brag about it. MilliBacker: Waits until the $1,000,000 mark to pledge, hoping to nab the milestone pledge, and if accomplishing so (or even if not), bragging about it in the comments. #Alternate @Zem, I got your back on SupeSpeaker. Wow, 5 variations on the same theme in 3 minutes! I told you I'm good at that if I want to be! I want to make a joke about good speakers or a great orator of history, most preferably a combination of both, but I couldn't think of one. Someone help me with that. Kevin, after cleaning the other ports, now you just got that one dirty by cleaning it with the same thing! ` Also, SuperSpeaker: someone help with this one SuperSeeker: I've been searchin' low and high. I won't get to get what I'm after... till the day I die SuperSteeper: Patent pending tea maker. SuperSleeper: Zem the Mattress. SuperSheeper: Any breed of Sheepdog. #Alternate SlackerBacker: Late pledges more often than when a campaign is still running. We've got 40 minutes to hit my guesstimate from this morning! 9.2k to go! So close to our first rendezvous. I can see the gulls circling overhead. At least I think those are gulls and not vultures... *rubs monocle port with sleeve* Woo, less than $10,000 to go now! @GM, I'm not blaming, I'm praising you all for the great effort. @CB: Don't blame me...blame my poor eye sight for misreading one, leading to a new entry. I've seen it, CB, and I LOVE it! It's turning out hilarious! All the little running jokes in it, the patterns, the plays off the same sounding words! You people need to go see what you all did to the dictionary. Thanks! Wait, do you have flotation capabilities? That might be useful! We have a pool out-back that no one seems to use. Strange, that - I though it was one of the nicer amenities. I can mattress. Will that help? *rubs port hole with his sleeve* I see land ahead, but the guinea pigs (they don't originate in Papua - there are no Papua New Guinea Pigs, sad to say) , driving the propellers are taking a breather. Time to grab the snorkels and get out and push into dock. Haha, in the community page: New Backers 3,435 ` Returning Backers 22,997 ` This must be some kind of record! Only 13% of this many backers are first timers! Though it makes perfect sense with EK and all. @Zem LOL that is a perfect description for SuperStreaker SuperStreaker: Professor F. @PC thank you! @Mike Aww, I have the same problem with my cats! You're all driving my puppy crazy. He's desperately trying to get my attention right now. @GC that's a good one :-) SuperFidgeter - someone who can't stop fidgeting ;) SuperStreamer: Constantly live streaming their life. #Alternate SuperSteamer - Fan of everything Steam Punk #Alternate SuperBoxer: Muhammad Ali. LoyalBacker: See Kitten Corps Kitten Corps: See LoyalBacker #Alternate I just do ^ because I'm too lazy and there are a bunch of tags, but all of them have #Alternate in common, so if you're going to search them, that's all you need. Oh, I was thinking Kicktraq or General Calculus as the SuperGrapher! SuperGrapher - Backed projects list includes graphing calculators, graphing paper, graphing tools, graphs, graphite pencils, graphic novels, graphic art, and graphics. #AlternateSuperbackerTags I almost want to make SuperFNAFer, but I don't think that game is a very big topic here. You can put it up if you want, just a very good Five Nights at Freddy's player. #Alternate SuperMapper: A great cartographer. SuperFlapper: Loves 1920s culture. SuperNapper: Pretty self-explanatory. SuperLaugher: Someone with a good sense of humor. Hmm... I'll be thinking of these all day. I've got the file uploader on speed dial. SuperGaffer: A great old guy. Alternate: a great movie set electrician. #alternate Wait... shit! I mean crap! I mean shit, you stole crap! Dang, I was so creative there for a second! SuperCrapper: Backs projects while on the toilet #alternate @CB: Actually...I got one for my miss-reading. Supercrapper: Backs projects while on the toilet. #AlternateSuperbackerTags Man, these are good! Superclapper - Every comment is dedicated to telling the project creators how awesome they are. Even in campaigns where the creators are shite with communication. #AlternateSuperbackerTags LOL... oh yes! THOSE people... Heh heh... @CB: Not going to lie...I originally read that as Supercrapper. Supercapper - Loves to comment using ALL CAPS. Superstacker - Never pledges for just 1 of anything. Add-on maniac. Not a retailer, though. #AlternateSuperbackerTags I refer to it because the numbers are super helpful, but I never need to link to the traq page. I just use it to keep all the numbers flying around straight. And thought it was funny that the trending got up to $22 million yesterday! I wish! @BaKhan - Oh yes! Absolutely! EDIT: Supertraqer - Incessantly links to the KickTraq page of the current project. Showers praise upon those who follow the link. Publicly shames those who are ignorant of KickTraq. #AlternateSuperbackerTags Good one, @Night1505 Superhacker - Writes web scripts to automate the pledging process. Never misses an open Early Bird pledge. #AlternateSuperbackerTags @BaKhan: Yeah, I went and found a GCoD post, then looked through some of his old postings on EK...definitely wasn't him. xD @Night, could we alter that to also include shaming those that don't know about kicktraq or follow the link as well? ;) Supertraqer - Incessantly posts to the KickTraq page of the current project. Showers praise upon those who follow the link. #AlternateSuperbackerTags I just checked the litterbox, and it was definitely PoT! I'm now the smartest guy in my office (which has a total population of me right now) ;) GCoD is from St. Louis and PoT is from just outside of Chicago, by looking at their profiles linked on the comment charts. Was it one of them? @Zem, depends ... How big does everyone want this dictionary to be? Not of course that being into trains would automatically preclude someone from having fun as well... >.> ;) Ooh, just saw the dictionary! You know, I can come up with a ton of words that would work there, if you want. With all of the -er words there, I almost read Haberdasher! (a dealer in men's clothing) @GM, Hmmm I thought it was PoT, and GCoD was into trains? @BaKhan: Was it PoT? I thought it was GCoD. @GM, you mean PoT? Yeah! ... Who was that again, GM? I just remember feeling super jealous about it all the time. And good! Nobody too seriously famous is 20! Otherwise I would have really felt bad. Hahaha, the best part is the child actors. Not too many, but if they were in movies 10 years ago, they're 20 now. Haha, they're all either singers/performers/dancers or were child actors. Heehee, good. I feel young again. You know what I just realized...I haven't seen a post from the one person who had the most contact(and coffee/lunch times) with Elan/Bella. And ... another word goes into the dictionary. ... @GM, I'm all down for un-adulting! Hmmm Nulting (non adulting)? Wow, a guy who edits one of my favorite youtube channel and has his own sketch comedy one with another guy and does a ton of collaborations with some of my most favorite channels is the same age as me?! I guess I'm finally around the age where I start seeing this and thinking, "Wow, that celebrity is the same age as me!" And then the inevitable "and look what I've done with my life." I'm going to look up celebrities that are my age now and feel sorry for myself! @BaKhan: But it means we're not adulting. Heck, we could make YouTube videos of it even! @GM, if one were to play one session of each game I've backed, we'd be looking at 40hrs +, thats a full time job! ;) @BaKhan: I myself, for ones received, have 8-10 at home. Another few on the way(already shipped) and a few that are still being produced. BaKhan, I'm glad I finally realized your name is pronounced bacon after more than a year and a half, and just before this campaign! Especially because your bio would have been REALLY strange and random if I didn't:"BaKhan Beard, the tastiest pirate of the seven seas!" I do still pronounce it "Bah-khan" in my head, though. @GM, that could take a while... ;) Hell of an idea though! @BaKhan: And play all the games we've gotten from KS! @Christina: That works...I'll colour in the fantasy ones I have coming(can they get here now? I would definitely like to be colouring...) @Owen, we can color in the "Oatmeal" Coloring books! @GM, I think thats how I want to redecorate my basement, one giant pillow/blanket fort! @Cha!: Yeah, life does tend to have a way of disrupting the fun times. Which is why adulating sucks, and I want to go build a blanket fort. Bear or bare... <url>"adulting" to the dictionary. If this is half as fun as the last campaign is worth $35 without the game!(still want the game though) Ok lovelies - I have some adulting to do for awhile. I will be back to turn down sheets and leave chocolates xx ^Is admittedly indecisive at times. ;) People are changing names a lot. If I miss one on www.cubsubcorps.com please let me know and I will update it. Dang, Kevin, you used to have the shortest and simplest real name, and now you've changed it like 6 times in one day! Whew, that was more than I expected! Thanks Zem. I just made up definitions for the ones without them. @DrNipples - many of us have Certifications and well-versed in our Fields - the Mindfields of Restless Boredom. (We're much safer here and less of a hazard to others, than taking our addictions, peculiar affectations and other... oddities to the more pedestrian Streets, CoffeeShops, Libraries and Laundromats.) Wow, its first day trending was to 42 million dollars, near double BvB's 22! I hope BvB stays strong the whole way through, though. I hope this one keeps going this strong or more most of the campaign. How about... Superyaker - Claims all x0, x00, x000, xxx, and x,xxx comments. Makes sure all in comments section recognizes this feat. #AlternateSuperbackerTags Hahahaha... SuperSlacker is too funny!! Nice one! Avg. comments per day (EK): 1845. Dang, we left ourselves in the dust. Maybe we do need a resident spammer! Oh yeah, saw we have a new member, Head Sturgeon! Good to have a fish on board the metal fish. ;) (I vote we change their title to sturgeon!) Missed the full definition of many. Superslacker: Spends way too much time at work in the KS comments chatting Since I'm already a mattress instead of a car, I'll take Superslacker! CB, Calc was on here yesterday, don't know if you saw him. Hopefully, he'll pop back in and rejoin our pillow-fort club. I like Superslacker or Studebaker. @Josh, check this out: <url>#chart-daily so we're behind EK by about 600k for the first day. instabacker, babybacker, tinybacker, uberbacker, superslacker, supergamer- only backs game campaigns, supercracker- will only back projects if their pledge will push the total over the goal. Obsessed with claiming such feats in the comments, Studebaker- you are a car, superscammer- one who backs many projects for the minimum amount to get the lame label, supermaker- only backs 3D printers, also creates campaigns for custom miniatures, SuperFakir - Gets all Kickstarter funds from friends and relatives. Sings praises of Kickstarting and seeks to enlighten fellow backers! Wasn't it General Calculus who scraped all of the comments in EK? I sure do miss him. how long did it take the first campaign to reach 1 million ? I would be curious to know if we are behind or ahead ? A BILLION? Crikey - that would be something! Not quite 1 billion in one day, but hey, this campaign did great for just one day! @zem - Probably search it via '#alternate' then because I think we all used different hashtags ... Ah screw it, I'll do it. How long does one have to study for a doctorate in nipples? I am curious ... I can find a few. Just load all... oh yeezus, 1,277 comments, and ctrl + f #alternatesuperbackertitles. I'm eating now, though, so can someone bring up a list of the best? /throws chocolate at @Zem @HC, those are highly educated nipples! ;) Oh gosh, 80 comments in an hour? It's picking up in here! No need for the spam! *puts cans of Spam back into the pantry* Says the backer with 'nipples' in their title ;] #AlternateBackerTags ... anyway to 'search' for them in KS comment sections? I am on my phone ... You buggers are rather bonkers, you realize that right? @GM, added. Weren't there also a bunch of aliases for Superbacker? If someone could scrape them from the comments, I'd greatly appreciate it. @CB - Excellent choice xx @CB, lol, I was actually looking for you as well, the best I could find was a picture of a cheetah on a laptop, like as a skin for it. You made the right call! @HC, or a spell checker... ;) As far as doctors go, I see one every morning when I wake up, and then again when I get home... ;) I settled on a plain old Cheetah Cub. @CB: I have another one for the dictionary. Xomments: Comments that come out of nowhere, and can have devastating effects. @ Rod- the Doctor will see you now. @Kevin PC - I like parties :D @Rod - Hearites? You need to see the doctor ... haha @PC - Love it!! Long live SubCubCorps x Huh...wonder what happened to our original Doc from EK. Avast me hearites! For what its worth, if the keychain had a trinket attached, I be down for that! Trinkets trinkets! I need to find a cheetah cub with a keyboard. @HC nice avatar :-) I also changed mine @Anjanelle Childs, welcome aboard, Doc. All these calls for less Partisanship. Why would anyone want fewer Parties On Ships? (or boats) ;) *confettee* @Todd - I will vouch for you ... @Steve Brown - Well said! @PC - I was 'Mate' or something at first. We all grow up someday ;] Thank you @Mike :D @Elizabeth I was the stow away but then I got promoted :-) @ Mike, I would like to offer my services as Head Splinter Remover/Surgeon @ Mike, I've got actual tears from laughter right now. Possibly distracting a coworker or two. @Anjanelle Childs, it would also be nice if some of the cards were silent, so you could play with them in class at school. ;-) If we can get a new game every other year from Elan & Matt I will be happy as a bear in a baby pile. @Steph, you are now ... er ... "in" the crew. Welcome aboard. @Todd: A forged signature is valid. i have a question for you. The NSFW expansion will be for 35+. Im 34 but will be 35 before the campaign ends. Do I still need my mom to buy this for me? /throws chocolate at @PC ... @ HC, Haha! But..... I would really like it if there could be a keychain. @Elizabeth - Already did! :P Thanks @Mike! :) Haha, not the keychains! @ Mike, will do, thanks! @PC - And don't ask for keychains either! @steff - We need a stowaway :] @Steff 'Ginger Cub', give me a minute and I'll add you. @Pub Cub, you're always welcome here as long as you don't turn into a Negative Nancy. Can I join the crew? Feel like I could be a stowaway ;) ^Admittedly, with this convoluted, ridiculous, superflous moniker, it makes me self-concious to comment over in Cube-land. "What's up with that one?" *eye-brow arch* Think I'll shorten Polydactyl to just ^Thumbs^ @Tom: There were a bunch of us that have been around KS(yes, I know how that sounds, and I'm fine with it). Some, like Elizabeth "Hibernating Cub", Mike Kabala(CB as a bunch of us know him), myself, Zem the Mattress, Kevin "Pub Cub", Josh "Panda Cub", and Rod "BaKhan", all supported the FC, and more. @Tom Karbowski, welcome. Actually quite a few of us are also on Fidget Cube. Ps. I was on FC as well but have changed my profile photo for this campaign ;] @Anjanelle Childs, www.cubsubcorps.com Feel free to choose a crewmember position and I'll add you to the crew. @tom - Hello and welcome to BvB!!! CubSub? @Mikekabala you and one other person I've seen on Fidget Cube Can we have a list of goals? Yay a new game. Backed it. Also bought imploding kittens and should be here today I guess we're going to need a CubSub dictionary page. I have to put "vomments" somewhere. Any chance for earlier delivery dates? WooHoo!!! Almost 25,000 backers! :) @Trinkets, I saw that! It's Drinkets on www.cubsubcorps.com now. @Mike, Vomments is excellent shorthand. I applaud you. Interestingly, I started commenting on Fidget Cube because I missed being able to scroll through pages and pages of comments on Exploding Kittens. Bears vs Babies came along just at the right time for me. Thanks @HC! @eric - Hello x Love it, LZ!! Hello to all cub subbers. Especially the ones didn't get into the KC. Glad to have you on board @anjanelle x @hibernating cub, SO refreshing! I didn't even try to jump into the comments on FC. But this thread feels much friendlier. @PC - I had 10 for Dec and changed to 5 for Dec ... it is a great product and I look forward to getting mine. Now it's time for card games! Oh there was a lot of vomments on FC ;] Ah, Fidgey. Looks like it will go out with a soft bow. Did notice much of the enthusiasm has been transplanted to other projects. It did rather well, though. (I'm down for two, myself.) .I'll try to be there at final curtain, but the after-party is here. :) *sighhh* I love the internet. Nobody in my office ever gets my Oatmeal jokes. Vomit Comments! Vomments? That sounds like I'm vomiting comments, LOL. I can't blame that on autocorrect bc I have that turned off. ... and unlike FC, nobody here tells you you're posting too many vomments. :-) Hi @anjanelle! Isn't it refreshing? I love the positivity here - it's amazeballs! Mmmm ... chocolate chip cookies ... Mmmm ... chocolate ... Can I just say, after following FC for the last 30 days or so, this comment section is like a batch of fresh baked chocolate chip cookies. Love it @GC xx @PC - I could eat a box of those ... mmm Saw this bear with a ginger wig and could not resist (FYI, I'm ginger!) After-8s are good anytime. Can you combine 2 decks to increase the # of players? (like you can in Exploding Kittens) /throws chocolates around even though it's not bedtime ... @CB - Thanks as always my friend x Thank you Oatmeal and Elan for once again shining a beacon of light in this dark world < $80,000 ... I'll bet we get a surge when it gets close to $1 million from people trying to be "the one" who put it over the top. @Patrick Burgess, I'm guessing you're in for the NSFW expansion, then. LOL And it works, so don't question it, CB! Wow, Patrick, that's exactly how we all felt! Thanks for putting it so succinctly and perfectly into words! People think I'm a really creative guy with the website, but all I do is steal the best stuff off of the comment stream and reformat it for the Corps. Woo, chocolate! In fact, I have some right here! ` Okay, sorry to disappoint, but I have to go again, one more class and an event later today. See ya! IT'S GOT BEARS AND YOU EAT BABIES? HOLY FUCKBALLS I NEED CLEAN PANTS NOW! Also, in reference to the title Chief of Spam, I've been here for 40 minutes catching up with over 100 comments in the 3 hours I had classes and just look at this place! Haha, I'm living up to my title yet again! ;) All we need now is our favorite Riddle "Hour", my favorite impromptu event of the late-night crew last time! @Zem, look on the bright side ... you can have all the free chocolates you want! It can hardly be a coincidence, that of all of the languages on Earth, none has ever produced the expression "As lovely-smelling as a Submarine". Heh. :) @HC, you're becoming quite the pro at this. It's good to see you blossoming on this campaign after the way you were disappointed when the Fidget Cube comments went negative. Wow, this is all coming together really nicely! I hope we have another comment section event like Oat's draw anything challenge last campaign, which is what tipped me off to the existence of this area, so that we get a ton of new friends! Thanks, CB! I love it! Ah man, that means you're in charge of me! Dang, I thought I was going to be my own boss! ` Also, Yeoman of the Sheets was supposed to be a more sexual thing, but that's probably a better title since it's more practical. And I'm only for sleeping on. Ooh, speaking of pillows, "Sqornshellous Beta is two planets in from Sqornshellous Zeta, and is inhabited by square cushions who enjoy being rubbed up against, especially with people's shoulders. Unlike Sqornshellous Zeta, it has desert terrain rather than swamps" heehee, the Sqornshellous system has it all for you! Ps. I know sheets are sails but we are in a submarine ... @Zem - I'm sad I missed that! Blame my adulting of course ;] @CB - Change of plans. If I am 'Hibernating Cub' then is only makes sense that I am Yeoman of the Sheets. Please can you make that change and add the following bio: In charge of making sure all the other SubCubClub members get a suitable amount of sleep. Our 'Yeoman of the Sheets' makes sure all the sleeping quarters are comfortable and will often leave chocolates on the pillows for those who want it. Thanks xx @Zem, thanks. I was heretofore unaware of the Hitchhiker's Guide reference. Oh, liz, you should have been here when it was me and Derpy, EpicDerpGuy, the whale! We could keep the comments going all night by ourselves if we wanted! Of course, others DIDN'T want, but c'est la vie. Now Derp isn't here, so it falls on me to be the captain to man the comments. On weekends especially. Chief of Spam is a nice title hahaha Haha, yesterday, Kicktraq's trending line got all the way up to $22 million! Imagine if we could pull that off! Edit: ... to make sure the comments don't come to an abrupt halt. ` Otherwise, it sounds like... well, to put it nicely, the spam acts as fiber, and the comments are the product of the process that expedites. LZ, hahaha, I read that entirely in the irish drinking song game from Whose Line is it Anyway? ! Berth: A fixed bed or bunk on a ship, train, or other means of transport. Chief of Spam: If the conversation comes to a dangerous lull, it falls to the Chief of Spam to hand out free cans of everyone's favorite canned, precooked meat to make sure the comments keep flowing. ` My bio: Mattresses, as defined by the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: "Mattresses are friendly, dim-witted, docile creatures capable of speech. They are all called Zem and live in the swamps of Sqornshellous Zeta. Many of them are slaughtered, dried out, and shipped around the galaxy to be slept on by grateful customers, though they do not appear to mind this, one noting that since they are all called Zem they never know which of them have been killed anyway so their concern and grief - "globbering" - is kept to a minimum." Less than $100,000 ... *small, rapid happy claps* That was luverly. Oh high-dee die-dee high dee die dee die! I went out to the long boat And set straight to the oar I drank a pint of whiskey And ran aground on shore The time I spent on wet sand Was less than under the sea Me time aboard the Cub Sub 'Twas merry as can be We broke through the the sea brine And rang out our cheerful song We spilt the rum and brandy And pushed the boat along Oh high-dee die-dee high dee die dee die! @Zem, whatever you write I'll put in your bio. ... within reason, of course. Also, wow, a pirate submarine? Where'd that all come from? It's fun, but not at all what I was expecting from a sub full of bears! We also need to finish the anthem lyrics! I'm not the best at that, unfortunately, but it's just redoing the Yellow Submarine lyrics. Just putting this back up here for new people or ones in need of title: <url>` Those two are great places to find a nautical job title. ` And don't forget, "Yeoman of the Sheets" and "Yeoman of the 'Powder Room'" are perfectly available titles. ;) Ahoy, all! Cha! is here! Music for all! ` Ooh, CB, how do I get my titles in like that? My descriptions? I'm a mattress, so... the bed. Heehee. Hah. :) Ooh, over 1000 easily! Forgot about that. Wonder who got it. OH GOD 97 COMMENTS!!! I'll try to hit the beginning and end, but I only have an hour! And who's to say a sub can't be used as a pirage ship? Arrrrgh! @PubCub, congratulations. Your clever turn of a phrase has earned you the first spot on the CubSubCorps New page! @Kaitlin Lee I am guessing you have not seen the NSFW version they did for Exploding Kittens :-) (I may have fudged the time, there, but it sounded good.) 24K backers, in less than 24 hours. Hey, I'll take that! Wait, Sub, not Pirate Ship - small bit of miscommunication, that. ;) Yarr, yee two-legs -If you be so lucky - yarrr. Now that we have assembled our motley crew of poets, makers of ponderous, yet beautifant things and scallywags, alike, stocked up on provisions, libations, greeted and gotten smashed on each others company- say we get out our lovely coloured wax pencils and draw ourselves a lovely map to adventure - x marking the spot, aye? I see Booty up ahead (oh my!) errr, and it seems a fine take : Six knocks on yee Magic Tote board : $1,000,000 ahoy! Tarrr, I say, Yaaaaaarrrr. *cough* *splutter* Heyas, Cubbies. How is everyone ? :) @Cha!: Long time no see. How's life treating you? On the first day of work up my Coxn gave to me a black painted submarine. On the second… -2 SSE’s. 3rd – 3 Part 3’s. 4th – 4 bulkhead doors 5th – 5 bottle groups 6th – 6 tubes ablazing 7th – 7 LP Master Blows 8th – 8 wardroom wankers 9th – 9 Cross Connections 10th – 10 Bow down angle 11th – 11 Aye, aye, Sir/M'am 12th – 12 hours to Submiss Ages 35+ for the NSFW version?? lmao @CB: Will do when I get a chance. Launched a day ago, already $870k over goal. Impressive. Most impressive. @GM, I have mentioned your minions in your bio. Soooo... Shipping to "South Africa"... I've backed for Lesotho, since it is the country INSIDE South Africa, so hope it can be dropped off on your way there... PLEASE, tell me leaving South Africa off was just a mistake. EK delivered to ZA. @GM, duly noted. Can you write up a bio for me and include your minions in that? Hmm...if we're going the same route as EK with our minions...I preemptively claim the Dragubs. Dragon Cubs. :P If I could get The Oatmeal to do a drawing, it would be a drawing of a cheetah using a laptop computer. Those drawings are so cool! So exited to be backing this! @GM- you can always refer to me as creeper! @CB - I checked your links. Firstly, I am even more honoured to be included in the SubCubClub and secondly, my husband would be over the moon if his wife had anything custom done by Oatmeal in his wife's name. (hint hint Oatmeal). But seriously - it's so awesome to see how supportive the team behind EK was of its backers. These kind of elements make me very happy to give my investment monies! Okay, so I could not resist.... I LOVE EXPLOIDING KITTENS so i´m into this one two! Because.... well it´s simple YOU EATING BABYS!!!! AHHHHHH!!! Can´t wait. Come on let´s get this Party started and make it even good as the last one! The Oatmeal actually did drawings for some of us. If you can find the time, Check out @Geist's avatar at <url>"The Oatmeal." I'm going to keep referring to you as 'MK' @mike if that's ok? @GM, I have no problem with that. Just don't call me. "Late for Dinner!" @CB: That is true...and I will still call you CB because that's how I know you. :P @GM, not to mention my own CubCorps name, "Cheetah Cub" ... another CC Watching the numbers in the first two hours amazed me - I have never seen that kind of immediate interest in anything on Kickstarter. Was it immediate with EK? @BaKhan: I might jump on that boat...it could get very confusing otherwise. I mean, we have Chameleon Cub, and Cub Cake...both can be referenced as CC. @Creeper, love the new cub sub name! But Ima still call you Creeper, savy? Less than $125,000 to reach our first million. Only 200k backers to go! @Cub-Cake: It feels strange calling the old crew by new names. :P 239th Most Funded. Feels so strange to be watching the numbers again Currently 48th Most Backed project. Thank you Mike, for telling! I think Elan should send an update out through the EK campaign, to let folks who may not be in the know, know, you know? Well, if we can hold with the last hours numbers we should be over 1mil in 8 hours... it does seem a bit slower than last time. @Steff: Oh, the 1 million is a guarantee...though I think my original estimate of 2.1m in the first 24 hours won't be accurate. @BruceP - just sat here for 2 minutes watching the numbers go up and up! I'm sure we can get to $1 million! Come on $1 million! We can make that today, yeah? @BaKhan: I think this campaign needs some more Drunken Sailor by Irish Rovers You know what this campaign needs is a good sea shanty! When I get some more time, its on! @CB, agreed, the shenanigans are going to be amazing! ;) @Mary Death, if this campaign is anything like Exploding Kittens, there WILL be stretch goals, but not in the traditional sense. It's more like a scavenger hunt with Cap'n Lee. Hang on for a wild ride. Will there be Stretchgoals?? @HC, I had a lot of practice with the Kitten Corps. @GM - Hello x @MK - Wow! You are doing an awesome job my friend. I am loving it x Good morning Cubs! Glad to see things are coming along nicely here. @Steff - That's so great to hear! @HC, your icon image is now on your bio page. (click through on your name to see it.) Thanks. Love Exploding Kittens! So excited for this! Loving the CubSubCorp chatter, brightening up my work day! ;) @Trinkets, aye, that I did laddie! Tell me, have you ever been in a storm at sea? ;) Hehe, BaKhan said coxswain Looks awesome! I changed my profile photo to be extra 'HC' - plus it helps promote BEARS v Babies ... which is why we are here! @HC (short forElizabeth, or "Hibernating Cub"), just doin' my job as Chief Engineer. Thanks for the shout-out. Nice English ... I meant 'IT looks great' ;] @Mike - It's look great!! Thank you so much for including me. It's a real highlight to be on the 'high seas' (or underwater?) with you xx Love how www.cubsubcorps is coming together. I love adding click-through links for crew assignments and crew member bios. Keep 'em coming! @CB, thanks for adding me! ;) @Elizabeth, lol! I don't know if they still use the midshipman term in the navy, but if they do, you totally could be! A midshipman, is another term for, get this, a sub-lieutenant! ;) @Rod - I like Coxswain. Besides - does a sub have a Midshipman? Wouldn't it be 'MidSUBman' LOL @Elizabeth, well, coxswain is a legit seamans term, its the guy who steers the boat, and beats the drum! ;) Of course, a totally worthless job on a sub, but hey, thats just me... ;) @Rod - 'Tasty Pirate' hahahahaha Wish I had an imagination like that. I just tried to pick an actual seaman title ;] @CB, well then, if its not taken I would like to be the coxswain! OR BaKhan Beard, the tastiest pirate of the seven seas! ;) @BaKhan, easily fixed. Just pick a crew assignment and tell me what it is. @Joe, I don't think it does at this point. I might be mistaken, though. @Elizabeth, good to hear, fine by me, but then, as I'm not officially listed as crew, you'd be best to swashbuckle yer way on! ;) @Rod - Quite well my friend. Permission to come aboard ;] @Elizabeth, how fair the seas today? ;) Hi, was wondering if backing the $35 option opens the game up to more than four players? Ahoy @Rod! Ahoy all you scabbard mates! @mike - Please can I be 'Midshipman'? It's an apprentice officer and I think that fits me since I wasn't in KittenCorps. Hehe, swab the decks @Elizabeth, any thoughts on your crew assignment? @Cha! elegantly put. I added the description as a click-through on your crew assignment. I encourage others to do the same with their crew assignment. @Micah - I would love a title but I am also happy being crew. Someone has to swab the decks ;] @brian - I also insta-backed :] Instabacker #AlternateBackerTag Yey! I see some crew members are here. I was lonely without you. Gotta do some plund...uh work. Throw some tunes in later! there goes my night-out cash for a month. hope you're happy. Brian, same here. I was like "You had me 'I made a new game'"... lol @Mike... I'd be honored to become the cubsubcrew's Chief Bard :) From what legend tells us of pirates, it seems only fitting that musicians were hot property aboard a pirate ship and skilled ones, were high in demand. Most of the time, musicians were employed to keep spirits high, providing on tap entertainment, playing a jig or leading a number of sea shanties. Often their skills were needed to make dull and boring tasks more bearable, like mopping the decks to the sound of sea shanty or playing a jig to celebrate a windfall. On a strategic level, musicians would have their place in battle too; drums and trumpets would thrash out discordant sounds to demoralize the enemy and inspire the pirates after their booty. @brian - This guy! @Cha! we missed you last night. It wasn't the same without your tunes. Is it OK to add you to the crew on www.cubsubcorps.com as Chief Musician? I insta-backed this one. Didn't even read what it was first. I wonder how many people were like me. ;) Uh oh here we go again. I bite ;) Look at all those lovely familiar faces :) Funding slowed down after I went to bed. Let's push this to $1 million before noon ET. Maybe even Yeowoman. ` Ah, I have to go for like 3 or 4 hours for classes when it's busiest! Nooo!!! ... or Yeoman of the Yeomen ... And everyone, I wouldn't worry about the rules yet. They have it worked out and may even be working out a few kinks in the rules. For now, enjoy the amazing campaign, and soon enough they'll let us know everything when we're about to get the cards Daniel, I think what will probably happen is that everyone will be allowed to play a pre-first round. As in, if everyone has cards to play, they get to play them immediately and then replenish to the full amount. Hi everyone! Also, in regards to the CubSubCorps, Just putting this back up here: <url>` Those two are great places to find a nautical job title. ` And don't forget, "Yeoman of the Sheets" and "Yeoman of the 'Powder Room'" are perfectly available titles. ;) Aye aye, @LZ. CB, go ahead and make me the Brain Bosun! @Stephen Rioux, some backers are increasing the amount pledged to get multiple decks. Others are pledging a dollar so that they can watch the campaign for a while before deciding whether to increase their pledges to get a deck. These will not show up in your calculations. @Stephen Rioux people can add extra decks for $35 each, so even though they have pledged way more than $35 they will show as 1 backer in the $35 bucket. 50 new comments?! I expected nothing less! I have the same concern as Jason, seems to me the first player will always win? To the creator, can you post the complete game rule? I would also like to know if it must be a "complete" bear for it to battle babies. Am I allowed to play a headless-bear with just 2 cards (body and leg)? Stephen. I backed $70 instead of $35 because I'm sure there will be some exclusive treats that I want to give to my as a present with the original game. The math is not adding up with number of pledges to the total. As of this morning when i checked here was the standings. $25 Tier - 1,404 backers = $ 35,100 $35 Tier - 20,914 backers = $ 731,990 22,318 backes for a Total of $ 767,090 Yet total pledges showed 22,386 backers for a total of $834,154. Differnce of 68 more backers and an extra $ 67,064 in pledges. Please explain. I have screen shots. Its hard to believe that these extra 68 backers would donate over $1,000 each, but maybe I'm wrong. Good morning, cubbies. We're still looking for crew members on the CubSub. Mosey on over to www.cubsubcorps.com when you get the chance. @Elizabeth, have you decided on a crew assignment yet? Right now you're listed as "Mate" but I'd love to promote you to a position of honor. Just let me know what crew assignment you'd like. *drinking Phone is at it early Good morning all. @Geist, I was driving at the time we came up with it. Going to be interesting to see what the stretch goal will be. Not safe for children? My sister will be the judge of that when I, the cool aunt, bring my NSFW deck to play with my five year old niece and seven year old nephew. If I can get them to run around the house for a couple of days yelling "peepee" at each other, my work is done. SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!! Appreciate your comments, @Mark Shaskey. I saw that bit about strategy, but if I'm in the lead and have enough strength to survive an attack that my opponents won't, then they're decimated, and I don't see how they could ever really come back and come out on top. @Jason Conlon I took it in part of the strategy to know when to create a battle with the babies for your opponent who has started to build up their bears but not strong enough to take down the army. This creates the balance of being able to knock out the leader at the right time. HOWEVER, I do agree that we haven't seen quite enough to dismiss your concerns, I just wanted to share what I saw from my perspective based on the video and write-up. Can you ship to India? Close to 10% of of what Exploding Kittens made in the terms of backers for its campaign - 219,382. Very few projects capture lightning in a bottle, like that, but it is a healthy start. Have to get a few hours of rest, before I make my morning rounds. Be interesting to see how it goes later. I loved Exploding Kittens. And I want to love this game too, but I'm dubious about the gameplay mechanics. It seems to me that whoever is in the lead (presumably the first player who has had the chance to take more actions) would likely stay in the lead. Sure, you can take an action to Dismember them, but then presumably that's cost you an action to build on your own monster so it wouldn't really be catching up unless all the other players do the same; but they don't want to fall behind either, so would they..? This KS doesn't provide the complete rules; there's no actual gameplay videos; and there's no validation from an independent game reviewer to say the game itself is actually any good - all of which only makes me more uncertain. Please ease my mind, Elan, with some or all of the above! Wait, did someone say vodka earlier? Yes please! (I know it's morning time but as the old saying goes...it's noon somewhere) *blink* Why didn't I think of drunken sailor first? This is what I get for working too many hours and not enough sleep ^Exansion from just being an expansion deck toi a stand-alone deck. Well, in te original Exploding Kittens campaign, the expansion of the NSFW deck was a "Stretch-Goal", that wasa unlocked. We kind of expect something similar here. :) How many cards are in NSFW booster pack? In Exploding kittens this pack was enough to play game with the same number of cards as originial/first edition. But here it is not mentioned the number of NSFW cards. I doubt it is the extra pack for playing just with NSFW but it would be fair to mention the number (as a lot of people think they will get 2 packs) I just checked my EK decks - the NSFW cards have 'NSFW' typed in small red text on the face of the card. Other than that, the cards look identical to the main deck. Hope that helps! @kevin - Thank you x @nathan - That makes sense. I haven't had my coffee yet so I probably misunderstood ;] I think Nathan was wondering if the cards might have a difference in graphic design so you might be able to distinguish where / which theme they were meant to go under though, there might be individual descretion used, of course.) Many mix the decks to boost the number of players. Though, if they were different in appearance, that might add some anticipation as to what other players have, might act as a "tell" in some cases, possibly removing some surprise. Morning idle! Leo sends his love!! @nathan - The EK cards came in two boxes so the cards are already separated. One deck is NSFW and the other is the regular deck. Morning @tsveta! Morning Elizabeth. Guard the borders while I teleport to the office. @Nathan Showers - on the Exploding Kittens decks, there's a very discreet 'NSFW' hidden in the same corner on all the cards. I'd expect that to be on the NSFW deck in this case also. @Tom - Cube people moving to Cub people :D @Nathan don't know but should. @Mike you can, shipping is calculated in the survey. Add along. @mike - The cubsubcorps website looks fab x Good Morning Lovelies!! I see this campaign has EXPLODED whilst I slept. Time for some coffee :]]] Are add-ons allowed? if we want multiple copies, do we just double, triple, etc. our pledges? What about shipping? Will there be a symbol or icon on the nsfw so I can remove them easily when playing with a younger audience ? Hiya Creeper :) Kiss the furries from me. No, wait, that sounded kinda wrong... Morning, Zem. Three hours to lunch, four hours to the massage. You left early, shame on you. Night, Zem. Yay Edward!! Did you get the expansion pack for EK? LOVED exploding kittens (still have an unopened set for...reasons) and had to back this! Cant wait to play You know when you work 15 hours, and crawl into bed, -'d suddenly remember you were supposed to feed your friend's cats and give one of them medication? ...one hour, two cabs, and $20 later... hi again. @Mikekabala hey it's you. Seen you on the cube project People must be stirring. I can smell the PG Tips from here. Instantly backed. :) 20k backers. Omg It is still early in Europe. So just waiting to the uk group come in now @Andy, LOL. Just yesterday I was telling myself not to back any more KickStarter projects for a while. I'm still here @Grizz. Instantly backed! The wife saw me browsing KS AGAIN and rolled her eyes. Then when she saw this she asked if it was the same creators from Exploding Kittens and she instantly clicked "back this project" lol. @CB still around it has been pass 750k already good night @Zem Today was a really good day, though. Seems we got our core Sub sub-corps corps arranged today, hopefully recruitment will go strong throughout the going of the campaign! This one is going slower but promises to be stronger than the first! Keep the comments going strong! Good night! @LZ, OK I'll wait. Listing you as "Mate" until then. Alrighty, it's midnight 30 here. 7 hours of sleep if I slept now, and considering my entire week goes very strongly in correlation with how much sleep I get on monday (or in this case, the day I get back from a break), I need even 6 hours and will have to fight through tomorrow. 6 hours to me is I think something like 4 1/2-5 for normal people. I hate that I love to stay up late! At least on weekends I can stay up to greet the European Crowd! I'm thinking I should be the Brain Bosun. I'll have to sleep on it, but that's the direction I'm leaning. Thanks, Creeper! My expansion comes friday. Dang, guess I should have anted for faster shipping! LZ- have missed you. Posted on EK. Sending you all my love. Should be getting the expansion, shortly, yes. :D Thanks, me too. As for my crew title... Let's see... @LZ, I just read it. I hope it works out OK for you. With all the excitement- did you guys receive your expansion pack?? I got mine just now! The cone of shame!!! We're all part of a submarine crew. www.cubsubcrew.com Also, LZ, for your title: Just putting this back up here: <url>` Those two are great places to find a nautical job title. ` And don't forget, "Yeoman of the Sheets" and "Yeoman of the 'Powder Room'" are perfectly available titles. ;) My crew assignment? What's that? You'll have to forgive me; I received some bad news this afternoon. You can find it on the EK page. Hey, LZ! ` And on that note, good night everyone! You may call me by any of the ridiculous, extraneous bits of my moniker. It's all there to poke at and misuse. :) @LZ, good to see you! I need your crew assignment for cubsubcorps. Hey, all! How's it going? @Zem, hopefully I'll have cross-links between both sites in a day or so, along with links on both sites to the BvB KS. If I don't have links by Friday, please remind me. CB, so it is a Sub-corps sub-domain! Awesome! Will there be a link on the KC site to it and vice versa? I've seen some of the pictures of Lil' Nugget, though not in awhile. I only check your instagram when you remind me. What? Aaw, poor KittyKitty! I don't like to say it's not a good sign, but I know cats too well. Let's hope she turns back up before winter knowing you take good care of them! Aaw, Creeper, you did change your name? Dang. With everyone changing their name like this, me calling to them is going to sound weird to people who don't know it. Also, it's like making a sequel to a classic: it's never as good and you just go on thinking of the original name anyways. I think we should just know the cub names otherwise unless it's your first nickname, but that might be controversial. Oh well, not my decision to make. I'll always be Zem, though. Mattresses are my spirit animal. 3/4 of a million dollars on DAY ONE!!!!! "Kisses to both of you" As in me, Polydactyl McVittles (it's just a fun name to type), or his file uploader? Cuz either way, like CB said, Aww ... (blush) @Remiam- wise choice. Can't believe some of you were there when I first found him. I haven't seen kittykitty in about 8 months. :(. There's a whole new fleet of kittens in my backyard currently. B helped me name a few when she was over! @Melissa "Cub-Cake" Nicole Considering the Pastry Chef was 6'3" and I am 5'5", absolutely not. @Zem, the hard part was making it a subdomain of www.kittencorps.com ... The file upload part is easy. Home now. More vodka? Or bed? Where's Geist when I need her? Btw- Leonidas Nugget Little Butt is doing well!! I shall try to upload pictures to the litter box, but there are also some on my Instagram Aww ... (blush) Kisses to both of you. My file uploader is getting quite a workout. Thanks all. Great idea Zem. Now no one else can claim either Executive Chef OR Pastry Chef. Wow, CB, we're giving your website refining skills a workout today! How many updates to the site have there been? @CB right right. Thanks for the reminder! @remiam7 - never made that mistake again, did you? Or CB. That's easiest, and CC just sounds weird, especially after so long of CB. Like you were demoted one letter! Polydactyl McVittles?! Hahaha, what the heck? @Cub-Cake, I prefer to be called Cheetah Cub, if you don't mind. Thanks. CB, like you did with mine, make Pastry Chef Creeper's secondary, that could work. Congratulations, @Pub Cub, you've gone from having the shortest name to having the longest in one fell swoop. Really? If you did that, I'd LOVE to be your pastry chef! Wait, I wouldn't be able to eat any of it, would I? Nevermind. Well, as a Sous Chef at one time, I learned never to put several prepared whole roast pigs in the Pastry Chefs cooler! @kabala- I saw your "I won't cross creeper" much appreciated. Respect. Did I also tell you B and I had a chance to *finally* meet? She was in New York for awhile. She came over and we had dinner and a nice backyard evening! So wonderful! www.cubsubcorps.com has been updated to list @Cub-Cake as Executive Chef per her request. Testing, yar. @Cub-Cake, that's why I wouldn't let @Panda Cub take Pastry Chef. Also- I had two very strong shift drinks after a 15 hour shirt.., in sorry if I don't make sense Executive Chef is how it would be listed. Although I am a pastry chef IRL. I noticed someone say sous chef is more important than pastry! Yeah yeah... I get it,.. but stilll... :( !!!! I'm not sure how I'd feel with someone else having pastry chef title. They may hav sous chef. lol ya I am looking for the 1mil mark before I go to bed in the morning. Nearly 1/10th the backers of EK! @Cub-Cake, you have been promoted to Master Chef. Now I have to stay up until we reach $750,000 Oops, that's 35th Most Funded Game. We're only 62nd most funded overall. Hi Creeper! Though I imagine you won't be around long, so also Goodnight, Creeper! Remember how "Most Backed" became a big thing and something you could search just because of EK? Haha, it blew everyone away! ` Thanks, CB! That's hilarious as a secondary title, and very accurate! I'm. So. Tired. 35th Most Funded Maybe 1 Million or a nice round day or 24 hours, mayhaps. Whatever is easier. The captain might like 'is shut-eye. ;) ya I will be here for another 9 hrs in and out with overnight work I need to get some sleep, but I can't pull myself away from my computer screen. ya I don't know but what I can tell is we should reach that is about 4 hrs 20,001 Backers! I wonder are they waiting for it to hit one million before posting the first update ? ok back and ya wiper works as Zem says it is a title that needs to be on board the cub sub @Zem, Chief of Spam it is. 63rd Most Backed! Jeez! ` Oh yeah, I was going to do something, wasn't I? Darn you, internet!!! Ah, someone already put me up there. :) Currently 294th Most Funded after less than 1 day! Now, I'm going to take a shower. You guys think you can keep up the chat without the Chief of Spam here? Ooh, that could be a secondary title! hehe Weird, I added Wiper and it took forever for the website to update. It didn't show up until I updated the URL forwarding to the same thing that it was already set to. Chief Engineer can be a confusing job at times. ^Oh, I guess I post enough - I'll think about it. ^><~ Wiper[edit] The Wiper is an unlicensed member of the engine department, usually with the least experience. Also a really funny title somebody needed to take! ;) Also, anything to do with gunners would work since we don't have any of that. Maybe Torpedo Master or Armorer or something like that. Some type of torpedo captain. @Grizz, anything that isn't already taken on www.cubsubcorps.com is available. If you want to think about it for a while, I can add you as a Mate and then change it later. no to drive be back in 30 ^No, not really. I have a habit of being prolific for short spurts, then being absent for stretches, to return later. Not very consistent, I will take wiper lol yes sorta, Just putting this back up here: <url>` Those two are great places to find a nautical job title. ` And don't forget, "Yeoman of the Sheets", "Yeoman of the 'Powder Room'", and "Wiper" are all perfectly available titles. ;) I was reading a really good creepy story, sorry. Apparently the god of spam answered my prayers though! @Kevin, do you have a Cub name? so what positions are we missing on the crew roaster. ok I have 3 mins as I am waiting for food in a drive througj ^Obligatory. Must. Have. Comments! Crickets again? Even Zem is asleep! ya I am driving to work I be back in about 30 mins Even Eric Idle liked a little SPAM, every now and then. <url>` Show 1 newer comment Oh thank God, you saved us! When's Asia going to wake up? This lack of comments is forcing me to actually watch the baseball game the Chicago Cubs are losing. My beer is a .08. No driving tonight. @Zem, that works too. I literally almost typed "My beer is drunk"! Should we intervene on your behalf with your phone? I mean, like you just said, it even ends the day with a beer! This has to stop! You need a phone intervention. Alright, beers gone. Off to bed. I told it to go to rehab, it said "No, No, No!" EK had approx a 12:1 ratio of $35 to $25 of reward tiers. We keep telling you, Trinkets, send it to rehab! At least you have actual reasons, Kevin. My phone gets drunk from time to time. Oops, I forgot I already posted his photo in the Litter Box. Thanks for the reminder Zem. He's twice as big now. Don't mind me, I'm always addending my comments, as I always miss the obvious and am terrible at proof-reading. (I'm on a phone, using a huge font-size, to aid my terrible eye-sight. Plus pure laziness.) My folk's 28 pound cat is afraid of the Chihuahuas whenever they come over. Oh yeah, how is Cappuccino?! I nearly forgot! His picture on the Litter Box is so cute! ^Also known as Pocket Pets. ;) Cappuccino is floppy-eared at his age, so people don't always realize he's a Chihuahua. Chihuahua - everyone has an image in their mind. Nervous, but loyal company , with a bit of fuss. I'm going to have to post a photo on the website. He's the best chick magnet ever. Too bad I can't take better advantage of that at my age. My group would be offended if I didn't use the NSFW deck. I'm hoping the NSFW will come as a separate deck. I like keeping the two completely separate so I can choose the one that's most appropriate for the group I'm gaming with. Sweet, CB. I have an aunt and uncle who currently have 4 Chihuahuas The drinking that comes from being Irish. THAT can be disorienting. All, I have a new cub of my own: Cappuccino, a Chihuahua, born June 10 of this year. From the numbers, looks like most pledgers are automatically opting for the dual decks, one regular, one NSFW Edition expansion - which we all suspect might get upgraded to a stand-alone, if the campaign seems popular enough. ;) Being Irish is disorienting? Good thing I'm only 1/3 Irish (or whatever my dad's adoptive father being full irish makes me); I only have mild vertigo. So is being Irish. Cha!! I forgot about how essential DJ Cha! was! Dang, that ! is always disorienting. @Kevin, Porthole Cleaner it is. Welcome aboard. In the meantime, we need to complete Chameleon's parody of the lyrics to our anthem: In the town where I was born Lived a man who sailed to sea And he told us of his life In the land of submarines So we sailed up to the sun Till we found the sea of green And we lived beneath the waves In our yellow submarine ` No clue what to change these to in order to connote bears and cubs living in a submarine. Where's Cha! To drop us some tunes?! <url>"Coctail Cub" part. If you can get her to agree with you for "Cocktail Guzzler First Class" I'll be glad to change it. Drunken sailor does work for me too Pimp? Drunken Sailor would work well, though. We also need to find Cub titles as well as Alternate Superbacker Titles. That title for her doesn't sound right though. Did she ever see my suggestion of "Cocktail Guzzler First Class"? Rummy? @Trinkets, Geist got there before you. www.cubsubcorps.com mind = blown ` Don't say I never learned anything in math. Or did they miss me, zem? Trinkets, Drunken Sailor? Just putting this back up here: <url>` Those two are great places to find a nautical job title. ` And don't forget, "Yeoman of the Sheets", "Yeoman of the 'Powder Room'", and "Wiper" are all perfectly available titles. ;) Ok, what would you call a ships resident drunkard? @Trinkets ... with sequins! Hey, the big entrance and everything! Although you missed when all the people were around. ;) Flannel ambidextrous pouch! Speaking of trinkets ... Will this come with a lanyard or pouch so we don't lose it? Good question, CB. I'll get back to you. @Trinkets! What's your crew assignment? *trumpets, fanfare, joyous celebrations* Let it be known..........I am here!! ^Scratch that - I'm clueless. ^><^ Each monster is leveled per card that makes it up, so a monster made of 3 cards can take out 3 babies, but any more will kill it. I don't know if two monsters compound, though, but Elan did say something about 4 classes that kill babies of the same type. We'll see all the details later on when they're worked out and we're going to be getting the cards, so don't worry too much. ` As for the provocation question, that's the most asked, and also with no details because so far this is just a campaign, we're not actually playing yet. I would guess there's a duel between the two people who survived, though. Maybe the decks are kept seperate, with cards drawn from each and given to each player? Dunno. A few rules questions that are unclear - when you fight the babies, do you count all the cards you have, or is it per monster? So if you have two monsters, one with 4 cards and one with 2, and you fight 3 babies, do the babies defeat your 2 card monster and lose to your 4 card monster? Or is it considered that you have 6 cards and just win? Also, when you provoke the babies to try to knock out some of your opponents cards, what happens if some of your opponents have more cards than babies? Clearly they don't lose, but who keeps the baby cards for the points? And what happens in a tie (same number of baby and monster cards in a hand). Asking the important questions here, people. Kevin, yeah, though you can just go to manage your pledge and change it, so I don't know. Some people must just be weird and not somehow want the amazingness that will be this game and community! Well, it's really only 9 hours so far, but I guess in their time zone it's midnight? No, but something like that? Or just 29 days exactly from the end. Rescinding to Resend? Maybe. :) I watched the numbers up top for awhile and twice they went down! Who's rescinding their pledge?! They'd better be doing it so that they can repledge at a higher level! First day down 29 Days : 23 hours : and somethingthingminutesandseconds to go. :P Not bad for the warm-up lap, but Just Keep Swimming...Just...yeah. :) Tomorrow? Aaw, I'm getting it Friday! Who cares, soon enough! I really can't wait! Between this and getting the "imploding kittens" expansion tomorrow... MLIA! Dang it, missed a perfect opportunity for a Rick Roll yet again! Kevin, ever seen Super Troopers? <url>"ight in the Attic' , called 'Someone Ate the Baby' Here's the author reading it: <url>` Also, Phil, the hot sauce creator is Lord Zombitten, who was the third comment on here, but hasn't been on since even though he's one of the regulars. Good to know so before I launch my campaign I will have to change my name or be stuck with it always saying Josh "Panda Cub" I am voting for Bartender OK everybody, which do y'all want, "Coctail Cub Bartender" or "Coctail Guzzler First Class?" Ya your the hot sauce creater Owen talks about. But yeah, I think titling Geist "Cocktail Guzzler First Class" works great! @Zem, it's because I'm a creator, and KS is afraid I'll confuse my backers if I change it. ya just ask me to retype it better. sometime I will then review what I am trying to say. CB, was it that now since you had a campaign, you can't change your name? Or that you don't want to change your account name, but wish you could keep it Cheetah Butt in the comments? Sheetah Butt? What wickedness lies within my keyboard tonight? Phil, so long as you're coherent, just with poor grammar or spelling, we can understand just fine. It's just when the grammar muddles the point of the sentence. Stupid english and its strict word order rules make it tougher to understand through mistakes than some languages. btw, I can go by CB (Sheetah Butt) or CC (Cheetah Cub) but KickStarter won't let me change my name in the comments. ya sometimes I will just type O Ooh, Geist, CB, how about Cocktail Guzzler First Class? Ya you will get use to my typing. GM always points it out to me. I have a habit of not review before I hit the post button. And since you know him outside of the comments, if you call him Owen, we'll know and it'll probably be less weird for you to type. @Geist, you got it. Check out www.cubsubcorps.com and tell me if I got it right. Heehee, it's just funny to me because I chat with a bunch of people learning English, and your comments sound so much like them! chat GM talks about me in EK Talk all the time. An ya i suck at typing Phil, your grammar is needing nap Zem we are hit 800 comments before EU comes in ^@Micah Yes, I know - I was there for most of the banter during the EK campaign. Love everyones enthusiasm. ^.` Phil... uh, put down the hard whiskey and rethink whatever you just said. I couldn't quite understand that. @CB: ok. As long as I can keep cocktail cub @Geist, how about Bartender? I'm a bit uncomfortable with anyone out-ranking Cap'n Lee. ya I am waiting mostly for me. as I as a sub text in the EK chat That's the European Crowd: The Night Cubs. ` Let's go cubbing! Kevin, you can just comment a few times, but if you're active with the community, then we're accepting with open arms! Don't worry about it! well the Night cub could be the life of the party on the Cub Sub :-) @CB: may I change my name to Admiral Cocktail Cub? lol Night cubs Night cubs. Man, that feels weird to type I'm too settled to promote much excitement or chatte. If I were to join the CubSubs, I would wind up just being "The Body" , which is kind of morbid and I don't think fits that well with the theme. :) Josh, The Heavy grabbing the Sandvich out of the fridge. CB, give up. Not even to sleep can you leave! If you read the campaign page, you'll miss 30 comments like I did when I went to grab food! and for a pic of the sanvich cub you could use a picture of the Heavy from TF2 Haha, Kicktraq says trending to 20 million now! Imagine if we could keep that kind of steam up! Someone should be the Sanvich cub :-) and their title could be Sub Sandvich Chef I hope I get time to actually read the campaign page before the end of the funding period. I don't want to fall behind in the comments again. Also armory. See my links below to pick some good armory crew titles. Even just a Torpedo Officer or something. Gunners, Gunsmiths, or even the Yeoman of the "Powder Room". ya a armory crew Sorry, wrong button, we're missing the SUB SANDWICH MAKER!!! Eh, it's a submarine. We can have something simple, like canned food. But really, there's one thing we're missing: Excited! Not going to mess with @Cub-Cake (Creeper). SHE can make my lie miserable if I cross HER. lol you need a place for your crew mates to eat right okay I'll be the Sous Chef but you should add Creeper as suggested and make him the Pastry Chef just to see his response later on when he checks the site "Damn it, Jim. This is a submarine, not a restaurant!" I think having a Sous Chef is more important than having a Pastry Chef. No, no, make him the Desert chef! I want to see how he pulls that off! Lots of sand, I imagine, though salt flats are another common desert. okay ill be the Pastry Chef because as a Panda I like sweet tasty stuff A Sous Chef is second in line to the Master Chef, kind of like an Assistant Manager in the kitchen. You're confusing him with Pastry Chef. Creeper is the dessert chef for sure! But yeah, you can make deserts, Josh. ;) Josh if you want to be desert you want to be a pastry chef Pastry Chef makes deserts. :) Sous Chef is 2nd under Head Chef. Woo! Can't wait till Imploding Kittens, the expansion pack, gets here friday! second hand to a chef yea that works :-) The Sous Chef makes deserts right ? @Panda Cub, how about Sous Chef? Change Cub Cake to Master Chef and make me Chef, I don't mind working under a female leader :-) Later, Cub-Cake Ok cubbies- done with work break. Back at it again. @kabala- TA lol I decorate the torpedos? @Cub-Cake, done. Yeah, but not all of these do. Maybe Torpedo Decoration Director. @Micah, That's sort of why I said Cruise Director. They're in charge of all the fun stuff. :) @Micah, Sure, why not Ya but it doesn't match the sub theme. Nah, not as fun. You need to be like Cruise Creative Director or something! Chameleon, along the lines of Cruise Director, on the first site I linked down there, see Chief Steward. Is that good? Oh yeah, "Wiper" is a great title for anyone! ;) @kabala- *ahem* chef Chameleon, keep in mind titles from Gilligan's Island are PERFECTLY acceptable. Have fun with those. ;) ` AAH! Return of the incessant ;)! It's a habit! Hola, Creeper! And that's perfect, that can be your Cub title! Many of us aren't changing our actual KS names, though, so don't worry about that. Ooh, I'll put "Mate for anyone without a formal assignment yet. I could be the Cruise Director. This IS a cruise, right? Am I on the right boat? Hey, @Creeper, check out www.cubsubcorps.com Just putting them there for tomorrow when some people come on and want some titles. ` Just a note, some great options are "Yeoman of the Sheets" or "Yeoman of the Powder Room". ;) Or even just "Mate". @CB, I don't knowwwww! :( @Chameleon, what should your crew assignment be? I swear if someone already took "cub-cake" <url>` Those two are great places to find a nautical job title. If we add to the Anthem, I'll probably show the full lyrics somewhere below the picture so that it doesn't go below the actual image. Lyrics to the full, original song if anyone want to take a stab at re-writing more of it: <url>#q=yellow%20submarine%20lyrics @Zem, makes sense. We'll have to finish the rest of the song, Chameleon. Make it a full cover. The Berth is the shelf-like sleeping quarters, or basically the beds on a ship. (my name is The Mattress) @CB, On the website, should be some space between the 1st and 2nd verse of the "anthem", or whatever it is. It's just a part of the Yellow Submarine song, actually (modified slightly). :) What's a "Berth?" Oh, and our Cub titles! Like Hibernating or Panda or Polar. We'll have to get those from people tomorrow as well. Ooh, I like that! Oatmeal as First Mate. Other than that, it looks awesome, and you're really amazing, CB! Thanks so much for getting that set up so nicely! Me, the Berth. Also, we'll have to put up our own personal Alternate Superbacker title after it, we could pick those tomorrow. Also he should put Oatmeal as First mate ya that works you still have no idea for Elizabeth position Anymore, I'm guessing since what's left will be overnight and the first-day blow up is ending, I'm going to say 850K-1mil. Everyone please look at the crew list and see if I got everyone. Notify me if I missed someone or got someone's crew assignment wrong. Thanks. (It's just below the yellow sub. You may have to scroll.) ya earlier we were guessing what the one day pledge total would be. I am thinking 1.2mil by the end of day Wish there was early bird pricing for the first 20,000 backers. I would have scraped in :) Damn this grew quickly. ya I probably will post a lot when I am bored I stopped gaming a year ago and netflix is just a pacifier when I am really bored and have the day off. It's just over septupled since I joined. The challenge is trying to balance commenting like hell and not seeming like a spammer! I've spent a long time trying to find the line, and I think I'm walking on it. Walking on a thin line Straight off the front line Labeled as freaks, loose on the streets of the city Phil, that I can totally respect and actually envy. But for people who just leave and sit at a computer or watching netflix with their phone, they could at least say hi later on. Everyone just leaves though. I try to check in every time I get a chance, which is why I've been such a prominent commenter since the first campaign. Also I nearly have the most comments on that campaign and almost certainly have the most here. ^You're right, of course. ^=^ ya GM is that way his free time his gaming the backers have double my backer number and is still going Nah, I've found that people are only on here DURING work, ironically. Not during their free time, only when they're supposed to be doing something productive. North American West-Coaster 9-5ers should be filing out, commuting either physically or vitualily and logging in ...to find... Hey, guys! ;) Thank you! NSFW is an expansion pack, so yes, it'll add to the normal deck (though hopefully later also become its own full deck). No clue how many per deck yet, but probably about the same as EK. They'll send an update eventually with all of this. Yeah, CB, you're awesome for setting up the sites and maintaining them all the time! Any idea how many players for one deck and if the NSFW deck can be combined with the normal deck to increase number of players? Thanks! This game calls to me I adore the website!!!! You guys are awesome!!! :) Woo! Wait, CB, that's not the picture with Elan in the Captain's spot. You should get that picture on it! nice Website us up. <url>#AlternateSuperbackerTags @Micah - Liz or HC ... easier to type xx @Elan Lee - You didn't really answer my question. The video does state that the babies attack all creatures. But what happens if there are 2 babies and multiple players have creatures at 3 strength or higher? Who gets to eat the babies? Babybacker. :) My 9th as well, ... Liz? Hib? HC? Either way, yeah, that deserves some kind of title! Even InferiorBacker. This is my 9th project that I backed. I'm a 'Tinybacker' #AlternateSuperbackerNames Uber-backer! lol Haha, Chameleon, you can't be talking! You're an Uber-backer! @William It's not just a total number of projects. It's based on number of projects over a certain period of time (i.e., frequency of backing). I don't know the specific numbers, though. @Micah - Sounds like so much fun. I am happy to be a small part of it! Will, I've wondered the same thing for awhile! Just looked it up and it's 25 projects with at least $10 in the past year, though I know people get it with less than that. @William O, I thought it might be 100, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's less. How many times do you have to back projects to become a SUPER BACKER? This campaign will be amazing because it'll be just like the original campaign, but now everyone from the corps to the EK team are all prepared and have foundations for doing the campaign, so now we can build everything off previous experience with a bigger group and more ideas! @CC - I bookmarked that page. I can't wait for some content to generate there :]] Cool @Chameleon, already have the Anthem, but thanks. Which will be here, but there isn't anything there yet: www.cubsubcorps.com You know, now that the Cub Sub Corps is here, the Cubs HAVE to win the World Series! Thanks @PC xx @HC Yes a website is on the way. @mike - Will there be a website? I would ask you to link me but if I need to get some sleep, I might miss your reply in all the new comments LOL I call not sleeping on me! And I'm the only person who can definitively say I will never sleep on me due to the laws of physics and topography. @CP: I second the not it motion! Ooh, we're going to have to be careful; previous heroes and villains are all joining together! There might be some spats! @micah - Sleep is good zzzz Micah Berth Bear For sleeping on Micah - Not it! And now I changed my title so it's spelled correctly. Told you I need sleep hahaha But I'm not changing my name ever because it's so great for me. That's my name for sure, but those are my titles. For the record, I'm the Polar Bear, and my title is Berth since I'm a Mattress, so I'm the bed. @Josh - I will have to read that. I have an autistic teenager and a husband so I like to hibernate every chance I get! @CB, Oh, going by what's in the deck of cards? Then yeah, pretty much anything is open. lol Oh God, 30 comments! Well, I expected nothing less! Good job! Oh God, I'm going to have to sleep tonight... so many missed! And even worse, all my classes are in the morning my time, when the most people are on! @CB, There's this, too: We all live in a rainbow Cub Sub Rainbow Cub Sub, rainbow Cub Sub We all live in a rainbow Cub Sub Rainbow Cub Sub, rainbow Cub Sub And our friends are all on board Many more of them live next door And the band begins to play Excellent @Bruce P. I have now changed my name so it's mine :] The shark can be our scout aka Look out :-) @Chameleon, it's not limited to bears though. I definitely see a shark head in the deck. hey we need to give Zem his 3 pages @Elizabeth, Sort of, yep. :) That's where I "borrowed" the song from, too. lol I googled longest bear hibernation and found this <url>"cub" name. Supposed to be bear cubs because of Bears vs Babies. ;) But hey, all are welcome aboard the Sub. @Bruce P - Thanks for the warning! @Sally I'll be a stow away then, I mean its not like the sub is a cruse ship :-) Ya I think I am going for Tiger cub @Elizabeth, Having to reinstall Neverwinter, just so you know. Still couldn't start the game and I've read reinstalling it has worked for some people. I'm back and I want a nickname. What'll it be?? At least, when not on active duty. Or when on free time. @Josh Sounds like a first class passenger to me :) @PC: Wouldn't that just be Sailor Panda? ;) I am thinking either grizzly cub or tiger cub I haven't decided yet I've got dibs on Cheetah Cub! CC hmm which title would be good for the panda cub ? he likes to eat a lot and sleep around and thoroughly annoy the staff when they try to clean up his play pen Now I'm going to leave to get some food. When I come back, I don't want 3 pages to read, alright? I mean, it is slowing down in here and I'm half the comments most of the time, but still. @Phil: Actually...in the oilfield business, it picks up in the winter. But we have also let everyone know that only when we someone is going to be over paid do we do any changes. If it's underpayment, they get to wait for either an off-cycle, or the following payroll. Knock on wood because if I have heard from the past something will be thrown in last minute but again things are slowing down with winter coming As Mattress, I'm the Berth, the bed/sleeping accomodation. @Geist: We could call you Admiral Cocktail Cat @Phil: It won't be provoked. The only people who need to look at it from here on out are: my manager, the terminal managers, HR manager, and accounting manager. I have VERY rarely seen any changes come back once I hit this point. Oh yeah, Geist is definitely the cat. So we need to get this all officiated on the site. CB is the Chief Engineer, Creeper is Chief Cook, GM is the Purser... what else was there? @GM: I already have a cat thankyouverymuch. ;-P Oh, AT, it's going slower, but I think it should be more massive at the end. Oh GM that Payroll is your baby just make sure it isnt provoked @Aether Tower, I'm not sure of the exact minutes, but I think it was less than 40 Ooh... tempting. I might be the cat. What maritime job are polar bears good at? Breaking the ice? *badum-tss* triple entendres for the win! This project is going to break the previous records of Exploding Kittens, this will be exciting. Does anyone know how many minutes it took to get this project funded? @Sally: I think Geist may be pulling double duty with that one. ;) Sally, THANK YOU! GM, you're the Purser! And who gets to be Ship's Cat? ;) Isn't that the Purser? @CP: I'm not on vacation...I'm supposed to be on my busiest day of the week...considering it's the larger payroll this week, yet I am done almost everything....and it's not even the end of the day yet. Heeheehee! Who wants to be the "Wiper"?! GM, I can't find any special titles for maritime payroll coordinators. Maybe you could find one, but maybe you can be the Bursar or something like that. @Micah, Helps that I'm also on vacation. lol Lots of time to waste on fun things. :) @GM, Controller Cub, 1st Class. :) Did you catch Chameleon's first logo? That'll do nicely until Oats makes our day. And the Anthem! Chameleon, you're on fire today! I may have accidentally originated the name, but you took it and ran all the way to the goal! Not sure what I can be...something about pay control. I'll be Admiral Cocktail Guzzler I hope we can get The Oatmeal to draw us another corps logo. I've already screen-scraped the anthem to put it on the site. @Kevin: We're all certifiably insane, and then certified in other areas as well. Trying a re-install of Neverwinter. Boo! ...but visitation hours are fairly open and all may seek asylum, errr respite, here. :^) HA, we formed the Cub Sub-corps, Cub Sub for short, leading to all sorts of bear and submarine/mariner puns. Heehee, looking at some shipmate titles, there are some good options! Some that can be double-ententes! "Yeoman of the sheets" "Yeoman of the powder room" We definitely have a Chief Cook, Creeper. Sub sub-corps? Many of us are certified. In what exactly, is a bit of a secret, but trust us, we have credentials. @HA, ya you! ;) Howdy, HA! ` Or should I say Ahoy! We are a Sub sub-Corps now. Me! House Arrest!!! I vote CB is Chief Engineer since he's really the engineer behind the KC! @sean just you wait @Sploc, what up? Oh gosh, in addition to picking a bear cub, we'll need a ship crew title! ` Sean Gilbert, you have NO clue! @Sally, nope, just the smart ass... ;) You guys seem like fun people. This is day 1 (one)? Yeah, this might work out OK. ;) Bah, Neverwinter on the PS4 still can't start. :( Aye aye @BaKhan (does that make you the bosun?) Woo! CB, have them and KC cross-linked with eachother for ease of access once the site gets set up! Hey, I just thought, we should have a BvB Top Commenter leaderboard as well! PS, I'm well under 300 comments from finally passing Creeper! www.cubsubcorps.com is now registered ... also cubsubcorp.com because I fat fingered it the first time. I'll probably point them both to the same site though so people can choose whichever they like. Ugh why hasn't this game beaten exploding kittens total yet? :P And by "enjoy the day" he means have a drink. (Ok, he didn't mean that but it is still a good idea) @Sally, I believe we're going with Cap'n Lee... ;) Haha, couldn't Max just email Elan or Oats to ask about that? ;) Bahaha, love the Cub Sub w/ Captain Lee. Geist, wait, THAT Max Temkin? I thought the name was familiar! Man, I've so regretted not having the money to get Secret Hitler; I still really want to play that! Hmmmmm... thinking about the old campaign, will we have another Sklorz Goltovka sighting? hehe, that'd be funny! *waves at Max* Love Secret Hitler. Fun to play once people got over the shock of the name. The Kitten Cub Club! Heehee. The Bear Cub Sub-Kitten Corps Club. But yeah, the Cub Sub is a sub-corps to the KC. So that makes categorization easier as we just make a new branch on the old website and maybe a new file on the same forum. Announcement: I'm not announcing nothing! See, nothing! When are you going to announce stretch goals Geist, how about ghost of the dead bear? Can cubs become vampires? @CP, you're a chameleon, they'd never see you comin'! I mean, I'm not changing my name, I'll just be represented in the Sub as a Polar bear cub. @Elan: We're actually working on getting a Sub-Corp going, the Kitten Corp will always be the original, but then we need a Sub-Corp for people who joined us later. Can leezards be cubs? I am not coughing up my screen name. I like it too much. Nope, I'm taking Polar Cub anyways! Suck it, Canadians! I'd take Polar cub, but I'd imagine the Canadians are more fitted to that. @CP: Nice! @Panda Cub: I can keep mine, bears love mountains. :P @Josh, trust me bears love bacon! Sure we can. :) @CP, can we call him Cap'n? We all need new Cub names :-) Cub Sub with Captain Lee: <url>"185 newer comments" 8-O Yeah, I won't worry about game mechanics until the game is released. UK here too! GM, one of the requisites for being in the Corps or Sub is to vow no question goes unanswered and in the middle of goofing off or procrastinating on here, answering the question and then flooding the question down into oblivion by goofing off again. @Elan, Cub Sub-Corp (Cub Sub for short). :) Wait, will the babies come in bbq flavor? @CP I call dibs on the Panda cub in the sub :-) @Elan: I noticed that there were no signed editions. Learned your lesson from last time? (As much as I love the game, I'm not going to pay $800 for it on Ebay) @Elan: Based on that, as long as one player totals more than the babies, they get all the babies? Or just one? @Elan: The ol' Corp is here to assist as we did last time(pretty sure everyone is onboard with that. Right? Good, even if you said no. :P) GM as you guys call him @Elan Hi Elan I cant wait to read the first official update :-) Hey Elan. I think I'll make you Captain of the Cub Sub. ;) <url>"road" there! Not too bad, just a dirt path, though. So when you wake the babies, they attack everyone at the table at once? What happens when multiple players have creatures more powerful than the babies? Who gets to eat the babies? Right?! I jumped on this one a lot quicker since I saw the facebook post and I have push alerts on for all of these guys on twitter. So that helped. I can't tell which backer number I am Really Cal? Crazy! I think I was 2,419! I would have been lower had I known about it, but I didn't come until Geist tipped us off on the EK side. @CP: OMG YES! @Zem: Thought we agreed on sand earlier? You did suggest a desert for our next meet-up that you would likely attend. All aboard the Cub Sub! <url>` But in the original EK, Elizabeth, we had people in America on for the whole day, but even when it was night for the majority of backers, there were so many Europeans, Russians, and elsewise Asians that we had a 24/7 streak for virtually the entire campaign! Let's keep it up; I need someone to chat midlessly to at 4 am on weekends! @Rod - Missed that then. It was my husband that backed EK. And technically, they're ours for the next two years muahahaha @GM, good luck catching up again! ;) Okay...I need to restart my comp. The ribbon in excel isn't showing up for the last three spreadsheets I've opened. @Elizabeth, sorry, its a leftover from EK... ;) How many Europeans do you need? I'm old, but Liz sounds like an owl :) Hey, no Brexit here! @Rod - Don't get me started on that >.< Hahaha, BaKhan! @Elizabeth, does that make you EU-unfriendly then? >.> I am in the UK :] Sem, my near name doppleganger, Elan said Kickstarter added a new server, possibly for this, so we may only very strain the internet. We're going to have to try extra hard now to break it completely again! Kill the internet! Spam all the forums and media outlets! Back to the good 'ol EK KS Comment rate where I can't leave this tab to see a video or go eat food, otherwise I'll have a full page to catch up on! Ooh, will we revive the European Corps so I can talk to people all night again, literally 24/7 comments on here again? OOH! Riddle "Hour" pt. II someday at like midnight to 6 or 7 am (central time) again! @Micah - Duh. And boobs. Is it even possible to break the internet twice? @GM, lol! Heh, I wonder if one of the NSFW cards will be dick-fingers? Ooh! Salad Fingers! They need a Salad Fingers card! Just one with a slightly used diaper. Any possibility of adding a pledge reward that includes exploding kittens? lol #3628, I was adulating, and procrastinating...multitasking those is a fun challenge. Yeah, that's true. But that's Russia. They were EU-friendly, but not Russia-friendly. The russian judge gave them a 1. That whole situation was really stupid. Hope they figure it out this time! #7702, I feel ashamed, but I was adulting, what could I do!?! So far, other than Dan with 893, I'm winning with 2,419! Woot! Though I imagine since Geist was the one to tip us all off to this, she's much lower. @Zem: Well, perfect delivery outside of how Russia stopped a bunch of the packages at the border and they went poof. Well done @Phillip! Backer 8062 not bad for waking up to after getting a text EK got another game out GM, OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH! @GM, ooooh burn! ;) Josh, I think so, if only because it has the loyal support and backing of original EK backers, but with added media coverage throughout the campaign and now EK is a widely known and respected game, and the team has a great reputation after delivering perfectly on the first campaign, so it should bring in plenty of new people and ones who missed the original as well! @Josh: I think it has more of a chance than FC had. ;) so the 1,000,000 dollar question is will this game surpass EK in terms of total pledges and number of backers ?? Hmm, who's in the 301+ club? ;) I was 127015 on EK because, while I was there from the first seconds of the campaign, I had never done KS before and didn't really finally cave in and back it for a long time. Didn't even discover comments until the day before the Draw event! too @Josh; ah that's to bad the game is 10k+ only.... I have to watch Westworld when my daughter and husband are done hogging the TV watching Archer. Although, they have given me time to be active here while I wait for my turn .... Don't know how I managed to be backer 893... This is insane! Missed out on Exploding Kittens, so wanted to make sure I backed as soon as I found out about this... Didn't bother to read the info, just backed straight away! Woot I am backer # 9,883 so i can proudly say that I am apart of the 10k and under club With the NSFW deck can this be played with 5-6? @owen Ya well when I was in vegas I put them with my luggage but I still have 5hrs to wonder the strip at 110f when I was there Hey Night1505!!! Backing another cardgame ey? #AlternateSuperbackerTags @Night: I still have two spreadsheets to balance...that I've been working on for 2.5-3+ hours. >.> Sub 2500 even!! We need stretch goals! Superslacker Spends way too much time at work in the KS comments chatting @Micah - Yea! Sub 3000 for the win x Dang... gotta meeting to go to... stupid work :'( @Phil: Hey, last time there were no problems with the chocolate. Plus, it was stored inside whenever we had some. This time, even stored inside, with outside being just 1C, it's melting...on my desk, with my fan blowing towards it. Backer 2,419! Supergamer - only backs game campaigns. #AlternateSuperbackerTags SuperCracker - Will only back projects if their pledge will push the total over the goal. Obsessed with claiming such feats in the comments. #AlternateSuperbackerTags Studebaker You are a car #alternatesuperbackertags So about 98 F? Most chocolate melts at just barely under body temperature, and I'd really hate to work in around 98 degrees! LOL @BaKhan @owen be happy those chocolate didn't melt before they even got into your hands. As vegas was really hot. @owen - I was backer number 5303. I consider that a win considering what this will probably end up at ;] Oh this is going to be fun! @Zem: Go to backed projects, and click on this one, your number is near the bottom of the window that comes up Superscammer, one who backs many projects for $1 just to get a lame lable... ;) #AlternateSuperbackerTags SuperMaker - Only backs 3D printers. Also, creates campaigns for custom miniatures! #AlternateSuperbackerTags @Zem: The thermostat for my office controls this entire side of our floor. I work on the side with three women who get cold easy, and are 50+. Is there a way to see your backer number? We should compare! I was just over 2,700, I believe. Yeah, Josh, I leave for 30 seconds and have 8 to read! @Elizabeth: It's quadrupled-ish since I backed this. What the heck, GM? How hot is it in there?! Do you work in a sauna now? Actually, that sounds nice. You're so lucky, GM! ah the days of EK live again. I just came back and now i have 44 new comments to read through SuperFakir - Gets all Kickstarter funds from friends and relatives. Sings praises of Kickstarting and seeks to enlighten fellow backers! #AlternateSuperbackerTags @Creeper, good to see you! Elizabeth, I pledged somewhere around 2,700, so it's nearly quintupled since I did! @Creeper: HI CREEPER! Don't stab anyone. We can't handle it if you did that without a proper escape plan. Also...IT"S TOO DAMNED HOT IN MY OFFICE! My chocolate is melting. @Night, I like it, more like this! ;) Congrats guys!!! Hello all my dear ones! I've been super busy but thinking of you! Will chat soon! Gotta get back to work. Hmmm... other tags for Superbacker... SuperBaker - Master of pastries, pies, and truthful cakes! Almost tripled in backers since I pledged :]]] @Creeper, Well hello to you! :) Also, still no word on the ambidexterity or plaidness of the sleeves, nor the EU friendlyness. I'm in the bathroom at work. Hahahah... I'm on a 14 hour shift, so I won't be able to keep up today. Happy reunion all! @Creeper, not only EU friendly, but sns, ambidexterous, and comes in plaid! Creeper, you made it! I was beginning to wonder where you were! CREEPER!!! Nice to see you again, Calc! Make sure to check back in! Hola! Is shipping EU friendly? And with that I go to sleep... keep the fire burning! @Phil, fair enough, I think we're planning a Europe tour in a few years, gonna take a while to make up for this year... Calc! Good to see you again! @Stuart, this is because obviously you have exceptional taste! Haha, 11,000 backers are returning and only 1,500 are first-time! I bet that's because of the EK holdover! @rod ok fair but it is more like hmmm europe for 30 days for a great birthday Hello BaKhan! Good times memories! Yyaasssss! Loved Exploding Kittens so much! So excited for this game now! Hi GM! Good to see you too! @GC, good to see you! @Phil, it doesn't work the other way... that just makes you feel worse, its more like, "wait, I swear I just had some money..." OMG! IT'S THE GENERAL! HI GENERAL CALC! ya rod, unless you are like me and just making it through life @Geist, No worries. Go eat some poutine for me! :) Nice to see the old gang rambling on here as well.... *waves* :-) @Geist, just wait till you exchange your money, you'll be all like "I'm rich, rich I tell you!" Geist, I'd much rather go to Canada than be on here the whole time, so consider yourself so lucky! Bryan, I'm certain that's why they don't have them yet. They need to see what scale we're shooting for so they can make the goals just above that. I hope they do them like last time in the game format! @Prime: stupid new job is keeping me hella busy otherwise I'd hang out with you folks. Price is have to pay to be able to fund a trip to Canada @Bryan, thats a lot of happy strech goals... ;) I'm saying 4.2 million because 42. Hey, that also goes along with my name! My whole life is centered around the Hitchhiker's Guide. Must have blown through at least 25 stretch goals already @BaKhan, No, best left in the past. :) @Phil: My bet is on 2.1m. My calculations say 2.6-3.9m @CP, yep, probably best not to bring it up though... I am still leaving my bet or the day at 1.2mil even if Owen is saying it should be 2.6mil by the end of 24 hours @Micah, That would be fun. :) @Josh, who knows? Once the word really starts getting out there... look out! @BaKhan, Oh no, El Paso. Now THERE'S a story! we will likely hit 1 million in about 2 or 3 hours :-) @CP, not that one time in El Paso though... ;) I wish you could change the superbacker to one of several things like that. Just so that people know, but you can make a joke with it. SuperMattress! Best mattresses on sale! We've got memory foam, air, water, any size you want! Now some are on sale buy one get one free! These big chameleon eyes see all the things! (most of the time) @Night1505 I am pretty sure that their first kickstarter was also set at 10k for the minimum funding goal and yes this will mess with the kicktracker quite a bit Dang, I was hoping you'd miss it entirely, Chameleon! @CP, I saw you not seeing that... ;P @Bruce P - Fab! Thanks friend :] Did you set the goal at $10K just to screw with KickTraq's quarterly metrics? LOL XD @Micah, See, I nearly missed that. "-" is going to get missed. ;) I'd like to see it changed to Superwastrel, or Superbroke... something like that! ;) @Elizabeth, Cool. If you want to add me on there, I'm GrumpGeezer. That goes for any other PS4 peeps. - ah, I think it should be fine! @Bruce P - Me too! @Micah, I think, perhaps, I will miss those comments addressed to me since there are many Superbackers, and "-" is so small. lol superbacker might get more answers then you want Okay, Chameleon, then how about if I try a new one? I'll take a different part of your name! How about "-" or "Superbacker"? ;) @Elizabeth, PS4 @GM, Too many feels! @Micah, Different people call me different things on here. I answer to them all. lol @Chris - Well said! @Chris, thats the spirit! Shut Up and Take My Money @Owen - Elan just accepted my friend request on Facebook. I feel like a celebrity now :] @Bruce P - Are you on Xbox or PS4? @CP: FFXIV has so many feels in the main story...SO MANY! I teared up a few times....almost full out cried at one part. @Elizabeth, Yeah, apparently there was an issue after updating. I'm not sure if it's fixed yet. I was giving it a couple of hours... @Elizabeth: That's what we're known for. And for driving people crazy who don't like all the chatter in a comment section. Though, last time we answered backer questions whenever they popped up because we almost always had a member online checking, and sometimes would see Elan posting. Although, pixel sounds a bit like pee... In several languages, including mine. Now that is just wrong for a Pixel XL. It's iPhone reserved :P Bruce, that's amazing! I wish I had that kind of phone so I could get it! ` By the way, I forget what we finally settled on calling you. I like Chameleon, but Bruce and CP are just as good. @Bruce P - I play Neverwinter but didn't log in today. Sounds like I would have had issues. @Owen - I couldn't stay away. The positivity here is needed in my life!! @Idle/Wild, I have just the phone case for you! <url>… Our lord and savior has visited upon us! Glory! @Chameleon, hey bro! Long time! Is the Sub still afloat? :) It's like sandpaper; your skin will be so silky smooth for years to come! @KC check out hte EK page! Wow, just like old times, I can't leave for fear of having a full page to catch up on! And in the time it takes me to comment, at least one new comment is up! Can't wait till the deluge at the end of the campaign when you just hope someone sees your response! @Zem: What skin after? @Zem, I don't know if I'd go that far... ;) Really good for your skin! @GM, yeah, but exfoliating! ;) GM, no! How would we recognize you? For years we'd all be so confused as to who this strange new mountain was! Mine is also my original one, but will always be. It's one of my favorite pictures! ya I need a avatar one day - me lazy *backers @Zem: We could do that in the desert too...would be more painful. Any other "The Warriors" backer overhere? @Zem, would you settle for white-ish snow? @Elizabeth, good call! ;) BaKhan, yeah, next time we try to meet, it's going to be in a desert because I still have no idea what would happen, only that it involves (hopefully white) snow. I could do with an avatar change...mine if from the very first KS I ever backed. >.> @GM, straight up! I don't care if he comes in the summer and we have to go to the ice fields, its on! ;) I am also getting Kickstarter editions. And now I am getting the NSFW and regular versions of this game to go along with my full set of EK cards! GM, in that case, Shame! *ding* shameless advertising on other campaigns! someone needs to make a bears vs babies avatar that we can use @BaKhan: Until next time. @Zem, you know you're only acting tough cause your safe from that promised facewashing! @Zem: I'm not the one who initially posted about it, this is my first post about it. :P Owen "Great Mountain" Middleton Superbacker 31 minutes ago @Elizabeth: Of course it's friendly. The ol' Kitten Corp is getting back together. ;) So I assumed. And yes, Micah is my assumed name. You've known me for 1 3/4 years and you call me by my assumed name, BaKhan?! You should know better by now! I only respond to Zem! *smack* ;) I'm getting two all black FCs. I just love all black for some reason. @Mary, cause I'm a bad bad KC member, thats why... :( @Elizabeth, honestly, I wasn't that upset about it all. I'm getting two of the KS edition ones, I just like the colors on that one the best. Refuse to use it? Virtually everyone has a FB account, and I only use mine for notifications and messaging some people. Why is it morally evil to use FB for just voting on one thing? I mean, I considered not voting since it wouldn't even make a difference. Rod, what the F*** why on earth would you cal Zem Micah?? What did he do to you to call him that??? @Rod - I respect that. It was a bad move and ruined what was supposed to be a fun aspect. Good thing we now have BEARS VS BABIES!! Ah. That makes sense, though as the Corps well knows, people complain NO MATTER FREAKING WHAT! Tens of thousands (often literally) of complaints no matter what the EK team did last time. We got used to it, though. @Creator. What happens when you provoke a baby and a other player also has more cards on his/her bear just like you? Split the babies ? Since they are eaten, splitting them won,t be that hard... but serious what would happen @Zem, oh snap, I called you Micah! @Micah, the hundreds of fine backers, such as myself, that refuse to use FB. @Micah - The backer designed FC was posted on FB and the whole comment section and update became one big complaint by backers that don't use FB. Oh, just having the voting on Facebook? I thought that was a good idea. What happened negatively off of that? @Owen yup but I consider the last 48 hours to be the ending part of a campaign. Much like a book you have a beginning, middle and end to kick starter campaigns. first 48 hours is the beginning then you have the middle and then the last 48 hours is the end. @Zem, check out the last update, its a doozy! ;) Wait, I didn't keep directly up with FC. What facebook fiasco? @Rod - see my post below ;] @Owen - FC was fun until the 'Facebook Fiasco' (as I will now call it). I need positivity in my life and BvB brings it :]] GM, you're the one someone said advertised the campaign? Shame! *ding* Remember back at the beginning of the FC campaign when they thought they were going to top EK? Ahhh the good ole days! @Creator. What happens when you provoke a baby and a other player also has more cards on his/her bear just like you? Split the babies ? Since they are eaten, splitting them won,t be that hard... but serious what would happen ? I should have "Followed" Elan along time ago so that I would have been notified sooner about this campaign. @Josh: But....FC has 30hours to go still. 10,000 backers! @Zem: Just wait for Elan, or The Oatmeal, to make a cameo...remember the "Draw your comments" period? And how we kept on chatting through it? @josh - Welcome to the party! Plz to include Nutella in baby-food jars with the game when it ships? We need a draw me contest. @Owen: that's too much of a honour, sigh.... EK expansion pack ordered - thanks @Owen xx This is going to be one crazy day watching the end of FC and the start of BB :-) 15 comments in 6 minutes?! Ah, just like the good 'ol days! I came here from the Warriors campaign where some one told me about this game. @Mary: Knowing that you are part of the founding 10k people. :P 10k backers!!! What was the Stretch goal for that one? came here from the Fidget Cube campaign after another backer alerted me to the fact that the Kittens Corps was getting back together :-) 10000 backers in 2 hours :D ya I know I have heard the stories of EK comments @Phil: Lots, lots is going on. And will be every day of this joy ride. @BaKhan: I was actually waiting for someone to comment on EK so I could get it, so yeah only one boo-ya. do I want to know what's going on now? Tin foil caps, get yours here! I shared this on my Facebook. Not that they need any help or anything LOL Yet, looked british to me! Aluminium Oh you are trust me. You have no idea. @Zem, we could test this, Phil, type in aluminium... ;) ya the party is still on my mind, but I also have a major tour planned that I need to fund for in may I can't believe this almost doubled since I backed it. I feel like I am a part of a movement :] Very much more articulate, Phil. So much so that it almost has a british accent! ok let's see if my phone does a better job at typing now because I need to figure out my tablet a little bit better. @GM, just one single Boo-ya? Oh, Hai der. ^.^ @Phil, it would be great if you could come, but I get it, in this economy, work first! Take a couple of suggestions and call me in the morning. A-BOOYA! I got comment 108,000 on the EK page. :P Ya both are their and sorry rod There should be a tier in which you could purchase Bears vs babies AND exploding kittens. Tonight I'm all about Zen autocoreected Yeah, take off autocorrect and put your tablet to bed to get some rest. ...I think being half asleep and autocorrect don't mix. @Phil, I'm going to blame your robbing of me on your drunk phone, this time... >.> For sure not fortune I need to get auto correct off my new tablet Work got real stupid rob, I am hoping that they give me the same style of schedule next week and then I am a fortune coming I went to school with a yami that I emailed all the time @Phil, why u no come to halloween party? :( Yami? Either your phone is drunk or GM definitely woke you up with that text! Stupid auto correct ya not yami Yami those are all valid, but the chance for the last one to have is 1bil : 1 Jonas, at the end, when they send out the surveys, you'll be able to add more decks to your pledge. As of now, though, you can also put in as much money as decks you'll buy, and then on the survey the money will already be there for the extra decks to be ordered. Otherwise, you'll have to pay for them when you submit that survey. @Jonas, just up your pledge by the number of copies that you want. You're sick. Give that million to me. I'm going to throw out some things that can affect the numbers: night, people who check once per day, word of mouth, word of internet, people randomly checking any of the pages showing this campaign, people who happen upon it on its rise in the Kickstarter current projects, people googling "Bears eating babies", and if I win the lottery today and throw in $1 million on my own. howto buy more copies?? I will Zem, I will. Show that salad a thing or two! Give it some love, from the Kitten clan. @owen you and math, but you have to input the down turn on original pledges that have already started in here and which don't look at KS everyday No, I'm rescinding my vote. Too many complications that can arise in 24 hours to boost the numbers or cut them! I'm going to randomly guess... Hmm, no, 42 is a hard number to fit in here somehow. Ah, hell, 4.2 million! 42 is always the answer! Now if you'll excuse me, I need to kill a salad. Too many Greek liquors tested tonight. I've heard if we raise 5 mil today, its free trinkets for all! We need a certain Austrian general to take the bets in a nice table You have to account for online news picking up the story and people telling their friends. ` I'm very tentatively guessing 2 to 2.15 million. Kicktraq says it's trending to 9 million by the end of the campaign! @ GM I just got the BvB FB notice, and it's reading "two hours". @Karhu: If it's been three hours, we're looking at ~$2,600,000 in 24 hours, again, if we stay steady at the same amount per hour My kids and I play EK nearly nightly. Can't wait to tell them about this when I pick them up from school today. No, two, sorry. Also...if my calculations are correct, based on the rate we have gone in these last two hours(and it stays steady at that for the whole 24 hours), we could be at ~$3,900,000 raised. I think the campaign has been running for about three hours now. I can't believe I got in on this at a backer number in the 5000's. This is sure to be as huge as EK. Our family play EK all the time - it's one of our favourite card games. Does anyone else regularly play EK? The number are flying up! Woohoo! So nice to have so much of the old Corps back in, though! I hope we can get most of the old crew in here and maybe even some new faces to bulk up the Sub! So, I would gather, based on the fact we have given $325k already in ~2hours, in the first 24hours, I will wager 2.1mil. In that case, two. It's been up for like 2 hours lol. It'll hit 1mil today I think Let the games begin! Winner gets babies, losers are babies. Sorry, losers :D I am betting 1.2 mill 800k I say. Mil and a half plus tomorrow, EU time. @Idle: Depends on what time this actually launched...I'm not entirely sure, and I can't find that number anywhere. Not quite the massive explosion of the first time, but I imagine this campaign will raise almost as much as EK, if not more. Idle, don't fear, my brother isn't a whale. Though I hope Derpy comes out to play with this campaign! My brother was Sparkypi. How many hours in? Four? Any bets on how much will be raised in day 1? NOOOOOO HE'LL DO IT DON'T JUST DON'T Or it could be a cougar yowl instead. Oh, I got it, the same cat meow, people would lose their minds! muhhaahahahhaa! That sounded dangerous. This game is going to be purrfect for may NSFW Fiends. Come to think of it, there wasn't an explosion. Just a cat. @Idle, I think hes a futon... ;) I think a bear growl is good too. Crying babies not so much. Zem Umm Zen what's your bro's species I got my brother into it like that as well earlier. ` Also, I think the sound will have to be simpler, and in that case, a bear should be perfectly sufficient. Maybe even going out into the wild and recording an actual bear growling! @Geist welcome girl :) BaKhan, you know he'll be playing this either way, he might as well know what he's getting into! I think I woke him up when I messaged him. >.> Geist, NO! No greek professors streaking! ;) @GM, oh no, you got Phil in on this!?! Friends don't let friends.. ah hell, nevermind... ;) yes I am here going back to sleep noe Holy crap! All the old Corps members are coming back. Now all we need is a Prof. F sighting @GM, you know you can hear it now! Wahhh, Grrrrr, smack smack smack, braaap! Come on Phil, I know you're there. Say something! @BaKhan: I think you win the sound contest! Cmon, 200k+ backers! ;) Cmon stretch goals!!! What if it started with the baby crying, then to the bear growling, then smacking its lips and burping? That would be interesting to get that sound. I want a baby growling. Haha, I was thinking a bear growling, but a baby would be funny too! Just to see all your guest players' faces when you open a box and a baby cries! Kinda hoping we don't get a surprise in the box like Exploding Kittens for this one. I don't think I would ever want to open the box if it had a baby crying each time... Yeah, and this time they're ready for the massive tidal wave that is this community and all fun lovers and card-gamers on earth! why isnt there shipping option for costa rica? D: Well, I trusted you guys for Exploding Kittens and was not disappointed, so I guess I'll go out on a limb and trust you with this one too. Well, GM, I pledged instantly, looked through all the comments, and then figured I had time to see the video and read the campaign because it'd be interesting to know what I just lost all my monies to. I just intentionally pledged with the wrong country. Is South Africa the only country the game isn't shipped to? You ship to Swaziland, which is kinda inside South Africa. And Tchotchkes! Are bears and babies left-hand friendly? EU-friendly? Plaid?! @Zem: Wait, you actually looked to see what the game was about? Noob, I pledged because I trust Elan and crew to make a good game. Hey maybe this time we can get some trinkets? Also, you watched the video before pledging? Noob! I pledged at NSFW level, then saw what the project actually was! My wallet thanks me profusely, I'm sure. ;) @GM haha :) off to have a jaegermeisterbie. Siah, what took you so long? I texted you like an hour ago! I feel like if these SGs are going to be anything like what we had to do, someone needs to get on creating a Wikipedia article for BvB. And we're going to need to start compiling selfies with bears (stuffed/taxidermied ones are preferable. Extra points maybe if you're feeding a baby doll to it?) Go go gadget stretch-goals... @Idle/Wild: Beerbies? I think I'll have one when I get home. >.> Bearbies! Bring on the Bears and Babies! While watching the video, I just realized this is the perfect game to tell dead baby jokes over Streeeettttchhhhhh Goooooaaaalllllllsssss =D @Idle/Wild: I haven't remembered that password since I originally created it. Same goes with my KC email. >.> Karhu, it makes salmon fishing MUCH easier! Suit-able @ Bruce Yeah, because bears are clearly known as nature's great boat builders! <url>` Idle, good luck. If I remember right, we had to sacrifice the blood of either a goat, baby, virgin, or virgin baby goat to get a password there! I just never closed it, so I never need to try to reenter it. I have to go . You guys work out the Sub-Corp. Just don't let the boat sink. :) I'm in! Expand the nsfw to a full deck, please! I think I forgot the forum password... The mail one is out of the question @Karhu, That was my first thought (and post about it). Then Micah mentioned Cub Sub-Corp, and Cub Sub had a nice alliteration. :) I kind of like Cub Corps, though. It's a good reference to Kitten Corps in my mind. stop us* @Meow-tair, We all are. Especially me. lol And that didn't stop of from being in the Kitten Corp. ;) @Meow-tair: I'm in the same boat(or would it be a ship now?) as you in regards to that. The Cubs are members of the Cub Sub. Also a baseball team. Final? @Micah, That makes sense. SCCs for the members. :) We're the Cub Sub-corps Sub-corps Cubs. CSS-SCCs. Yeah, let's stick with just the short Cubs! Speak for yourself, CP! I'm fully grown! Past fully grown, as my mother seems to delight in telling me. "Sub-Corp Cub" doesn't even make sense. lol We're cubs (baby bears) in a sub-corp of the Kitten Corp. Cub Sub. I'm just here for the mobile game that will come after. THAT looks like fun! Idle! Great to see you! We've missed you on the old board! I knew this was all just a ploy by Elan to draw out lazy Corps members! The member names are the SCCs, the Sub-Corps Cubs, members of the Cub Sub-Corps. God damn it, here we go again. Hiya Kittens :) The Ursa Majority has spoken... @CP and @Zem: Could always do Sub Cub...not the same ring, but could go with the acronym SCC(Sub-Corp Cub) If a digital game of this is in the works, can one of the stretch goals be codes so that the backers get free digital copies? @Micah, "Cub Sub" has a nice ring to it. Short for Cub Sub-Corp. :) I didn't even watch the vid first... + NSFW . TAKE MY MONIES!!!!!!!!! ya GM, I think your job might need a bit of a stress break once in awhile. Feel free to come here and have your senses spammed every few minutes! ;) Also...ENOUGH DISTRACTING ME! I have a job I'm supposed to be doing. This is a no brainer - husband backed EK and I have now backed BvB. We love you guys and will buy all your games!! Thank you xx Well, that was the fastest back I ever hopped on. You are the best guys! Keep making games!!!! Haha, CP, that's awesome! Is this our new corp's name? The Cub Sub, and that can be our anthem? I'm down for it! @CP: NICE! Now we just need Elan to promote the Cub Sub cadence. Well, this is exciting. :D David, right? I didn't even look at what the project was, I just saw it was Elan's and that the two rewards were the deck and NSFW and threw all my monies in for the NSFW, THEN went back to check what the game was! We all live in a rainbow Cub Sub Rainbow Cub Sub, rainbow Cub Sub We all live in a rainbow Cub Sub Rainbow Cub Sub, rainbow Cub Sub And our friends are all on board Many more of them live next door And the band begins to play @Joshua Martin: Pretty sure it's much higher than that. I clicked on the name at the top of the page twice, one was 5,064, the next was 5,106. And it took ~5 seconds to refresh. Looks awesome This is the first time I have kick started something that I literally didn't care what the reward was. I picked the highest one available and backed it. Lots of trust in these guys. Can't wait to play! Hopefully the SGs start at levels that we already surpassed! If you click on the game's Kickstarter and then click away you can find the average number of new backers this game is getting per second. Looks to be about 3-4 per second, but that is just a rough estimate. @CP: YES! Must ship it NOW! @LZ: That's probably why....I tend to ignore FB. I basically use it to chat with some friends across the globe...or my friend who lives 30min outside the city... last game was the bomb; I look forward to this one as well! Cub Sub! lol I picture baby bears in a submarine. :) Zem, GM, yes it was announced on Facebook yesterday. Hello Micah, and GM, and the other Kitten Corp members! Let's get that SG rolling! The Cub Sub-Corps? @Kyle McCarley they are 1000% funded now, I would say that the chance of a player expansion stretch goal is pretty good if we all express our interest in it. HA! Chameleon! Great to see you guys! I'm hoping this will draw some lost members out of the depths to come say hi again. ;) I couldn't NOT back this when I saw the notification on FB that just said "Bears Vs. Babies" was trending. I clicked on the link, and could not possibly throw 35$ at these guys fast enough. EK was, and still is, a very fun card game. Please let there be a growling box Who's up for a Cub Corp? :) haha oh my old Kitten Corp friends. I'm not surprised to see you here. @HA: Quite likely. We've been keeping it going for a long while now. With Zem's last comment on there, we have reached 107,988 comments. Looks like a lot of fun. The one thing I'd say may be an issue with the "able to play at parties" goal is it's only 2 to 4 players. That's a pretty small party. I am so glad I saw this on facebook by random! We're getting the band back together! lol @GM It's me! I'm good. Dang I've probably missed so much over there So what will this be, the Cub Corp? ;) CP! BUDDY! How many more members are we getting in here?! Huh...backer 3,628 here, back 11,858 on EK. Mmm, delicious, delicious babies! @House Arrest: IT'S YOU! How's it going? Also, the EK comments are still going. :P If this continues at the current rate until the kickstarter ends, it will have around 3.7 million backers, with over 130 million USD raised. Unlikely, but neat. This comments section feels like an awesome EK reunion @LZ: Like Zem said, I didn't hear about this until Geist mentioned it back in the old hangout. I hope one of the stretch goals is a selfie of us with a bear! Yes yes yes! Can't wait to play this one. Ooh, will they make stretch goals into that awesome game like last time? The "100 pictures of this" or so many twitter followers, etc? That was so clever and worked great! *push* is it time for the first stretchgoal(s) yet? :D My body is ready! wow, in under an hour they've reached over 10x their goal! You mean the goal the already beat about 1000% I see they went with the good 'ol $10,000 goal again. I find their lack of faith... disturbing. ::gets ready for stretch goal games:: I'm in! Can't wait!! X Stop taking my monis QQ it looks great but it seems a bit too simple. i would have liked to have some specialty weapons, like an arm that does 2 times the damage on flying babies or a head that make the bear attack 2 times per round or 1.5x the damage ... anyways I'll try it for my self when i get it. Where, LZ? Facebook or something? I didn't see anything until Geist mentioned it. OMG Count me in.... you had me at Bears eating babies. Jessica, no kidding! The instant I heard of this, I shot straight over and threw $35 faster than I thought possible! It was a no-brainer! Zem, there was warning. Yesterday. Elan! Y u no give warning?! I hope some more lost Corps members will peek back out of their shadows for this! Woohoo, another fun game! Can't wait. This was basically a "Shut up and take my money" moment. The NSFW pack is for ages 35+. Guess I'll have to hide that from my sister ... I'm in... Fundicated Like Flynn, I am in. Can we do $5 million? What's up, guys? And funded At this rate it will be funded in the first 20 mins.
