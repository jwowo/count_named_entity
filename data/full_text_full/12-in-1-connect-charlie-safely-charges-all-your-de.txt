CHARLIE is your MVP at work or on the road traveling Sturdy construction, design engineering and compact size makes CHARLIE a powerhouse hero you can’t live without. PLAY OUR STORY Charlie was born out of necessity. While traveling across the United States on business, Adam Badawy and his wife were constantly on the road and frustrated that hotels, airports and most offices were so outdated and limited with plugs. They could never charge all their devices quickly enough. Somewhere between San Francisco and San Diego, CHARLIE was conceived with the idea that an intelligent design can look stylish and functional. Original Concept Sketch in 2014 CHARLIE soon became an obsession. Long nights and many design drafts and the first 3D blue prints started coming to life. The first 3D Image The excitement was building to see how small we can build this powerhouse! Preliminary 3D Expanded Blueprint And then in 2015 the First Prototype was made in White 1st CHARLIE Prototype in early 2015 Continuous Testing 24/7 Though it was beautiful, Adam Badawy wanted it to be smaller and went back to the drawing board and worked closer with engineers to get CHARLIE smaller, lighter and more narrow. Non-Stop Design Meetings with Engineers Another 6 months of constant all-nighters and a few dozen prototypes with different features. Our first prototype was a UNIVERSAL adapter/converter that we hope to introduce Late September-October to our KICKSTARTER backers. For this introductory debut, we opted with the smallest possible design for our domestic North American (US & CANADA) market. That is why we kept working with engineers to get CHARLIE as small as possible. We knew CHARLIE had to be Hand-size and Handsome, if we may so ourselves! More Prototypes in Various Colors Fits in your Palm, Your Purse & Suitcase And then? The breakthrough in technology and design! Aesthetic Design with Intelligent Efficiency Where we are now and what's next After 2 years worth of engineering development and testing we now have a highly functional and performing lab prototype. currently we're working closely with the factory manufacturers to prepare the production setup, and finalize materials and components for the mass manufacturing. Connect CHARLIE is so close to completion and delivery! The manufacturer is finalizing the casting of the Connect CHARLIE high-grade injection mold construction. Now… they are just waiting for the green light to continue. We are also so excited to introduce CHARLIE in these sophisticated colors.
