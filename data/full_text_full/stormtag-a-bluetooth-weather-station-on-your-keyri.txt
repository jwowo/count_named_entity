Our Kickstarter Campaign is Over! Pre-Order StormTag Here. StormTag is the best Bluetooth Weather Station for Android & iOS. Our Kickstarter campaign is over, but you can still get a StormTag. Head over to www.stormtag.co for more info and to place an order. Thanks to our wonderful backers, StormTag will begin shipping in November 2014. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- What if you could be part of a team that changed the way our climate was analysed? We’re plan to perfect crowd sourced weather forecasts, and we need your commitment to help us. And, wouldn’t it be great to carry a weather station on your keyring? Now you can. Not only do you get the best Bluetooth Weather Station for yourself, but your StormTag will contribute meaningful data that is open for scientific analysis. StormTag - waterproof bluetooth weather station StormTag Shares Weather Data to the Cloud Stormtag is set to revolutionise weather data collection, and as our App collects that data we’ll begin to provide you with some weather predictions in real time, even without an internet connection. Basic StormTag Features Barometric Pressure Sensor for weather mapping Temperature sensor 100% waterproof Over 1 year battery life! StormTag+ Features: Barometric Pressure Sensor for weather mapping Temperature sensor Data logging for as long as the battery lasts. Weather data is stored in onboard memory even when your phone or tablet is not connected to StormTag+. More regular syncing will deliver finer grained data. Humidity Sensor: to provide more accurate forecasting and more complete data collection. UV sensor: For skin safety - log your time in the sun. StormTag+ will now know if it is outside and provide even more valuable data. 100% waterproof Over 1 year battery life! Everyone would like to know about local weather. Now You Will! StormTag CR2032 Battery and Size Comparison StormTag will help everybody who has an interest in the weather and climate. It’s water resistant design can attach to your ski jacket, backpack, keyring, boat keys. WeatherSignal App with StormTag Bluetooth Weather Station How does StormTag work and what does it do? StormTag has a temperature and a barometric pressure sensor, it uses Bluetooth LE to communicate this data to iPhones, iPads and compatible Android devices. Weather Map - StormTag collects data worldwide and builds weather maps Imbalances in air pressure cause wind and weather. You’ve seen weather maps on the evening news, those lines on a weather map join together places with the same surface pressure. The shape of the isobars describes the weather pattern, so changes in the weather can be forecast by tracking the changing isobar pattern or by observing pressure change. The tighter the pattern, the stronger the winds. As these patterns move over us the wind direction, precipitation and weather conditions change. For example, a sustained DROP in pressure is a sign of more chance of rain, while a sustained RISE in pressure is a sign of less chance of rain. Of course, since you have a computer in your pocket you won’t need to worry about this, because the WeatherSignal App will monitor and interpret all of the pressure and temperature signals StormTag provides, it can send you alerts for sudden changes. The barometric sensor measures air pressure, this varies with altitude, but we can compensate for this using map and GPS data. StormTag Provides Weather Data - Everywhere - Even With No Internet As you can see in the video above, WeatherSignal already works with the limited number of Android devices that have inbuilt barometric and temperature sensors. StormTag will work with all iOS and Android devices that have Bluetooth LE. For a relatively small outlay, you get a personal weather station! You also contribute all this anonymous data back to our cloud of weather information where it can be accessed by scientists and all other StormTag owners. Inside StormTag - Prototype PCB and battery Please help us build crowdsourced weather forecasts. StormTag is the best Bluetooth Weather Station available I’m using similar electronics found in our YuFu pressure sensitive stylus - the best fine point stylus for iPads, switching out the gyro for the barometer and the compass for the thermometer. Our YuFu electronics are already in production, so this is going to save us a lot of time. It’s also why I can do this with such a low target - we just need to fund the plastic tooling costs. With your help we can bring StormTag to market and improve localised weather predictions. Thanks!

A big thanks to all our backers, many of you have backed a few of my projects and I really appreciate the support! You are not only helping build a product, but a platform of products for the future. The 3 products I have in production have many common parts and they each extend the functionality of your favourite phone or tablet beyond the confines of your pocket or backpack. Multiple Bluetooth StormTag s can deliver weather data to you, and share with the crowd. The aClock Bluetooth Alarm Clock extends the function of your calendar and reminders on your mobile device to your bedside - even when you leave your phone in the kitchen to charge. Finally the YuFu Bluetooth pressure sensitive stylus extends the functionality of the iPad for artists and creative professionals. The common thread is Bluetooth LE and the low power data communication it enables. My company is building a great platform which will integrate all of these products and build many more - I have bunch of exciting ideas in store after we ship our 2014 lineup! I can only describe the interest in StormTag as amazing! Large companies from multiple regions are looking at StormTag for climate data collection in fields as diverse as agriculture, insurance, weather, micro climates in galleries and museums and even paint and surface treatment monitoring. Over the past few weeks our electronics engineers have been working on the final designs for our product and it's coming together nicely - the specs of each component have all been nailed down. Firmware is being worked on to communicate with the SDK in our Apps. Waterproofing and Recharging One of the issues we've been working on is completely sealing the enclosure for 100% waterproofing. With user replaceable batteries there is always the danger that a seal isn't quite perfect, we'd hate to see damage to the electronics caused by a moisture leak. To solve this potential problem I've decided to upgrade our product lineup a little and have two rechargeable power supply methods and drop the CR2032 coin cell. You will still have the same long battery life and all of the other features listed on the Kickstarter campaign. We'll ship a small snap on dongle for USB charging which will take around an hour, the battery itself will last a lifetime, since it will only need charging once per year (or two). So all models will now have either USB rechargeable battery or a solar rechargeable battery - you will also be able to USB charge the solar powered StormTag if you need to keep it in the dark. You don't need to make any changes to your order, the rechargeable upgrade will not cost anything for our preorder and Kickstarter backers. I hope you are as excited by this as I am - I think StormTag is going to change the way we analyse weather, and I appreciate your help bringing it to market! :-) Thanks Jon Hi folks, With a couple of days left to run, we are nearly at our first stretch goal milestone. Awesome - thanks so much! :-) If we hit $100,000 your StormTag data will be shared to the web for IFTTT recipes , the data will get to the web via Apps on your phone or a tablet left charging nearby. But we have bigger plans to help get the data to IFTTT , even when you are not around - we will work towards integration with some Bluetooth to WiFi hubs - the first one will be Apple HomeKit . Apple have released HomeKit specs which StormTag will comply with. I'm not totally sure of course, but I suspect Apple TV might eventually support HomeKit. It makes sense that AppleTV works with BTLE devices in the home, and this would mean we can get StormTag data onto the web. To start with, we'll support IFTTT via the Apps on iOS and Android, but I think we'll see more BT to WiFi hubs fairly soon and we'll integrate with the best of these. We have applied for, and recently been approved for MFi - so StormTag will be built to comply with HomeKit. We will still need to pass the product approval process . Here is a Macworld article which explains HomeKit. I'm also looking at a few other hub devices so IFTTT can work without a phone or tablet nearby. Thanks for your fantastic support - please share with your friends and help us hit the stretch goals! Cheers Jon Hi Backers and Friends, Last week I asked what you would all like as stretch goals for the StormTag and I received an awesome response - thanks very much to everyone who made suggestions. Stretch goals are features that will become available to ALL backers if we hit the $ milestones below in the next 14 days. StormTag Stretch Goals: 1. IFTTT at $100,000, IFTTT allows for recipes, such as "if the temperature reaches X* send an tweet" or "if humidity gets to X send an email". Check it out here: <url>"stick on" mount for StormTag at $125,000, 3. Windows Phone SDK Support at $150,000. Please share the StormTag link with friends and followers and help us hit these stretch goals - Thanks for your support! The extra engineering required for some of the requests would mean a rework and extra cost that is outside of our budget - but since solar power was so popular in suggestions, I have decided to offer a third version of StormTag: StormTag PRO: StormTag Pro includes all of the Stormtag+ goals, plus a solar cell and energy harvesting circuitry, it means that you will never need to change the battery - just add some sunlight every week or so. I've also upgraded the memory to take advantage of the virtually unlimited life - so StormTag PRO will be capable of 2 years data logging. StormTag Pro will also be a totally sealed waterproof unit. The New StormTag Pro rewards can be found here - hit the "Manage Your Pledge" button if you want the upgraded StormTag PRO. Thanks Jon Hi All, I've been thinking about what we can offer if we hit a couple of stretch goals, and I have some ideas - but I'd like to hear what you want. A stretch goal is a feature that will be added to the product if we hit a financial milestone - so for example if we hit $100,000, I will add a new feature and everybody gets that upgrade, If we then hit $150,000 then another upgrade is added. So please hit the main comments page and let me know what you want - is it a new sensor you crave? A software feature? Windows Phone support? Solar power? A wall mounting kit? Or something else? Tell me in the main comments page and I will decide after the weekend! Thanks to everyone for your ongoing support! :-) Jon Hi Backers and Friends, Thanks very much for your support over the past 2 weeks, it's been quite a ride! StormTag has been featured all over the world in many many online articles and it's certainly helped us hit our goal - in fact 338% so far with 4 weeks to run still. I'm interested to hear where you plan to use StormTag - so please take a minute to comment below, it will help me make sure our product fits your needs. Of course it's also very interesting to hear new ideas and use cases that I may not have considered. StormTag is the only 100% waterproof weather sensor and has over a year of data logging - so you can use it for long term outdoor tracking of weather , but of course with our SDK developers will be able to add other functions... Monitor crops and livestock outdoors Monitor warehouse conditions Monitor cold food delivery Monitor food and grain storage conditions Please tell me where you will use StormTag below! Firstly a huge thank you to our awesome backers, StormTag is 50% funded in less than 24 hours. I've had a lot of requests for additional features, after some late night analysis and brainstorming, I have decided to release StormTag+ with the following additional capability: Up to 10 days data logging. Weather data is stored in onboard memory when your phone or tablet is not connected to StormTag+. Humidity Sensor: to provide more accurate forecasting and more complete data collection. UV sensor: StormTag+ will now know if it is outside and provide even more valuable data. StormTag+ will deliver even more accurate data that many people have been asking for. Please consider upgrading your pledge, for a few dollars extra we'll be able to deliver even better data for you - StormTag+ is a very advanced weather station for your keyring! Thanks for your awesome support :-) Jon @Jørgen thanks for your input. It doesn't change things, but thanks anyway. @W. Laging - you are incorrect - it is IP67. It is not a standard USB plug. Hi All, Firstly, the StormTag project is very much alive. The StormTag is still definitely going into production, although I'm waiting on a couple of things to align before I can proceed further (quote negotiations, lead times and so forth). I moved the manufacturing because we are now using a waterproofing process that was not *reliably* available in China. I'm using the delay to work on making the StormTag Apple HomeKit enabled - I already have one of the latest Apple TV's here to develop an Apple TV App, and we are MFi certified so you will be able to ask Siri: "what is the outside temperature", "what is the cellar temperature" etc. So far, the expenditure on the development of the software, hardware and industrial design for the project is considerably over the budget. This means production costs will be funded from company resources. Finally, I find little utility in posting updates or commenting here, it just unleashes a firestorm of negativity and abuse. If we can go a week or two without the hate, I might revise my thinking. However, I give the naysayers about an hour before I hear that's it's all my own doing, I brought it upon myself etc etc... <url>"heartbeat" updates - that is just dumb. 3. I am working on this and other projects, yes - they are taking longer than expected. 4. The follow-up emails sent to previous backers are offering kickstarter prices, if you choose not to purchase more product - that is fine - remove yourself from the list! Each email has a link at the bottom - it isn't difficult to unsubscribe. 5. Yes, I will block or report malicious, obnoxious or harassing tweets directed at me - what of it? 6. Some of you people need to get a grip and calm down, continually posting comments neither speeds up delivery nor changes anything I do on a day to day basis - I am already working as fast as possible. 7. I have every right to defend myself if people are being obnoxious and defaming me or my company. I will be dealing with defamation actions and seeking significant damages in due course - there is a lot of malicious intent with many of the comments. This forum is read in the UK, my company has a presence in the UK - <url>ウェザー - since you are not a backer of our other projects, maybe you don't have all the information. @R_Blake - yes, that will work @Shez - will do my best @Colonel - To change over to the plus or pro, you will need to click the "Manage My Pledge"button and change the reward and amount. @Joe - for data logging you will need the Plus or Pro version. @Pascal - thanks! IFTTT - Stretch goal achieved! Brilliant... IFTTT + StormTag is going to be awesome :-) Thanks everyone @Kevin - and wine cellar :-) @Matt - thanks! I am ordering parts today from our electronics suppliers, so it's all systems go! @MK - the charge cycles are sufficient to allow for more than 10 years of use. @Jake - no the iOS App is not a web page, it will be an App specifically built for StormTag. Data will be available on a web page and is visible now from Android devices already delivering data into the WeatherSignal network. @MK - it can be up to 60feet - 20m. It can be around 1/3 that if there are walls in a building. @Pascal - definitely a native App. @Dag - yes - the PRO is the same physical size. @Marcel - The solar cell is encapsulated in the plastic body and will be protected. @Dag, The battery in the pro version is sealed inside and cannot be replaced, it is recharged by solar panel. @Swampster - You will need to edit the reward. Click "manage my reward" button, then add the pledge amount for the product you wish to add onto the early bird amount you have already pledged. Thanks! @Dag, The range of Bluetooth means that you will only need to walk near the StormTag for the data to sync - just like activity wrist bands auto connect and sync. Correct - the Pro model never needs a new battery - so long as it gets an average of a few hours of light every each week. Plus it has longer data logging if you plan to not visit the location very often where it is located. @Dag - the pro model has a larger memory capacity. Battery life is a separate matter and both models should have around 2 years of battery life depending on temperature and a few other variables. @Frits - WeatherSignal is already launched for Android and will be released for iOS before StormTag ships. @R_Blake - The same basic engineering/design is required for all of these products with some minor changes to the enclosure for the PRO. I do not foresee any changes to the delivery date. @Shez - I'm working on improving that, thanks for your suggestion. @Daniel and @Reagan - The WeatherSignal App who we have partnered with already has an installed user base of 230,000 users (50,000 active) on Android devices. We'll be adding our functionality for iOS and all other Android users who have no weather sensors on their devices. The portability and convenience of the StormTag also enables personal weather/environment monitoring plus of course in home, cellar, basement, closet or outbuilding climate monitoring (which will obviously be isolated from outdoor weather reporting) @Edgar - we'll soon have MFI certification which will enable integration with Apple HomeKit, I will look at additional hub integration where possible or practical. @Rohan - Yes for IFTTT to work it will need to communicate via BTLE - and we're proposing to use on of the hub devices starting to appear in the market. One important thing I didn't mention in the update is Apple HomeKit, I have applied for MFI to enable this via Apple products. I'll have more news on that soon. No photos yet, ID will work on it next week. Thanks! Hi All, see the latest update! StormTag Stretch Goals: 1. IFTTT at $100,000, IFTTT allows for recipes, such as "if the temperature reaches X* send an tweet" or "if humidity gets to X send an email". Check it out here: <url>"stick on" mount for StormTag at $125,000, 3. Windows Phone SDK Support at $150,000. Please share the StormTag link with friends and followers and help us hit these stretch goals StormTag PRO: StormTag Pro includes all of the Stormtag+ goals, plus a solar cell and energy harvesting circuitry, it means that you will never need to change the battery - just add some sunlight every week or so. I've also upgraded the memory to take advantage of the virtually unlimited life - so StormTag PRO will be capable of 2 years data logging. StormTag Pro will also be a totally sealed waterproof unit. @J.T all customer service queries are handled as quickly as possible by our support staff. There are none outstanding. But as I said, you have commented anonymously (and slanderously) So I can't really look up any orders or help you. @J.T - thanks for your input. Clearly you are personally unhappy about something, but since you are posting anonymously I can't help you, please contact us through HEX3 customer support page if you need assistance for anything.Yes JaJa Stylus was delivered later than planned, AppTag was delivered later than planned both approximately 2 years ago, so no further updates or comments from me are required there? Nota was delivered on time. YuFu will be delivered 2.5 months later than planned due to some PCB issues. Updates for all projects are done on a schedule - at the bottom of each recent project page is a table explaining this schedule. My last comment on YuFu was 10 days ago, and an update will be made this afternoon. All backers can email me directly or contact us through the support page at HEX3. Other suggested stretch goals for the StormTag were going to cost quite a bit more in parts, but I can see a lot of interest for Solar power. A few other good suggestions were increased data retention, air quality sensors, wind speed, wifi and a milk frother :-) Apple Home Kit and MFI certification is something I have begun work on because it can deliver some great networking features... Thanks everyone for the suggestions. I'll be posting an update with stretch goals fairly soon. To the below comment, obviously this is what I get for calling out another stylus project for misleading videos and false claims. I have made several comments and updates on all my other projects in accordance with our update published schedule. At this stage, for stretch goals I'm thinking: 1. IFTTT at $100,000, 2. An outdoors mount for StormTag at $125,000, 3. Windows Phone SDK Support at $150,000. @Stephen - yes we are planning a UV index calculation so the raw UV data is easy to interpret. Hi All, This is tremendous feedback! I just got back from a weekend camping in the hills - very cold! I'll be tabulating all of your suggestions over the next few days and have a stretch goal plan soon! Thanks again :-) Jon @Jeffrey - The Kickstarter platform is awesome for all sorts of reasons! I have run 6 successful crowd funded projects so far and the Kickstarter community has helped me in a lot of ways financial assistance is just one of them. The most important thing for me is getting the confidence to develop and build the minimum order quantity at factories - which can be very expensive. Old style "corporations" have product design by committee they design and build products, ship them to stores and then half of them bomb. I can't afford to do this. I see Kickstarter as the beginnings of a new way to do this and it's a lot less wasteful - My company will always float our ideas on KS first, if they do well we'll produce the product - if they don't we wont. Another great facet of our Kickstarter campaigns is the huge amount of input we get from our backers - asking for features and telling us how they will use our product - just look at the 55 comments here: <url>¹Imp - we're considering Windows phone and will probably make it a stretch goal next week - still waiting on some info I need. Great comments folks - for more amazing uses of StormTag you should also take a look at the comments on Update#3! @Iloy - great idea, I think we should be able to create some very interesting data for you! Crop farmers will find data equally useful, from visiting farms out West I know that localised conditions can change grain harvest times - perhaps we can help reduce the use of artificial ripening agents (usually roundup: <url>"contact me" link under my photo ----> Thanks @Roderick - Our humidity and temperature sensor is open to the air (via a small filter) the temperature should be very quick to stabilise, since we are measuring air temperature rather than the temperature of the case. @Shilohtd - we are still working out if we can do a windows sdk. I will make a decision in the next week after I can discuss with the software engineers. And thanks for the pedge! @Gaston - Yes there will be a battery low notification. @Nathan, Quite simple to change. It's a CR2032 button cell battery. @Tony - yes, for accurate readings it will need to be outside. We have a switch in the App for indoors/outdoors. We also have some algorithms to determine if the readings are accurate - including the UV reading and comparing them to data from other users in the area. @joebar - sorry, I should have added that the sensor will deliver –40 to +125 °C *operating* range. To be clear the other number below is the tolerance specs, so it will be ±0.4 °C inside the –10 to 85 °C range. The tolerances are a little less accurate in -40 to -1 and 85 to 125, I do not know the accuracy in the very hot or cold ranges but will find out. The upper range is probably not as important for most people<!> - but I personally spend a lot of time in the mountains - regularly around -30 and StormTag will definitely work in this range! Sorry for the confusion! @Konkelenberg - we are thinking of adding tracking to the tag, but we don't want to impact battery life. @Andrew as an example, one of the many sensors we are testing has these specs for temp and humidity: Precision Relative Humidity Sensor ± 4% RH (max), 0–80% RH High Accuracy Temperature Sensor ±0.4 °C (max), –10 to 85 °C @Johan Thank you! @Ivan I'll add that to our feature request list! - thanks @Geremy - a developer API will be produced, we will consider Windows. @Matt - this is a chicken and egg problem - thankfully we have teamed up with WeatherSignal who have 50,000 users - it's explained more in this TechCrunch article: <url>"contact me" button under my profile photo - they go into an inbox for me, comments can be on any number of updates or the main project) I'll always do my best to answer in as timely a manner as possible! Thanks @Reagan - sorry I missed your query, thanks @Matt for answering that. @Ian - I am afraid due to the tight costs on the extra sensors in StormTag+ it is as low as it can go. @Kevin - not sure about the comment, maybe you made it on an update? Anyway, if you wanted to get both the Earlybird and also a StormTag+ you would need to get a friend to back it, the way KS is setup you can only choose one reward. Thanks! @Matt - Thanks! @Peggy - Thanks for that, and I'm looking forward to delivering StormTag - it's looking very promising that I can start ordering parts soon! Very exciting :-) @Matt - thanks for pointing that out - please take another look, one of my edits didn't stick... Hi All, I've just made an update with some extra sensors - I hope this answers some of your queries. @Robert - iOS App will come before launch. @Chris - The UV Sensor should help here, we also have an "indoor" switch in the App @JonnyX - I'm yet to fully spec the waterproofness, but I'm aiming to achieve sufficient waterproofing for all outdoor sports whatever the weather. (I want mine to work while skiing - and there are occasional wet icy days out there!) Thanks! @joebar - yes that's great - thanks! @Robert - I am discussing internal logging of data inside the device with my electronics engineer - more on that soon. Thanks Hi Robert, StormTag could definitely use humidity data. I am currently discussing the addition of logging and extra sensors with my electronics engineer. More news on that soon. Battery life is over a year, our transmission frequency is low and the length of time this transmission takes is very small, so battery life is great. The ability to separate the sensors from your phone is the main advantage. Also depending on your phone model, our sensors - particularly temperature - may be more accurate. Thanks! On the bright side, no more backing of Kickstarter projects, or any support for crap ideas from the StormTag creator. It’s a legacy he should be proud of Big scam this project. Jon Atherton is a thief. our Money is spent on e.g. his Tesla and we will never get anything. Invoking rights has no use since Kickstarter does nothing, They also have their share of our money.

I demand a full refund for my pledge amount I'm so glad 2 years ago I removed all my comments from the page and sent Jon my home address to jump through the loopholes he imposed to get my refund.. Maybe it's just lost in the mail. I did ask for a refund more than a year ago. Never heard of it. Kickstarter do nothing to helpme either. I just stoped funding ANY KS project. Shane on you Kickstarter!!! I invoke my rights under Kickstarter's Terms of Use: <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill." I demand a full refund for my pledge amount. Jon bought a new Tesla with the cash. He's had it a while now, so the second hand value is a lot less. Some small comfort. He won't be able to scam Kickstarter again either.... 😀 I have repeatedly requested that my order be canceled and my costs refunded, but have not had any replies. I no longer have any confidence in Kickstarter’s project management! I have even reported Jon and KS to the FBI... Meh, you can say stop doing things all you want, its good to just formally document it. I guess I never commented any other time than to say I've formally given up on this one. Like most of us who have probably backed 10+ projects, I give up too, easier to wait for a tried and true product, Amazon Prime shows up 2 days later (at the latest)... I agree with you fellows, KS is dead as far as I’m concerned, the best part was when they blocked me from contacting them re Jon the scam boi. If there is any consolation in any of this it’s that Jon’s daughter may end up being an internationally renowned swimmer and whilst I would hate to draw her into this, the fact is the press will take more interest in the amount of money he scammed if she continues to kick goals. when I delete my Kickstarter account (and never look back to this scam-platform) - will I still be able to receive my refund/reward for Arist/ZNAPS StormTag? #dareToAsk @Frank, I've stopped backing too. By the time an overdue product turns up, I could have bought something better elsewhere. All, stop posting this "invoking" thing. It has no use. Kickstarter does NOTHING, and this Thief has all our money. We wont get anything. Jon Atherton is just laughing at us. And kickstarter is loosing more and more people and they really do not care. It seems that this platform allows this kind of scams and does nothing to prevent it or protecting their backers. All waste of time. I'll take my loss. Never will fund anything again on @kickstarter. Sorry for the Good projects and people with good intentions, but from a backers point of view kickstarter leaves us no choice. They do not respond nor react. I haven't received my product yet. I invoke my rights under Kickstarter's Terms of Use: <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill." I demand a full refund for my pledge amount. i just found an article about this guy ripping off investors internationally... <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill." I want a refund. Kickstarter's Terms of Use: <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill." I want a refund Reported John Atherton, Hex3 and Kickstarter to the FBI - it may take a while, but if more people report this, the faster it will be investigated and our money refunded... The form to fill-out is here: <url>"game over" for me too ! I invoke my rights under Kickstarter's Terms of Use: <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill." I demand an immediate full refund for my pledge amount This fraud doesn't care. AGAIN I WRITE: I invoke my rights under Kickstarter's Terms of Use: <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill." Hi Peter J and others, Jon is definitely residing in Brisbane Australia so the more people that complain via Acorn the more likely he will be prosecuted Takes a while to complete the online form but if 2,268 people completed it I'm sure they'd take notice. Think he lives in the USA now though. One business registered in Honk Kong, one in America. <url>"Thank you for submitting a report to the ACORN. Your ACORN Reference Number (ARN) is [Removed]." @JvdP he logs in to laugh at us... that's all... Getting ideas for new scams. @Paul, thanks for the info @Max.....Jon resides in Australia and people from other countries can still lodge a complaint on ACORN In the UK you can report the fraud here: <url>"developer" to describe the person who created this campaign. Scam artist is more appropriate I think. Thief even more so. wheres our refunds you have spoilt this for honest developers I applied for the refund, I never got it anyway. This is one big scam. ...fuck! I too have lost significant money from fraudsters on kickstarter such as this guy. Kickstarter deserve to be investigated for their practices They are making money hand over fist at the expense of us. Surely something like making all creators put money in an insurance scheme so that backers are covered could be investigated? If you check his other Kickstarter, the YuFu stylus, there are backers claiming to have received an email from him fairly recently..... Doing my semi-regular circuit of all the failed or outright scam campaigns I pledged money towards. See nothing has changed here. We're all still waiting for that promised refund "Creator". At least we're no longer being spammed by discount offers for other products you haven't made / never intended to make (or maybe i simply blocked them). STILL NOTHING STILL NOTHING Kickstarter promoted two of his projects, that both failed. No refund as per the terms of the agreement, or as he stated. He promoted an offer for 'pre orders' that weren't delivered. Currently he's on Twitter boasting of spending cash on his hobby of motor racing. Nothing to forget here, until Kickstarter investigate this fraudster. Oh well, time to move on... Hope he gets his. And @Kickstarter, you suck for letting this happen. I want my refund. I applied for the refund, I never got it anyway. This is one big scam. Want my refund Where is my refund , i pledged usd 81 for this and never ever received anything. Also kickstarter, very dissapointed in the way you are helping your users. Your refund window was pathetically short. Refund my money please. Please refund my money..... Just had another Kickstarter project fail (MIITO) but the creator's had the decency to post a long and apologetic post explaining why AND advising partial refunds will be offered. At times like this I like to visit the comments of my other failed projects on the off-chance something has happened and the creators have suddenly decided to keep their promises & issue refunds. I see nothing like that is happening here though. :( When Kickstarter works, it is great, I've got some fantastic things from campaigns. Unfortunately Kickstarter wants NOTHING to do with failing / failed / stalled projects despite the damage it does to the brand. The opportunists are now flocking to crowdfunding sites for a quick buck. The sites really need to start policing themselves if they want to continue as viable businesses. If not, they will wink out of existence when the crowdfunding bubble eventually bursts. Laughing all the way to the bank! Something to read about consider <url>"Each project on Kickstarter is an independent work by a creator. They receive payment directly at the end of a successful funding period in order to fund their project and fulfill rewards. That money never actually passes through our hands — we only receive a small fee." Well, that does also mean if the project is a scam (and stormtag IS a SCAM), kickstarter should also give back that 'small fee' to each backer! Otherwise kickstarter is also NOT serious! Legally, if he's offered a refund, and backers have accepted that offer, then he's obliged fulfill that contract. Not drive around in a $100,000 Tesla gloating. "I didn't even receive an email notice about the form to claim the refund until after the window had closed." Don't worry, nobody got or will get their cash back. Put it down to experience and stop using crowdfunding sites which simply breed more and more cons. You're a sad cheating lying worthless scumbag Atherton. Was that considerate and respectable enough? Just re-read the campaign page for laughs. "StormTag is the best Bluetooth Weather Station for Android & iOS." appears at the top of the page. HA! Thinking of the Star Wars gag in the first Austin Powers film: "Austin... know this...[HEAVY BREATHING] I am your Father!" "REALLY?" "No..... not really.... I can't back that up...." Don't worry though people. I clicked on the magical report button. I'm sure Kickstarter are going to get right on top of this and sort it out for us.... Our refunds - minus any administrative costs ("that's only fair, of course...") - should be on their way to us in no time. Haha, check this :<url>— we only receive a small fee. As funds are disbursed directly to the project creator, we're unable to facilitate refunds. That said, I hope that this matter is resolved soon and am here to help if you have any other questions or concerns. Best, Gary What a scam!!! @TrashMan there's no refunds. It was a scam as well. Interesting that Adam Buerk is logging in regularly now. When the illusion was that the Storm Tag was still ongoing, the creator logged in very infrequently. No product, no refund. Let's just keep logging in to keep this active, the YuFu backers seem completely oblivious to recent events and should be kept informed. Anyone have their refund yet? Anyone want to tell us about any updates on refunds? I guess not... I'd like to know why Kickstarter doesn't step in and like lie to us and tell us that they are looking into it and he's banned... SOMETHING... The Tesla was delivered in February 2015, and in March 2015 an update was posted, promising exciting news for the 27th. The news must have about better alloys on his motor, because in April he had little to report. Probably because driving the Tesla to the coast took up valuable development time.... He frequently sent emails to buy more, perhaps these coincided with the due dates of his HP payments? The ScamTag will no doubt eventually turn up on Amazon. "Atherton -­ a tanned, 50­ year­ old mobile app developer and entrepreneur"... You spelt "dishonest, thieving scam artist" wrong The Australian. No product, No refund, No communication. If you are wondering where all your money went let me put you out of your misery, it bought Jon the scammer a nice shiny new Tesla and the bas***d has the front to get himself in the Australian newspaper driving it. I can only hope he will be the next casualty of a self driving car accident. This newspaper is subscription only so I have saved it to dropbox for everyone to see. <url>"food" before I invest in any KickScam projects Imagine that, no product and no refund as promised... Kickstarter doesn't care. I'm done with them. What was the point of the refund page I filled out? More scam? Selling email addresses to spammers? @Brad Silcox - Don't worry, even those who opted in aren't getting a refund, you didn't miss out on anything - we're all equally screwed by this scumbag. Why did this campaign not refund the backers through kickstarter as ZRRO did? I've been through this before and seen something not make it, in fact I didn't have to go online to opt-in for a refund, it just showed up in my account without me taking action. Granted the project creators did a great job communicating with the backers and I was aware it was coming. I didn't even receive an email notice about the form to claim the refund until after the window had closed. I'd feel if we give someone our money for 2 years, they should give us more than 30 days to request it back when they fail to deliver on the product. Jon Atherton ist wohl defintiv ein Betrüger. Kickstarter bietet leider keine Möglichkeit gegen solche Subjekte vorzugehen, bedeutet für mich, dass ich in Zukunft mein Geld für Dinge ausgeben werde, die von seriösen Händlern anggeboten werden. Kickstarter ist zwar kein Händler, aber bietet Betrügern einen Plattform. Jon Atherton = scum Still awaiting refund for this as well, has anyone received their refund? Still awaiting refund for this as well, has anyone received their refund? I know that another similar project Stonether has failed and a bunch of them are getting backers involve for a suit, is there anyone here leading the charge? So where's the refund? I find it amusing that the dickhead creator still logs in almost weekly but isn't man enough to update his piece of crap scams Did not receive any refunds of my pledge. Total scam! <url>"Gee, I wish I had a StormTag so I could have seen this coming". So what is everyone else going to do with their refund that'll be here by "early April"? Still waiting on refund Still waiting on refund Surprised if anyone gets a refund, or one worth mentioning. He could have refunded by PayPal, but chose not to. That says a lot Has anyone received their refund? I missed the window because I stopped checking up on this project months ago, but it'd still be nice to know if anyone saw any money back. Hey still waiting my refund I missed the window to claim my refund now I'm out $160 and dont even get the tags? Please extend the refund window as we extended our patience waiting for this product! I want a refund. Have people been able to contact Jon or the new guy? What is everyone going to do seeing deadline is coming? @Adam Burcke + Jon Atherton I also have oppted for a YUFU-stylus and a NOTA-stylus with a 40$ off. add. What is going to be done with that. Will I get my money back? Thank you for answering me. Total Scam! I have spent $200 total between the storm tags and the aClock. No product received. No communication here, email or facebook. I filed a Better Business Bureau complaint yet they are not replying to that either. Better Business Bureau says we need to take this to court. Want to discuss as a group in a Facebook group? Complaints found here: <url># Submit a Better Business Bureau complaint here: <url>’re unable to complete their project, and communicate with backers at every step along the way. While Kickstarter is the platform for this agreement, we are not a part of it. We do not investigate a project creator’s ability to complete their project, nor do we facilitate refunds or the fulfillment of rewards. While in most cases you’ll find that rewards are delivered as promised, it’s also important to realize that some projects might not fulfill as planned. When you back a project on Kickstarter you enter into an agreement with the project creator, as described in our Terms of Use: <url>’t fulfill their obligations under the agreement. We hope that backers will consider using this provision only in cases where they feel that a creator has not made a good faith effort to complete the project and fulfill. I hope that this helps to address your concerns, but please don’t hesitate to let us know if you have any other questions. Best, Whats the guessing his cheques will bounce? I'm at a loss as to why there are additional steps since our original arrangement, Jon. The deal we made, at your bequest, was to delete KS comments for a PayPal refund. I have held up my end of that agreement. Now, 10 weeks late on your delivery of THAT refund, I am told to give you more information on a third party site for a check-sent refund. This is the third deal with you I've honored and you have not. Is $35 to shut me up really not worth it to you? Why are you such a scumbag? And please, do google the definition of scumbag before you try to have this comment removed, as it's use here is literal and not defamatory at all - you are an objectively objectionable person. ??? The cheque refund concept is designed to be as inconvenient as possible, thus reducing the number signing up to it. Who knows, perhaps he is collecting addresses so he can sue some for 'alleged libel', whilst completing ignoring his obligations as a 'creator'. Is Kickstarter investigating or should we use the refund site. I dont accept that I should have to cover his costs. Yes, I too want a refund of my pledge. If Kickstarter says you must refund, then the issue of fees and expenses is something Jon Atherton must cover. Not me. Why not use PayPal? In 2014, PayPal moved $228 billion in 26 currencies across more than 190 nations. @Myself, +1. While the website yufustylus.com was another one of his junk scam projects, I am still very shady of the refund process. I'm very suspicious of the address and the phone number is obviously fake. The address kicks back as a wix.com web hosting office in San Fran. It would be nice to get something back, (I'm out 166 USD) which kinda sucks, but I bet by the time fees are all paid it will only amount to a few bucks. He hasn't delivered anything yet, I don't know why anyone would trust him now. A cheque is not suitable, please refund by PayPal This user's account has been deleted. This form for a refund (after deducting fees and expenses) speaks of all Hex3 projects. But it does not speak of items bought and not delivered by Jon Atherton. What are Hex3 products? I think this form is not covering all Jon Athertons projects gone bad. I'm requesting that you refund my pledge as it seems at this point that you cannot fulfill it, or are unwilling to. Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill. Terms of use are here: <url>"Kickstarter account name" ? Kickstarter don't appear to use account names anymore, just your email address - Or do they mean your full name? Either way it is redundant repetition and an opportunity to deny your claim if you get it wrong. Not holding my breath. "Thank you for completing the project refund request, we will process the refund in accordance with the terms. Please do not attempt to complete the form more than once per project. We are unable to offer email support on this process, but will update you when refund advices are dispatched. Back to Form" I've kept very quiet on this as a backer - and while a refund is a very welcome step I believe it should be managed and provided via Kickstarter. I did not back this with a cheque and do not want a cheque for refund. Nor am I inclined to provide fill in a form on a website that is really no more legitimate than a phishing / fake storefont site as far as I can tell. C'mon kickstarter - time for you to step in. We all know you can if you choose to. Now that the development is done, a minimal amount is refunded and the a tag rebranded, wonder what it will be called now? Obviously the 'Storm Tag' brand is redundant. Wow we got this form for a a refund. Maybe my complaining helped? Lets see if we really get money lol. I'm requesting that you refund my pledge as it seems at this point that you cannot fulfill it, or are unwilling to. Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill. Terms of use are here: <url>"Be respectful and considerate." because I do not feel like you have been this to me at all. Well there you go... be sure to note the bottom of the form where it says that the funds are pro-rata. Why are people so impatient? @Max. I have written it off and I only read (for satirical reasons) and remarked recently because, well maybe I do hope for a positive outcome, wait...no...LMAO! Anyways, gentleman Jon has finally admitted that the project is OFFICIALLY DEAD. He claims that refunds will be given and there is a form that must be filled. I don't know why we need to as I have had other campaigns refunded without my interaction. But, I'll bite. Everyone have a great Memorial Day. Back to the steak and beer. OORAH! For those that have served, thank you. Semper Fidelis! I'm requesting that you refund my pledge as it seems at this point that you cannot fulfill it, or are unwilling to. Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill. Terms of use are here: <url>"Kickstarter said the matter under was investigation." "Anyone who abuses our system and the trust of our community exposes themselves to legal action," said its spokesman David Gallagher. "We're reaching out to the law enforcement officials who are already looking into this case, and will assist however we can." " Kickstarter would have to employ A LOT more people to deal with this kind of problem if they gave as much of a crap about all the dodgy projects as they do about this one and had to reach out to law enforcement officials for each of them. <url>"Early next week [First week of April]" Date of refund received: TBD (Quickly closing on 2 months overdue) Moral of the story: Jon is continuing to operate with unethical business practices. The promise of a refund is only to get comments deleted, and will not result in a refund. The refund offer is disingenuous, PLEASE do not remove comments in an attempt to get a refund - he is NOT refunding money. I'm kindly requesting that you refund my pledge as it seems at this point that you cannot fulfill it, or are unwilling to. Project Creators MUST fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill. Terms of use are here: <url>"Upon My Command, Unleash Hell!" I'm requesting that you refund my pledge as it seems at this point that you cannot fulfill it, or are unwilling to. Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill. Terms of use are here: <url>"refund" but he really isn't. He is asking ppl to remove comments for refunds. Which seems shady as hell. In name of all the backers of the StormTag I urge you to give some sort of statement. Because we infested not just 5 dollars, but over 40 dollars each in this project. And not hearing anything shows us how shitty you think about us. While we actually make projects happen! So please please please look into helping us getting our money back. The creator is making 0 real effort into anything. Even the website of the Stormtag has been taken offline! Thanks, in name of all backers, <url>"deleted" posts and work out why they were removed. Swearing would be an obvious reason for KS to remove but other reasons would be worth a read - <url>"Early next week"... five weeks ago): Jon Atherton Mar 10 2016 We have decided to refund your pledge to StormTag. Once you have been refunded you will no longer have access to the StormTag updates page. To receive a refund you must do the following: 1. Delete all comments that have been made on this projects page. You may need to contact Kickstarter customer support and ask that they remove your comments and include the dates of all the comments you have made. 2. Reply to this message with the following: a. your Paypal account email address b. your pledge amount We will then process your refund. Regards Jon www.jonatherton.com Michael L Keller Mar 10 2016 Please find below the required information for refund processing: Comment Deletion - Ongoing process, Kickstarter has been engaged PayPal Address - [Redacted] Pledge Amount - $35 Regards, Mike Jon Atherton Mar 10 2016 Thanks Andrew, PLEASE NOTE - the refund can not be processed until after your comments have been successfully removed. Please confirm your details after that time. Jon Atherton Mar 10 2016 Apologies - *Mike* Michael L Keller Mar 16 2016 Hi Jon, My comments have been removed from the StormTag kickstarter page. I'll look forward to the timely refund of $35 submitted to my paypal account at [Redacted] Regards, Mike Michael L Keller Mar 24 2016 Hi Jon, What type of turnaround timing can I expect on processing this refund? It has been over a week since I've met my end of the agreement, and provided the information requested for processing my refund, but I have neither heard confirmation of my request, or received my refund. Regards, Mike Michael L Keller Mar 29 2016 Hi Jon, I appreciate that you are busy, but require an update on this issue. Given my past dealings with you, I do not trust in your ability to deliver, and as such, require active communication from you until my refund is recieved. Continued lack of a response will lead me to believe this refund offer is not sincere. Please respond in the next 56 hours (by 3/31), or I will have no choice but to believe your end of the refund agreement is not being upheld, and return to working with the community to raise awareness via comments on the project page and other social media forums of your poor communication and haphazard projects. Regards, Mike Jon Atherton Mar 29 2016 Your refund will be processed early next week. I'm collating them and doing them at same time. Regards Jon Atherton Michael L Keller Apr 19 2016 Hi Jon, It has been 3 weeks since you passed along that refunds would be ready "early next week", and 5 weeks since my compliance and removal of KS comments . Is there a reason for the delay? When can I expect my PayPal account to be credited? Thanks, Mike Last update 8 months ago. Nice one <url>"Elgato Eve Weather" is so offensive that it got taken down by kickstater. At least its a real product not a this mythical ks fraud product. There I have posted it again :-P Seems dead. Deader than a Dodo, more like dead as a Yufu, as a Dodo once existed, whereas a Yufu is completely nonexistent. It's a kind of fictional Kickstarter unicorn. Is this project dead? It has been 18 months since the campaign was complete and credit cards were charged. Yoshimi is right, from Terms of Use (Oct 2012): "A Project Creator is not required to grant a Backer’s request for a refund unless the Project Creator is unable or unwilling to fulfill the reward. Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill." Why is kickstarter removing these comments! Let them take action on this pure fraud!!! People get angry with People like Jon Atherton. I already accept the loss of my money on this THIEF. Down side is that KICKSTARTER is taking no action at all then removing comments. And since this experience I fund less and less projects so it impacts also to good projects. Kickstarter should start kicking ass instead of doing nothing. Fuck you Jon, I'm requesting that you refund my pledge as it seems at this point that you cannot fulfill it, or are unwilling to. Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill. Terms of use are here: <url>’m sorry you’ve been experiencing these issues with communication. We've reached out to the creator with a reminder of their obligations to their backer community, and have forwarded along your concerns and those of your fellow backers. While we're disheartened that they have not yet updated backers on the status of their project, we're unable to force them to do so — it's the creator's responsibility to communicate and complete the project as promised. Backing a project on Kickstarter is an expression of trust and can help lead to the creation of new and exciting things. But it’s important to remember that sometimes complications arise that might prevent a project from unfolding as planned — or from happening at all. This certainly isn’t ideal, but we hope that creators and backers will try to communicate with each other through these developments. Although we are unable to offer refunds, we are constantly working to improve the vetting process for creators and thank you for sharing your experience. We hope you’ll continue to be an active member of the Kickstarter community as we learn and grow. Best, XXXX I wrote a complaint to Kickstarter last night. Here's yet another generic answer. *sigh* I believe we won't ever see a product, or a refund. Here at Kickstarter, we expect creators to fulfill rewards, offer refunds if they’re unable to complete their project, and communicate with backers at every step along the way. While Kickstarter is the platform for this agreement, we are not a part of it. We do not investigate a project creator’s ability to complete their project, nor do we facilitate refunds or the fulfillment of rewards. While in most cases you’ll find that rewards are delivered as promised, it’s also important to realize that some projects might not fulfill as planned. When you back a project on Kickstarter you enter into an agreement with the project creator, as described in our Terms of Use: <url>’t fulfill their obligations under the agreement. We hope that backers will consider using this provision only in cases where they feel that a creator has not made a good faith effort to complete the project and fulfill. I hope that this helps to address your concerns, but please don’t hesitate to let us know if you have any other questions. Best, (Name withheld to protect the staff member, not their fault) This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. Perhaps Kickstarter could 'reach out' and ask about the current status of this project..... If the developer fails to deliver the product to us, we should either get a refund, or have Kickstarter take action. I urge everyone to file a formal complaint with KickStarter and see if together we can obtain resolution to this. It's been going on far too long! Total scam... Jon Atherton ran with the money. Don't back anything related to Jon Atherton or Hex3 as he is a fraud. Still waiting nothing happen I don't think any of us goone get refund Hi Jon, I'm requesting that you refund my pledge as it seems at this point that you cannot fulfill it, or are unwilling to. Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill. Terms of use are here: <url>’s also why I can do this with such a low target - we just need to fund the plastic tooling costs. I have reported the lack of communication to KickStarter - It would even be an improvement if they reported a failure to complete the project for some reason. At least that would offer some form of closure. I backed at the 2 x Stormtag level so expect that at least half of my pledge would be refunded in the case of a project failure/closure. A project can fail and money lost - that's how KS works, but as half of that pledge was for the extra product that was never made available... Please refund my pledge! Anyone refund yet after deleting comments? Not deleting till I hear he is doing so. Reply from kickstarter: Thanks for reaching out and taking the time to bring this to our attention. I’ve reached out to this creator and offered our assistance. My goal is to open the lines of communication and encourage them to update more effectively moving forward. You should continue reaching out to them on your end as well. Through this joint effort, we’ll be reminding the creator to check in. We do our best to give project creators the freedom and support necessary to bring their new and exciting ideas to life. This often means that when projects launch on Kickstarter they’re in the early stages of development. While we encourage creators to communicate regularly through this process, it’s important to remember that each of them will approach this differently. In most cases, this may be the first time that a creator has the responsibility of communicating with a large support community. Still, we expect that creators will make every effort to complete their project as promised and keep backers updated along the way. We also hope that backers will remain understanding as everyone learns through this process. Thanks for being a thoughtful backer and member of the Kickstarter community. I hope you hear more from the project creator soon. Best, Reply from Kickstarter contact us. Very cut and paste; shows they want creators to abide by their rules but have no way of enforcing them. Waste of time. I think Jon just likes the attention, hense the random updates ones or twice a year. "As the creators and stewards of Kickstarter, we hate more than anything when a project doesn't come to fruition. Allowing creators to take risks and attempt to bring something new to life is the backbone of what we do. However, we also understand that there is an inherent level of risk in any creation process. Kickstarter is built around minimizing that risk through all-or-nothing funding, which allows the collective voice of the people to decide which projects reach their goal. On our end, we review projects, uphold our rules, practice careful governance, and use anti-fraud filtering. The foundation of the entire system, however, is the collective wisdom of the people who back projects. Still, despite a creator's best efforts, some projects won't always come together as planned. In these situations we make ourselves available to creators to help however we can, and we encourage them to be as open as possible with their backers about the obstacles they face. But no matter our efforts, projects will sometimes fail to come together as planned and backers will sometimes be disappointed in outcomes. We strive to constantly learn from this, and to make sure that expectations are appropriately set for backers (like on our Trust & Safety page). If you have feedback on ways that we can improve this experience and more appropriately set expectations, please let us know. It’s our mission to make sure that Kickstarter is a place where folks can launch and support projects with confidence and excitement." Anyone noticed Jon is no longer taking preorders on Kickstarter, I wonder of KS finally woke up to the fact it's a scam. Some interesting posts from Jon the Con on the yufu page complete with legal threats aimed at anyone with the bad manners to question his scamming ways. It seems, by his own admission, that he never had enough money to complete that project and is seeking 3rd party funding......he says he ran out of money in 2014 but was still taking orders until recently. What a joke of a human being and a mockery that KS allow people Li,e this to openly exploit the goodwill of their backers. Hi Jon. Can we have an update ? Thanks Hi Jon, I'm requesting that you refund my pledge as it seems at this point that you cannot fulfill it, or are unwilling to. Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill. Terms of use are here: <url>"Delivered" when I'm actually still waiting for my refund!!! Guys, check your "View Pledge" under "Backed Projects" on your main personal menu, no wonder why Kickstarter gives a darn about our current situation!!! Jon, I request a fully refund of my pledge. I hope you will react on this. By then I will ask kickstarter to remove my comments. I want a refund to. I have no faith in this. Can someone clarify if a) no Storm Tags will be produced, hence a refund or b) the product is still due for delivery at some point in the near future, refund is optional ? Can anyone who's received a refund share your experience? Meaning will Jon stand by his word about deleting comments then refunding? Though I find that unfair - if he's a man of his word, I'll join the bandwagon. What a disappointment.

Terms of use are here: <url>ørgen te Giffel I posted it more as a review of Kickstarter procedures than a particular reference to Storm Tag. Having said that, complexity comes in many forms, incuding patents, patent infringement, trade names (see my post below :), development, manufacturing and distribution. It of course doesn't excuse Jon, sitting home in his $2000 a week Condo completely ignoring his project backers. @MaxStarter: the keyword here is 'complex'. nobody would consider this StormTag complex. With the 'Terms of use' by KickStarter - a creator is required to fullfill his promise - KickStarter gave ME the impression that KickStarter is monitoring a project to make sure a creator meets the Terms of Use. As it turns out, KickStarter just takes the money and therefore KickStarter is also (partially) responsible for smartasses that refuse to acknowledge a project is failed and therefore won't have to pay back / be accountable for the fund-spendings. Independent review of Kickstarter: <url>"our" terms state that Jon is obligated to deliver the funded product. How will that help us as Kickstarter does not even want to be involved when a Backee does not live up to the agreement with Kickstarter once Kickstarter has received its money? Jon himself might still believe he will deliver "at some point in time", but I think he's no longer in touch with reality Here's the response I got: "Hi Brian, Here at Kickstarter HQ, we expect creators to fulfill rewards, offer refunds if they’re unable to complete their project, and communicate with backers at every step along the way. While Kickstarter is the platform for this agreement, we are not a part of it. We do not investigate a project creator’s ability to complete their project, nor do we facilitate refunds or the fulfillment of rewards. While in most cases you’ll find that rewards are delivered as promised, it’s also important to realize that some projects might not fulfill as planned. When you back a project on Kickstarter you enter into an agreement with the project creator, as described in our Terms of Use: <url>’t fulfill their obligations under the agreement. We hope that backers will consider using this provision only in cases where they feel that a creator has not made a good faith effort to complete the project and fulfill. I hope that this helps to address your concerns, but please don’t hesitate to let us know if you have any other questions. Best, Gary" I got one of those generic "this is how kickstarter works..." and "here are our terms of service when you pledge to a project..." types of email responses. I tried reasoning with the customer service agent, but alas... it gets us nowhere. Legal action is really the only recourse at this point. I suggest we band together and find someone willing to sue this guy and get our pledges back. Good idea Kirsten Blom - This was the response - "It looks like you've already reported this project to us. While we're unable to respond to reports individually, please know that our Integrity Team screens each report against Our Rules and Community Guidelines. Thanks for your understanding." Guys, please all report this project. There is a button on the lower end of the campaign page for it. It will notify Kickstarter. There is a post-payment issueu option for non communicative ppl. So Jon will you ever provide an update again........or I'd this product is never going to eventuate then just come clean and advise us accordingly please I posted moooonths ago that everyone should contact their credit card companies and see if they will refund your money as a fraud claim. I got my money back with no fuss. As for the creator, Jon, I gotta hand it to you. It takes some skill to defraud so many people, from us here at kickstarter to Japanese businessmen, but I guess the business of the con isn't exactly new. You really should consider a run as a politician. I filed a complaint with the Australian authorities, reporting Jon Atherton as a scam artist with two projects, Yufu stylus and Stormtag. I believe everyone affected should do the same! The best news is that you can still purchase a StormTag on the Hex3 site before Christmas. This is a great gift for all of those who compel you to buy them a gift, although you never really wanted to get them anything. Hex3 will send you an legitimate conformation for your $69 (plus shipping) & rest assured the undesirable recipient who the StormTag was 'purchased' for will perish before John gets around to sending ANY of us anything! We should do a kickstarter to sue his ass. Fraud! I'm considering writing an article about crowdfunding, and intend to mention some of the good and bad experiences (this would fall into the latter). If you're interested in contributed, by way of answering some questions, email me at <email> Give up on this failure there is already a similar device on the market that you can actually receive ! <url>~$300,000 or so from all the crowd funding campaigns, but he could have been sitting on 10x that if he'd actually brought them to market. If you guys look at his previous track record, it looks like we might not be see this item any time soon. @Creator - I hope you are making progress. Could we get an update please? If anyone is serious about it, please contact any friends that are lawyers. This guy deserves another class action lawsuit. I don't know anyone personally, but with this big network, someone sure knows a lawyer or two. I wrote several Messages to Jon…but no answer. Storm Tag isn't Yufu. No App to develop. The electronics could come courtesy of Texas Instruments, yet a year later there is no product and no updates I consider this a complete loss. John basically stole our money with the promise of would could have been a really awesome product. #Failed Wow still no stormtag and almost no updates for two months. It's been a year since we were first given a delivery date. I understand things can be delayed but by a year seems a bit ridiculous along with a lack of information as to why things have been delayed. One of these days maybe we will get a Stormtag but I am not holding my breath. I almost forgot I even funded this. Is this being made by Bigfoot at the location of the alien autopsy? Updates??? Still waiting for a product and still believing that it would be great. But God knows when :) Unbelievable there's no sign of news since 2 months (!!!!) Surprising that there is no update as to what is happening, the current status of this project, when manufacture and distribution will start..... Tap Here for YuFu Now I see Hex3 is having another 15 hour sale for 40% off! 112k dollars... Wonder what kind of car we bought him??? Hope it was at least Italian... I ordered additional StormTag's after the misleading "Last chance - Address Survey" from July 16th, expecting shipment soon after July 16th. Now I try to undo this additional order via my CC-company, and Hex3.co challenged my recall, by stating that StormTags will ship in December 2015. Therefore I still hope to get a StormTag by end January 2016 Updates,please. <url>"going on"... This guy is a joke by least means.. I am going to see if Texas Instruments has beaten Jon to the punch. <url>"YuFu, the styles perfected", due April 2014. What are the protocols for a class action lawsuit? A year later. No product. No explanation. And it seems, no shame at all. A small colour change LED display showing icons similar to the picture above. That would be useful. The mark II version.....assuming the Mark I arrives. Jørgen - I find your comments insensitive! When one glues their fingers together as has occurred in this incident... it can take many years to recover and do anything productive. Good thing for us and all the other backers that the bots running strong and pushing HEX3 products so we know that HEX3 is still able to accept our payments. @John: I imagine that Jon has received the plastic top en bottom parts and currently is superglueing both parts together to create a weatherproof StormTag. Unfortunately his vingers were glued together in the process so he won't be able to logon and type an update for his backers or even handle envelopes to mail the StormTag for another year This is coming up on a year over due. What is going on here??? @Alex: I don't feel any need to be friends with a creator and I won't suck it up! You insulte all backers stating that an entrepeneur on Kickstarter asking for help to develop a device only wants easy (interest) free loan. On Kickstarter I expect to find entrepreneurs/creators asking backers (customers) for help and to trust his enterprise and his persona to be capable to develop a great product and to deliver on a date (naive?). Should a creator miss a delivery date (it happens, no problem), then it's wise that an entrepeneur explains why the development is failing AND why shipment is missed AND comes up with a new development plan AND a delivery date to ask his trusting customers for an extension of the trust, otherwise his business will fail miserably keeping any customers. Should an entrepreneur prove - again and again - not being able to meet his own promises and - on top of that - refuses to show any proof that hours/money is spent on the project by showing an actual product(in development) and/or state a new delivery date, then - at some point - a customer / backer will seriously question the capabilities / intentions of that entrepreneur. Trustees feel cheated and betrayed when the entrepeneur spends time to write e-mails to order (pre) products or expand the current order and updates his website - clevery phrased implicating that delivery is soon to be expected - yet refuses to inform his trustees what the status is of the project and when they can expect the product when he fails to deliver on his on promises. Could you please explain why you have faith that the Stormtag is developed and will be delivered? Yes, I have noticed that Jon Atherton has changed the design multiple times which really drives up costs. It was clear before his confirmation that our funds have been depleted and that he is paying for it out of his own pocket, a fact that we should appreciate. He never needed the funds in the first place, but who would say no to an interest-free loan. I know some guys like the creators to be their "friends" and chit chat about every step of the production process. Well this isn't one of those projects, so just suck it up. I have confidence that Jon will deliver - eventually. It's a shame that such a potentially useful gadget has failed to reach users hands. Lots of outdoor people could find uses for it. Ideally I'd like it to have a colour change LED too, that went green when the conditions I wanted were due, (sunshine/snow/light winds etc) to amber (change) and red when they were unfavourable or a concern. The parameters set would be unique to each user, and could be edited via the app, so I could take the tag anywhere minus a phone. Various fixing options would also be useful, but this is all pie in the sky as I don't have a Storm tag. @Jon Thanks for the current updates. The firestorm of comments from people who have never been involved in the design process has been amusing, to say the least. Stuff happens. Adapt and overcome. Finish strong! You're doing good stuff~ @Jon. Thx. Is there a reason for changing the design John? I am interested in the choice @Creator: however it's NOT using surface-contacts either as you said you'r gonna use on April 2nd. I conclude that from April till October you've redesigned the StormTag (again) for whatever reason and caused the increased costs yourself, without even bothering to update your annoying investors / customers waiting for you to finally deliver on your many promises By addressing your own inconsistencies, does NOT give you any right to take my money without delivering the product, just because you don't like my tone (as you've done with other backers). You want us to respect you, then show some respect for your backers too with regular updates and a deliver the promised / backed product and behave as a trustworthy entrepreneur ready for more business and not as a child) @Dennis Dolman, the link where the picture is is shows an open usb-connector. That device is definitly not weatherproof and waterproof for outdoor use. Sorry. @Dennis: The picture of the "new" StormTag shows a standard female micro-usb slot (to recharge?) however in update 11 (<url>"I expect to ship during late May or early June"), therefore I suspect that this "new" StormTag-image is not from the actual product, hence this is no proof that John is working on the device. @Jørgen Not sure of that. It still proofs John is working on it! Keep up your work John :)! @Dennis: thanks Weird that this is showing an orange StormTag while the website states only white is available. Probably only a render of a StormTag and still no proof that a prototype exists Here's a screenshot :<url>"new" design (dropbox, google photo, photobucket) as I don't receive the "discount" offers and the website is not showing a new design either? Yeah I saw that email too! It looks totally different! So it looks like the design has drastically changed according to last 40% off email. Is this correct? @Jon Atheron - Dear Jon, if you don't want the hate campaign - just look at how some other campaigns handles delays. Take Bragi - almost a whole year delayed - but due to the way the Creator communicates - there are hardly any bad words there. So I do think most of your issues are of your own making. Creators who do not communicate gets slaughtered. Creators who DO communicate and show progress - gets promoted to angels and don't get the harsh comments you get. And for us as backers - to constantly get emails to buy your products - when they are not even shipping - looks like a bit fraudulent. So before you blame the backers - look towards yourself please - and change your attitude. That would help clear the air here. Start regular communications - show prototypes and progress and issues holding you back. Be honest. That is kind of the key ingredient in a delayed Kickstarter Campaign. Thanks for the update Remove the 'pre-order now' link. You are not delivering this product, and the link states that delivery will take place in August (201?) The survey sent out invited everyone to purchase more, which suggested that you had a manufactured delivery of goods to dispatch, which you don't. Marketing to people to buy goods you cannot supply is illegal in the UK Still haven't received my Storm Tag. What a joke. If the StormTag isn't completed soon it just might be outdated as there are similar solutions already shipping, like the 2n generation SensorTag by Texas Instrument packing a ton of sensors for about 30 bucks, supported by MyWeatherCenter on IOS: <url>"fan" page ;) <url>… Could we please get more detailed information about the next steps in your plan for getting the item shipped? I'm going to assume the "less expenses" equates to what I pledged, and - therefore - I will never see any reward or any refund. Not to mention it is very interesting to see Jon claim abuse when he has clearly abused our good faith. This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. Got the same email as a bunch of others. I'm done with this fraudster. @All: you have several options, including contacting your local legal authority dealing with these kind of issues like the Attorney General and Federal Trade Commission in the US. You can even take a layer and sure him but good luck on that end. *** Another option is to contact your credit card company and claim a refund (it is not typically the fraud department but the dispute department). You typically have 120 days from the promised date of delivery to make a claim. Then, the credit card company will contact the company that made the charge and they will have to prove, within typically 45 days, that they shipped the payed item, which obviously they can't prove add it was never delivered. Then, the credit card company will confirm the refund and that's it. You get all your money back. AND IT IS LEGAL. PLEASE NOTE that Kickstarter will suspend your current account from backing further projects and threaten you into cancelling the claim with your financial institution within ten days out you will never be able to back a project with that account, saying you are not pledging in good faith. I have tried to explain to them that, after supporting 168+ projects for over $10'000 this past year and only made two refund claims, that I was not abusive as most projects were late at best. They patronized me, insulted me and bullied me but I stood my grounds. DO NOT FOLD. You are using a legal means (as per Kickstarter's terms of use) to recuperate your funds from a fraud. They did suspend this account. After several emails with Kickstarter, I can confirm that they will NOT protect backers like us from fraudsters but will gladly protect scammers/fraudsters as they never denied this claim. My credit card company is actually looking into investigating Kickstarter for fraud themselves and bring the results of that investigation to the appropriate legal authorities... :/ If ever you do get this letter from Kickstarter, let me know at the email pvsks2015 at gmail(.com). I am currently working with different interest groups regarding Kickstarter Inc.'s denial of its legal obligation (being the funds collecters) toward us the backers and your experience in this matter will greatly help... Good luck to all. phil. Got another ! Jon Atherton says: Rich, A refund will be issued *less expenses* after we have shipped rewards to a our supporters. We're not going to send *rewards* to assholes who make inflammatory, derisive, abusive, or slanderous comments. Rewards will be sent to supporters, you aren't one any longer - please go bother somebody else. Hahaha Rich, you are a lucky guy.. I wouldn't want to be the one breaking the bad news buddy but by the time John ships his "product" we will all be leaving on planet Mars. This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. I received the same email. What a scammer!!!!!! @Rich DiBuo it says he will refund you when they ship the product. If they never ship you will still receive no refund. This user's account has been deleted. Found out how to get a refund!!!! Just got this email!!! Jon Atherton says: Rich, Your comments on Kickstarter have been noted. The tone of your comments are regrettable, and we can no longer count you as a supporter. We now have no option but to terminate your reward and issue a refund. The refund less expenses, will be made within 30 days of the rewards shipping to our supporters. Who is Adam Burck btw? Click on Jon's face and "Adam Burck" has verified his ID through automated process... At this rate they will not have to produce a single stormtag... maybe thats the idea?! Also nothing in my lost was offensive just inquisitive yet you no longer get a reward... This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. I was never asking for a refund and I just got this as well. "Nick, Your comments on Kickstarter have been noted. The tone of your comments are regrettable, and we can no longer count you as a supporter. We now have no option but to terminate your reward and issue a refund. The refund less expenses, will be made within 30 days of the rewards shipping to our supporters" So folks. Be kind to Jon otherwise, he will punish you and he will not send you the item for which you have paid! Peter, Your comments on Kickstarter have been noted. The tone of your comments are regrettable, and we can no longer count you as a supporter. We now have no option but to terminate your reward and issue a refund. The refund less expenses, will be made within 30 days of the rewards shipping to our supporters. Just received this email from Mr Atherton through Kickstarter: "Jon Atherton says: Alain, Your comments on Kickstarter have been noted. The tone of your comments are regrettable, and we can no longer count you as a supporter. We now have no option but to terminate your reward and issue a refund. The refund less expenses, will be made within 30 days of the rewards shipping to our supporters." I'm starting to agree here. Projected ended last July and yet still no product. Periods of months at a time without an update and then hey here's a useless update which tells you nothing at all! This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. Well that updates was nothing but a sad attempt at lip service. Shoulda spent ten more minutes on what's really going on. The people who haven't replied are more likely over this whole project. Maybe next year sometime... (Not holding my breathe) Perhaps we should talk to the Attorney General or the FTC. see articles below <url>"Important Message Service Disputes cannot be filed after 105 days from the transaction date , transaction date is :25 7 2014" Going to go to credit card company next. I wonder how much money a kickstarter campaign to raise funds to prosecute this guy would raise... All of this seems really bad. I say we lobby a lawsuit against this guy and get our money back. If anyone knows a lawyer who can take this on, I'm very interested in pursuing this. This guy's track record does nothing to boost my confidence in this matter. Seems this is past Amazon's refund period of 105 days, so those of us that paid this way are out of luck. I emailed him twice and no response. I agree with the other comments that this joker is a rip off. This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. Shipping in July? What planet do you live on where July hasn't come yet. It is September in my part of the world and no StormTag! Anyone know how to get a refund? I paid via Amazon whenever this damn project was first funded. This guy is a joke. If it's not happening just have the balls to tell us sorry you ran out of money. Would be better then waiting around. Really disappointed. This user's account has been deleted. No delivery schedule, just another Yufu offer email from this piss take masquerading as a Kickstarter project. This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. This whole thing has been a scam. He got people off his back for a while with his last stunt but a skunk can't change his stripe. I would be surprised if we ever see anything. Might be time to engage law enforcement to investigate fraud. Who's up for that? [cynical mode] Today is the day that Jon Atherton will bring 2268 packages to the post-office. [/cynical mode] Jon what happened to this? This is from Campaign and risks were small! Why is it taking so long if you had working units 14+ months ago? Project Risks: 1. Design. We have completed a full design program - the enclosure is relatively straight forward, water proofing will present some challenges but we are confident this can be completed. 2. Electronics & Software. The PCB design is complete, and operational. There are some minor adjustments required. We will ship this with an update to the HEX3 SDK. Our App partner is WeatherSignal.com who have agreed to build iOS and Android Apps to support StormTag. 3. Manufacturing partner. We have identified a strong manufacturing partner. assuming we are successful we'll travel to meet with them and finalise the manufacturing schedule in the 3 weeks following the completion of the Kickstarter completion. We also have strong relationships with other factories if required. 4. Distribution. We currently work with one of the larger 3PL companies and we utilise warehouses in Hong Kong, UK, and 2 in the USA - LA and PA. We do not consider distribution a risk, although managing the flow of product doesn't always run smoothly, we understand what is required. 5. There are always unforeseen circumstances, but we do not think that this project is very high risk. We have working units and have the experience to deliver. On Hex3.co when ordering a StormTag it's stated "Only available in white. Orders received today will ship in August." - so I'll just wait another 4 days - YEAH!!! @Paul Collins the Storm Tag 'will be happening' as to email incentive offers without any intention to deliver would be illegal. Just waiting for a delivery schedule..... Hi Jon, I have waited patiently as I know that these kickstarter projects do take time. I'm concerned as to why you are not responding to anyone's messages. Money has been handed over a considerable time ago now. You logged in yesterday and still haven't let anyone know, even if you tell people that this stormtag is not happening I think people have the right to know. I hope to hear from you soon. Regards Paul @Keith - LOL we don't need an update - we need StormTags to be shipped before the human race gains Atmokinesis We need another update. Last chance survey was five weeks ago. What's happening now? IfYou are lucky if you have made payment via PayPal, you can easily return it using their service. But others, who belived him many many month ago...can not do taht now, because 6 month left from the date of payment. Watch out!! This person Jon Atherton looks like being a fraude. I kickstarted this project and after closing we got very little updates. This person is in now way responding to any email you sent him, neither through kickstarter or his own website HEX3.COM. After started kickstarting this project you receive various emails with interesting sales. When ordering one of these offers they collect there payments through Paypal but never sent any of the ordered goods. Again no response to over 5 emails I sent. They even got the nerves to sent me months later the same sales email for the same product I already ordered. Again no respons to any email as a reply of the sales email nor through his website. THIS IS JUST ONE FRAUD!! I rather spent my money at other more reliable kickstarter projects and there persons. I think we can safely say this is one big con just like the aclock which has vanished into thin air. This was the first project i backed on kickstarter, luckily it didn't put me off backing other projects because i've backed quite a few since this and all have been in a different league with updates and actually producing a product. Its a shame that people like Jon aren't held accountable for their actions or in this case non action!! I find it deeply disrespectful to keep hammering us with discount codes to buy more products that will never see the light of day.....just concentrate on fulfilling the original orders. @Marko Wagner, I think what we all need to understand is that Jon doesn't care what we think or feel - he has our money just like the Yufu and clock backers so he achieved his goal. He has made it clear that we don't deserve information, responses, respect or updates so game set and match to spam boi. I wonder if the apologists for Jon are still holding their breath for a miracle? JON, WHERE THE F**K IS THE DELIVERY AND THE UPDATES ?!?! Jon I wonder what is so difficult for you to understand that YOUR backers TRUSTED you and GAVE you THEIR money now WANT to see updates?? Personally I've given up on this guy and his project. I'm writing it off as a loss. I ordered weather point 2.0, the project leader communicates regularly and answers all questions promptly. Still no delivery, WTF Why is nothing happening here Getting over the STORM Jon, I posted a message on kickstarter the 10th of August. You looged in at the 11th of August. Why is there no reaction on my message, or any of them. This is not my first one that i wrote to you. I think and many other backers think the same. You treat us and your project like crap. This is not the way you treat people. Here is a saying for you: "Treat people the way, you would be treated" It's been around a month that there was an update. About shipping if im right. The update before theat was about the way you can charge the StormTag, if there is actually one to charge. But inbetween there was no update or anything about the stormtag itself, Im guessing, correct me if i'm wrong. There is no finished product yet and im getting the feeling there will be no product in the future as well. I hope im wrong about that and you can deliver were we paid for. Yours sincerely, Koen van den Hurck Ridiculous This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. it's been a while since we heard something from you Jon. Can you give us an update about the shipping date. Stop sending emails from your company to order stormtags with discount. First handle our Kickstarter requests before the rest. Jon, you have lucrative international orders to fulfill with the production of the Storm Tag. No need to send offer emails to backers, you have bigger fish to fry. Send out the Storm Tags to backers and lets all move on. even after 3 weeks the StormTags are NOT shipped (according to BackerKit) At least my recent CC-charge for additional Stormtags can be used to report this fraude More spam email and no product in hand! I know you said you would ship soon but you spam my inbox more than you update us @Dongjin Kim it's a reasonable enquiry that lacks an answer @Creator Any update regarding shipping? I guess he wil ship in one or two weeks. He have to pack all orders and the due date of surveys are 4 days ago. I have some faith restored in John Looks like WeatherSignal is still listing StormTag in there application description, so maybe we are nearing completion there too. <url>#584. Jon is my money gone? My first scammed campaign I guess... I was lucky to get my money back from my indigogo HealBe flop... I had high hopes kickstarter wasn't gonna have any flakes like this :( " Thanks to our wonderful backers, StormTag will begin shipping in November 2014. ... Funding period: Jun 11 2014 - Jul 25 2014 (44 days) ... Risks and challenges ... 5. There are always unforeseen circumstances, but we do not think that this project is very high risk. We have working units and have the experience to deliver." Only 11 more days until it's been a FULL YEAR since I handed over my money and even after 7 months of delays still nothing has been shipped. John's texts from the campaign-page are painful to reread ... Why my comment was deleted? Just say that our money disappered. This user's account has been deleted. The A-Clock porject has been removed from his www.hex3.co website. So that money has vapourised. Hey Creator why don't you be a man and step up and say sorry folks I can't make it happen and the we can all move on. This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. Questionable Crowdfunding Campaigns May Be New Easy Money For Scammers « CBS San Francisco <url>"I expect to ship during late May or early June. Next update will be just prior to production." On June 30th, still no news. Jon Atherton, you are either a crook or the worst project manager this planet has ever seen! Development of new products can be hard but please inform the people who want to help by backing this project about your progress. Saatanan tunarit Jon, I m not sure whether you actually are working on this, whether this is just a case of a failed project, or if there ever was a product to begin with. Regardless, the likelihood is you won't be delivering. Your updates, like some other projects, will probably go sparse even more and one day you will tell us you are pulling the plug on the project. In case that is your plan, know that there is One God who knows everything we do/don't-do/say/don't-say/feel and has records on every single thing in this world. Our deeds are being recorded like an Super duper HD camera that is always on. Also know that life in this world is only temporary, and a test. Today you have hurt over 2,000 people by eating their hard earned money in the promise you made. Don't sell your soul, Jon. It isn't too late. God forgives all sins, as long as you repent, admitting your mistake and never repeat again. You can cheat us, but not God. We are all ultimately returning to Him, so fix this now before He personally judges between us on the Day of Judgment. This $120K won't help you for too long in this world, but it will certainly become a huge burden on you in the Hereafter. We all will probably move on, but have you thought of what God's justice will be like for you on Judgement Day? Please help yourself and return our money. If you can't return, then at least come clean. Dear John, do you have any news or prod/shipment updates for us ?

I'm starting to lose hope to see this product in my hands. Sorry to sound negative... This guy is sending out 40% off of his "products" emails and he has yet to deliver on anything. Are there any lawyers in the crowd? Where are the updates??? Some pictures of the actual device would be appreciated and at this point are expected, especially since we are months past due for the Stormtag to be finished. Also these hex3 emails are really annoying when you can't even deliver on this product. I like others would just like to see/hear how work is going, and not just "i'm working or random photos of usb devices" You said shipping late May or early June. Its now June 3rd and still no update on shipping or update on anything! As no update i am guess that production still has not started. I don't mind offer updates, just like evidence of the products to support them We work hard to keep our system clean, but we count on our customers to pitch in too. You may not: Send Spam. By "spam," we mean the definition on the Spamhaus website. In short, spam is "unsolicited bulk email." John, When you are terribly late on your deadline frequent updates are needed. Remember we gave you funds for a project. Also mail chimp requires your lists opt in per their TOS. We have not done so and you have breached said agreement with them. <url>"I expect to ship during late May or early June. Next update will be just prior to production." An update would be nice Hi Jon, We are just hoping that your heart does not only beat once every two months for this project! Regular input, even if it is only to hear the heart beating, is the only way for us, backers, to feel the project is still alive. Thanks for your efforts. Eager to get some news soon. KR It is, yes, absolutely reasonable for backers to expect way more than a 'I'm working on it'. We're waiting for the product to get to our homes. @Jon, thanks for the update. It is appreciated, but … I don't think it unreasonable for backers to expect a little more than a 'I'm working on it'. This isn't your hex3 store, this is kickstarter where we've committed to being involved, albeit 'only' financially, in the development of what we saw as an exciting new product. Remind yourself what Kickstarter themselves suggest when it comes to updates: "Treat your project like a story that’s unfolding before their eyes. Detailed updates like “Pics from last night’s show!” or “We found a printer for our book!” are fun for everybody to follow along with." We _want_ to follow along. I think Richard Baran's request is fair, and would placate and indeed interest backers. Where is the development/manufacturing process up to? Your marketing email mentioned you were due to place an[other] order with the factory: what was that for? I agree with you that "heartbeat" updates aren't necessary, but proving there is still a pulse is! This user's account has been deleted. Is this straight up a scam? Do you have any proof you are actually moving forward with this? Maybe a parts order invoice (feel free to blank out the costs)? Maybe pictures of the current model (not a random usb drive)? Maybe a letter from one of your distributes? Also the attitude of the project owner is very poor, people are pissed because it seems like you are lying and just dragging this on. If its a scam just let us know, and then we can move on from this. Same idea for the YuFu any real updates on this? My guess is no. How about an update? How about an unique update just for StormTag, and not a 'cut 'n' paste' from Yufu? appreciate you office types are hunched over your computers, but some of us like the outdoors, swimming sailing, surfing, cycling... that kind of stuff. In the UK it's summer and a Storm Tag might be useful. I mentioned mounting options, for fixing a Storm Tag to bikes, any progress with that? Rather than threaten your backer with that excellent legal resource called Wikipedia why don't you refund those dissatisfied with your lack of delivery? Plus I truly LOVE that if you ask a question on his Twitter account you get immediately BLOCKED! I can understand the upset people and I am truly upset too. It is not the waiting that is upsetting people, it is the lack of information, updates, and overall lack of caring for the customer that the creator is doing. Not to mention that he is getting some press for being "shady" in other areas and truly not communicative in the least bit Whatever this project might look like: please be as polite as possible. Thanks. And yes, I'm a bit upset, too – but I know it's impossible to speed things up by posting angry comments. Good thing I have friends at mail chimp. Let them know you are running a scam. You dishonorable price of unless trash. Spam boi is really working up a storm lately...how about an update Jon Another morning, another spam email. You're just taking the piss now, Jon. When's the shipping update due? oh yeah, where's my chequebook ... have to admire his cheek! Still that's how they operate, that's how they get rich, never realised I could be so gullible! But he is placing his next order with the factory. I still must recieve a Nota (pen) apart form ..... He sure is dilligent and active: raising money. This: <url>"near the end of May, or early June", then that means the production line must be running now. What is my order number in a line of 2000+ backers? Looks like he has taken off with our money! Jon has not logged in for almost 2 months.... Looks like crickets chirping again..... Any news? SITREP? Any news? Awfull silence for months now! @Alex Danson I still have hope but less then a few months ago. Due to the fact that updates aren't frequently as people request. In my case Jon didn't respond to several emails and messages i sent to him. Not only me but several other backers of this project. That's the reason people want a refund and say it is a scam. I will wait till the late May, early June to see if he can deliver. So let's hope. WEZR - The Industry's Most Precise Weather Tracker <url>"nothing" from Jon. Its Wednesday! can't wait for an update! :) I wait with bated breath for the update. @Paul Pleijs. Er komt een windmolentje in. Ha. Thanks Jon, i'll wait... good luck... This user's account has been deleted. @Ryan Hetzer +1 more nothing's from Jon End of the week is coming. Let hope that Jon can commit to his update notice. Again with the email to buy Jon. Special gift being what; Never deliver or I don't care about paying customers? Why dont we start a class act against John? It's a shame that Storm Tag and Yufu are taking so long to deliver to your backers. It means no one is reasonably going to make another pre-order or back another of your ideas until they are. I won't bother asking how much longer this will take either. JA - if you cared about your KS backers you'd give us updates, you'd give us your timeline, you'd answer emails here and via your website, you wouldn't "ban" anyone daring to ask a reasonable question via twitter and most importantly you'd deliver. I believe it has been a worthwhile lesson, much cheaper than those gentlemen from the ski resort paid. Yes @W. Laving if I see anything more in the press I will update you and others. There's no smoke without a fire. Thank you for informing us @Paul OConner. Will you keep us informed? And I agree with @Christopher McKain and @Dennis Dolman. And Jon I am willing to believe that you care about your Kickstarter projects. So lift your radiosilence and tell us in what stage your projects are! You've not responded to any messages but responded to that??? @Jon why do you reply on this matter and not on any other questions from backers? This user's account has been deleted. This user's account has been deleted. This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. You are almost 5 months overdue and only have shown us something that a 12 year old can solder together in 5 minutes. Shame on you John Atherton! Hi Jon, thanks for the update. I've full understanding of such problems, which are often complex. But please bring the folk quick update's, even if it goes down at high stress. It helps! I wish a lot success for an early release. Greetz from Germany... What about some pictures? You know, cause "pics or it didnt happen". Thanks for the offer email. More frequent updates, a delivery schedule and evidence of a working product may sway my decision in favour of a purchase. Please, just send a simple update like that one every couple of weeks? Doing so would help satisfy my concern that work on the project is ongoing. I want the project to succeed, but the lack of updates from you is disheartening. An update and an e-mail hawking his other products. Fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me. Kickstarter has gotten to be like gambling in Vegas you kind of figure that if you go you can pretty much kiss your money good bye thing is when I gamble I get the fun of playing when I pledge on Kickstarter I get SCREWED! Don't get too excited. The update only told us to wait for more delays..... holly hell we got an update has anyone contacted the authorities and filed a fraud report? 2 months and no update. Last update said you were changing to a local engineering team for better communication. I hope you are communicating better with engineering team than you are will your 2,000+ backers. CON MAN Hi John, this is my 2nd request for a monthly status update! Why didn't you give us any progress update for so long? I expect you to inform me and the other backers on the current project status! Another month without any info from you, forces me to reconsider my pledge in this project. there is this site <url>"StormTag is the smallest most accurate weather sensor available. (The product we are shipping is the same as the StormTag+ first shown on Kickstarter.)" LOL....then I scroll down to number 5 and see the mysitcal Stormtag....hmmm <url>"and whilst you and all the other Kickstarter backers are incredibly important - worldwide sales is where I earn my income - this isn't a hobby" What does that mean for Kickstarters? you could tweet him Jon Atherton @tunes probably won't do any good though Looong Gooooone! Any status update on this? And for that matter how about the Yufu pen? Jon, Any thing happen in last month and a half? please! Dear Jon, Can you please update us ? Regards, <url>è che riesci a rimborsare i soldi che tutti noi ti abbiamo dato,grazie Jon Atherton. Have rewards been shipped, haven't seen one yet? Now that this is back on track, please consider Storm Tag mount options. Considering something to attach to a window car/house and maybe a bike handlebar mount, so that I can take it with me. Accessories are useful Thanks for the update. I still want my refund. Go Jon go!!! Thank you for the update, Jon! I too would like more frequent updates, even if it's just to say you're still working on it. Glad to see things are starting to progress with this project, it's understandable to have delays with new products. It would be nice to have more frequent updates though just to put everyone at ease......even if it's just to say that there have been some issues which have slowed everything down :0) P.S. i'm still holding out hope on the aclock........update on that would be great Thanks for the update Jon, understand cultural difference makes your challenge even harder than expected ! Keep us updated on ETD of StormTag ! Thank you for the update please keep them coming more frequently. I think a lot of us understand that there are challenges bringing a new product to market but we will not tolerate radio silence. I look forward to the next update which hopefully will include a tentative delivery date. A couple of days i got an email of HEX3 (his business) to get discount on products he is selling. One of those products is the StormTag, so i wrote Mr Atherton an email, so far no response. Anybody else a reactionfrom Mr. Atherton so far? Complaint filed with Kickstarter due to no updates within the last 30 days. Very disappointing that Kickstarter does not appear to care. I'm going to give Mr. Atherton until the end of the week to post some sort of update or else I am seeking a refund. It is too bad that it has come to this. We need an update on where the project is going... Very late delivery now, which is ok if the communication is prompt. Please provide update! I'm following MK's lead. I did the same. Attempted to email this guy back in December and still nothing. Clearly the pattern of behavior is to scam people so I just filed with my CC company as well. Strange that John *is* responding to questions in his other KS project (YuFu). I suspect that the stormtag won't be delivered in 2015.... Thats why I bailed out and filed a complaint at my credit card issuer. I *did* get a refund! You have time to write comments on another project over the last three days calling someone a "troll" and arguing with that same person yet no update? I don't think searching wiki articles is the best use of your time. I think we found the real "troll." Sorry John, I'm bailing out. You gave no response and did not reply to my messages. I filed a complaint at my credit card company. You can kiss your money goodbye on this one. He'll be on a sunny beach sipping his G&T at our expense as he reads these messages. Yet this site takes no action to assist recovering money ... shame on your kickstarter; it will be your own demise unless you are seen to be assisting. Sends out an email offering 40% off storewide for a product which has no update since October. He has fooled his backers and continues by sending them mails with offers! Needs to be communication on the status of this kickstarter, its January and the last update was October. Please write at least one sentence with its status, thank you. It's really amazing receive a e-mail with an offer when we do not have news about the product that we have backed. I hope to receive some news asap. What a shame - getting an email saying I can buy the product that I pledged to get off the ground, but no sign of the product that I've given $53 dollars to get............ And no updates here. Odd. Hay so I'm not sure what's going on but I got an email today offering me 40% off my perches of any of the items on the company's website, and that includes this storm tag that they say on the website was funded by Kickstarter, the email instigated that the backers had already been rewarded and the great sale was what was left over, that's why I looked here to see if other backers had gotten the there's I guess I'm not the only one whom has not gotten mine yet. I agree he needs to update us I have backed this group before and they have been pretty good about updates, and timely fulfillment. hopefully when we get it, it will be a good one All please report this project and the scam artist behind this abuse of Kickstarter policy on communication and project delivery status! I just googled them from the address listed in the email. It has a phone number on it. I'll try to give them a call tomorrow. I just got an email from HEX3 (Mr. Atherton's company) giving me a discount code for 40% off any of their products "as a thank you for being a backer of one of our previous projects". Mr. Atherton, please explain to me why I should trust you with more of my money, when you can't even show us the courtesy of an update (after over two months of waiting!), or give a reply to the two private messages I've sent you? You know what a proper thank you would be for being a backer? Giving us the update we deserve. I'll give you until Monday. Otherwise, I will file a claim with the Better Business Bureau, and urge other backers to do the same. Just trying to find out what's happening... Update needed! It's been 3 months.... I'm going to finally chime in. At this point I'd like my money back. I have backed other kickstarters and have had delivery on most. This is unacceptable. Either post and pronounce or give the money back. ? I'd love an update... even if it's bad news, please give us an update. � There was an update about his other project YuFu, so hopefully one here soon . Unfortunately, Kickstarter's rules do not have anything to say about providing regular updates to backers. Maybe it's about time they did; so as to prevent unethical behavior such as Jon Atherton's. Please take 60 seconds to type one sentence on the status of this project or delegate the task. Any hopes of launching new products go further down the drain every day you leave your current backers hung out to dry. Is there a way to get our money back? It has been too long without any update or any response to valid inquiries so I also reported this to Kickstarter. Hi Jon, do you live well from your backers money? Same here as with YuFu, your other Kickstarter project, being delayed since April 2014: Taking money without delivery, not even some communications on a regular basis. To me, this sounds like fraud, meanwhile. I think this post is more respectful and considerate than Jon is... Where is my storm tag Jon?? You took my money and promised a product which I am yet to put my hands on.. Worst is the last time I heard from you was nearly 3 months ago!! Well, I am now on my trip I bought this for... How about a update...? Do you have an update on shipping? You promised late dec/jan delivery. Thanks Reported to Kickstarter. Project delays are acceptable, but total radio silence is not! Jon seems to have time to upload a video to vimeo, but not to post any updates to his own kickstarter projects. Just sent a note to Jon requesting an update as well as a note to Kickstarter stating there had been no communication in regards to this project. Very disappointed in the lack of response to all of us backers of the project. Like everyone else I am very disappointed, there has been no communication and no updates and we are well past the expected delivery date. I´m very disappointed, no communication at all :( Just give us an ETA that's it ! February March ? no communication here, no communication via twitter, no communication via facebook, no communication from website - in my book that means either the guy has dropped down dead or is committing fraud; plus this site carefully steps aside and offers no hope or help. My next stop is www.IC3.gov Reported to Kickstarter. No communication what so ever and no updates. Please send an update by mid January. This is ridiculous the lack of communication. I've got no problem with being late, it's about a month late right now, but if you're late, you need to communicate why. I also preorder a product from his webpage hex3.co 4 months ago and no answer... By the way, somebody should sue this guy at US. He mentions KS campaigns in his page that do not exist and never have!!! KS should make an update about the situation of this project. Still no update?? Reported again with my last request on OCT29. Come on now Jon.. Sure would be nice with a survey soon The last update was that he was testing the latest design and would be back to us in a few days. The project is also set for delivery Nov/Dec. Considering that backers supported Storm Tag because we liked the idea of contributing weather data, and getting our own local forecast, you would guess we were behind the project idea. Good communication is part of business, and considering he has'nt updated us a promised, delivery is late and no doubt he has finished work for the Xmas break, the creator would take the time to let us know what is actually happening. It would be a shame to lose project support, when the idea has so much promise. I'd back his jaja stylus awhile ago and it delivered about a month after the due date but at that time he o my had two projects working at a time. He did much better communicating back then. I will be patient a little longer...till the new year and then I'll hit the report link. Still without update... I have also reported this project to Kickstarter. Hope this gets the communication started again. I reported the project to Kickstarter. Hopefully they do something about it. This guys got three overdue projects and he's not updating any of them, and the best he can do is to send spam to try and sell his other overdue projects. My guess is that he has run out of money and has nowhere to turn to. Sadly this is my first kickstarter fail, I hope it's my last - I don't need to waste money on clowns like this guy. There was so much enthusiasm about this project by Jon and then it faceplanted. What is going on. No news, is good news does not work well for Kickstarter projects. Unexpectedly I received a reply to an email to Jon within 2 hours: Thanks Paul, I will do an update soon, when I have some worthwhile information to pass on. Regards Jon Atherton I just kicked this project for lack of communication I have reported the project, others please do the same! I think it's enough for me. Time to report this project to kickstarter. There is a "report" button at the bottom of the project page, maybe if enough of us hit it, Kickstarter will kick Jon. He would have had to have given postal & bank information to start the project. The creator has not logged in since November 3rd, he's not reading your comments. Hopefully an update soon. Is Jon still alive? No update at all. Where is our Stormtag?? Please inform us! Looked so Nice, but worst project ever, no communication and no respect for the backers. I feel scammed!! Updates please As you bank for a reversal of charges. Kickstarter was a good concept but as of late too many fraud artists and people who have no clue about customer service. Right now my backings are paying off 50% of the time. I think I have had it with Kickstarter as they seem to have no interest in self policing. Hi Jon, is there any update as it has been 29 days since any communication and at that point you said you would update is in a few days. No news is... good/bad news? updates please! Updates please!! Updates please Updates please Update please! any updates Jon? Please.. perhaps he was inspired by the steve miller bands 1976 single? music has been blamed for worse. I backed 2 of the projects of Mr. Atherton. The Yufu, estimated delivery: May 2014. And Stormtag, estimated delivery: Nov 2014. I agree, it’s the second week of December. But looking at the way that Yufu is going, I wouldn’t be surprised if both projects fail to deliver. A total of about $ 250.000 that backers donated. A nice profit, it seems. Well done, Mr. Atherton. Is there any updates? Hi Jon, Can you update us on the statuts of Stormtag ? thanks :) @Dennis .. well if not him someone did using his account! Did he block you David? Blocking people on your twitter account that politely ask questions says a lot about your customer service and care. We can all live with bad news but no news and ignoring us is simply rude and I have to question your motive in raising these monies. Please give your backers some respect and write some short and regular updates, even if it is to say that items have not been delivered yet. We, backers have put more than 100'000 $ in this project so we deserve some regular information. To come to the forum to write that an update will come very soon and disappear again for weeks is not the best way to give us confidence in this project. It's being a long time since the last update. That's not the way you should deal with your supporters... Communication is key. There is no update until october. All the projects that I pledged in kicstarter has delays but they keep inform us about timig delays and reasons. If I need to score the user support of this campaign would be 1 of 5. For that reason I don't recommend and either support more Jon Atherton project's In the project details it says that the Storm tag shares a lot of the electronics with YuFu, thus saving time and development costs. Unfortunately YuFu has been delayed with technical problems, and I guess that those problems also become Storm tag problems too. How much work would it be to give a quick update about once every week ? Maybe 5 minutes work ? You could do some multitasking and do it when you brush your teeth ? That would have made most your backers happy and more than ok with delays and other unforeseen issues. Instead you go for "radio silence" and you end up being the bad guy. I know for a fact that I don't trust you at all anymore, and I know I'm not the only one. I am happy I didn't bye into the YuFu to, like a lot of other backers did ! ever the eternal optimist, even I am feeling abused. Where is the promissed update? 18 november is more than a few days ago Be useful to have a choice of fixing options. Maybe a bike mount, with a parameter set in the app to make the Storm Tag beep on demand in response to weather changes UV, storms etc I also would like to hear from the creater about the status. Please do not leave us hanging. Any news are okay Over a month since the last update, can we please get a status update? Shipping of late Dec/Jan still applicable? Hello, As a backer of your Storm Tag project, I am inquiring as to the status of the shipping date of the Storm Tag Sincerely, Rick Michaels I just found project "Climate" It looks the same tot me ! Please please please may we have an update? There is a "report" button at the bottom of the project page, if you're dissatisfied, you can click it. However, I suspect from these comments that multiple clicks have already had an impact, since Jon says an update is forthcoming. Let's at least give him until 12/1. Full update "in a few days" - 8 days and no news .... did I? Mr. Badaginski compares Jon Atherton with ford, edison and leatherman! I think that Mr. Bagadinski isn't a backer of YuFu, another great Atherton Project! I.m cynical about both! I would be surprised if I will ever receive either the YuFu or the Storm Tag! "There will be a full update in a few days" ~ one week later eh? OMG! ROTFLMAO! Betcha all you impatient crainialrectal types don't tip the waitstaff if your nummy numnyms is 5 min late too! thank goodness you wern't around during ford, edison, leatherman ( his took years to develope) time. I'd rather it be good than fast. I also got a Climate at the same time. Eats batteries and uv sensor doesn't work because it was rushed to get out Need an update, please. Sounded so exciting a long long time ago... Have filed a reversal of charges with my credit card provider. The lack of respect for Kickstarter backers is totally unacceptable. I suggest all other disrespected backers do the same. Fraud is a crime. Seem we have professional whiners amongst us. Thomas Edison tactics at work <url>"kickstarter spirit", with frequent updates - it felt more like a preorder. So I knew what to expect this time, but I can imagine why others are disappointed. After receiving the update from Jon Atherton this morning I came here to read the comments. After I saw that there were no positive comments I read the comments from his other campaigns. Now I'm worried. There were no positive comments there either. Backing a project requires regular updates, else it just becomes an overdue mail order purchase. WHY OH WHY does kickstarter not have consumer protection like Amazon and Ebay and paypal? Kickstarter should start using Papay and then when this happens paypal can take back out money out of his account- looking at the awards in his 7 projects we have made him rich. I BACKED TWO and feel really taken . He doesn't give a rip about backers. He got his money and that is ALL he is interested in. Very obvious at this point. Maybe in the future if he starts another project some of us should spend a buck and chime in to warn everybody. but... An update is always welcome Developers on some other projects are having bluetooth connectivity problems with the apps. Perhaps it is the same here. Has Jon abbandoned the project or is he just ignoring his backers/funders. Somewhere in the past his somebody "telling that she was his wife" that Jon was very busy. Can she do the updates of his projects on his behalve! I don't know if that comment was made on this StormTag-project or the Yufu-stylus project. <url>"WeatherSignal" is the name of the app. It's currently available for android only. generic weather signal app ...... and what might that be?? Update us please ! June 25th I received a special coupon. I bought 2 Stylus. They are not shipped yet! I backed this project and the aClock. (aClock is not on kickstarter but on to be found on Crowdtilts.) Yes I received another coupon today, but no answers or updates on his projects. And the latter is giving my bad thoughts. Just got a special 15 hour off coupon from them?? If they can figure out how to send coupons out - they should be able to figure out how to update backers - if this is not a TOTAL SCAM Guess the electronics were sent to you via DHL Turtle.... No tracking, no updates.... Get emails for his other projects biweekly. Guess he expects me to back those as well?! We will be lucky to see this project close by this time next year. Expect the worst, hope for the best and you have THIS GUY!! I just ask a question. What is happening. People on the <url>"still waiting". If it helps alleviate any fears, I've back one (Jaja) of Jon's several Kickstarter campaigns. Jon has not failed to deliver so far. Lots of goodwill from my side that this will be no different. A bonus is that StormTag works with the generic weather signal app that you can already download. It is just a case of ensuring the tag works reliably with the app. I'd assume that it does work, or this wouldn't be a project. Just need to know current status. So, what are we looking as a projected delivery date? Oh dear. Jon, please don't let this go the way of the Kreyos Meteor and the Lima websharing widget! I have great faith in a fellow Aussie pulling this off. Please do not disappoint us all! I'm hanging in there for you. Please deliver. At least TELL us something? In anticipation... Foxxy. Jon, how are things going? Jon, haven't you received the electronics yet? 2 months since last update. Can we please hear from you on the progress of StormTags? From a project management standpoint, it doesn't hurt to have a weekly message here at the comments section from @Creator. Newsworthy or not, you asked for $17,500, we gave you $112,082. Making a 5 minute comment once a week to the entire group hardly means wasting your time on answering each and every comment here. Any update?? I backed a project and this is not a project. No communication and nothing goes like planned. How's the electronics testing going? Have you considered adding this to IFTTT it would expand the possibilities and make this more valuable to have. This could be a trigger for IFTTT IFTTT.com @Marco you've not placed an order. You've backed a project and there's no canceling after the funding period has ended. How can i cancel the order? So I am confused you can send me marketing emails but not an update on the product? Hi Jon, on September 6th you say: "Monitoring comments here is a huge drain on my time, I'd rather be working on product - which I do 7 days a week, 12-14 hours a day. I'll post an update when there is some news worthy of an update". Does that mean you don't work on other projects like the aClock and Stormtag. Does that mean they are getting delayed too! I would be nice to your backers if you took an hour from your work to communicate with your backers. Take some pictures, say something about your products, just show us that you are taking a pride in working with your products. You showing your pride makes us funders/backers happy. Give us a feeling of being part of your family of products too. Have a look at his other projects. He's very silent there as well and some people are really upset there – I didn't read everything because it tires me. But what I read was: chances are good that we'll miss the release date by a few months. Nothing unusual for a Kickstarter project :-) Update Plz? Update please Any update???!?!?! Reading Update 6, this is one friend you need to get in touch <url>"real" content on your progress, soon? How about a factory tour, or maybe a "here's where we're at" sneak-peak at something? Thank you! Looking forward to getting them... Is it the same battery in the PRO and plus model now then? Hence the only difference is that you can charge the Pro model with solar power? Anyway. In upptagning my plus to a pro when we get the pledge manager I assume the $60 is the retail price, so they are probably just extending the Kickstarter price to all of their previous backers of all their products to bump up more orders. Got a mail today with a discount of 40%. So here $35, and thru mail $59,90 minus 40% is $35,94. I find this a bit strange. Can you please explain? Be interesting if the app showed how many storm tags were active in my area/County as more tags means better forecasting. So Jon that's a verry nice update :) Is it possible to take it on a dive trip? To see a pressure chart I have to say I really appreciate the latest update about the rechargeable battery. This really shows that StormTag is designed to last! So glad I backed this project @jon Atherton Hello Jon, is it planed, to add the PRO function into the choices in the survey? Thanks ... Klaus ... Hi may I ask where I can input the shipping details and make choices? Hi Jon! I think there'd be a lot of happy people to get some kind of update on the status of this project. What's the haps? So any updates now its been a few weeks since funding ? Just thought of another idea, use one to use as the main thermometer reading for a "SMART" thermostat like Nest. Our current thermostats are not placed great in our house and I always wanted to base the thermostat on the temperature of a bedroom, not a hallway Me neither Matt.. I thought he only took a weekend off I would love to see an update post-funding date. I dont like the pump pump pump, fund, then silence. Guys, there are more than three (3!) months to go… Can you present a countdown for delivery.? Any update? congrats first for being funded – curious about all the integration stuff awaiting us. well, i couldn't see any possibility of choosing my favorite colors for the strom tag+. will we later be provided with an option for picking the colors? :-) cheers from germany @jon first of all, congratulations on another successful project! this one has me really excited with the possibilities. once i get to install them on the island, i'll keep you posted on how it goes. i'm also interested in the stormtag api; i do a bit of ios development on the side and will love to see how i can use the api initially for my own personal needs :) cheers matthew I should have upgraded to a PRO... ahh well, too late now I guess. Congratulations! And i can't wait! Yes Came on Congratulations with the stormtag ;-) If left outside in the sun or shade, is there any notable difference in temp readings in black or white units? Is it best to keep outdoor units in direct sun or shade? Congratulation @jon i wish! mind you if it were near to singapore, then there would be less need for the stormtag; here there's just two seasons: hot, humid and rain & hot, humid and even more rain! it's actually in the more affordable region just off the coast of nova scotia ;) it also has a proper set of four seasons. given it's remoteness and distance from me, the 2 year logging and solar features of the stormtag pro are perfect! i can set them up at various locations and when i make it to the island every 12-18 months, i can sync up the data. given that the home i will eventually build will be need to be off-grid and energy efficient, the dataset i build up from the stormtags will help me refine things like site position, orientation of home and size of solar panel array i need to maximise the performance. not to mention, how thick my jumpers need to be for the winter chill! :) Whats the advantage of this VS another weather app? Is it just more in depth weather? Hi Jon, the watch connects via bluetooth to the HR monitor and cadence/gear sensor, so is numerical data. Presumably if it connected to the storm tag it would be just doing the same? It is then plugged into the laptop and the data is uploaded for analysis and projected onto a map. Be useful if it was possible to link the Storm Tag to a GPS watch. I use a GPS sports watch for exercise including cycling, that records cadence, altitude, speed, HR etc. Weather data would be useful. It's possible to upload sports data to various sites, perhaps weather data may also be an option Just visited comment pages of finished projects by the same creator, and also the HEX3 facebook page. Now I have doubt about the reliability, efficiency, accuracy etc. about the products. @jon hi! i've just backed this brilliant project and opted for the 5 x stormtag pro. i was also a previous backer of the jaja :) i live in singapore, so for my reward i added an additional $8 for international shipping. is this ok? i have an private island (many timezones away!) that i eventually plan to move to permanently in about 7 years time and these storm tag pros will help me track the weather at various sites across the island to determine the ideal spot to eventually build a cabin :)) @Jon - I have pledged for 5 of the StormTag+. If I wanted to make one of those a Pro, would I simply add the $ difference between a + and a Pro to my pledge? @Joe: Only the + and the pro version do. Check the feature-list for details Something I haven't seen asked is, does the basic Storm Tag collect data even when your phone is not connected? Does it have any memory at all? How much should I add to an early bird level to get a StormTag Pro ? How about a stretch goal to get it delivered on time ? ;) I am so impressed with how Jon has responded to so many comments. I think this product will be great! humidor Hi Jon, How mant chargecycles can the solar chargeable battery in the stormtag pro handle before wearing out? As its moulded inside and cant be replaced, I might consider changing my pledge to the + version. Jake made a good point. I hope, there will be a *native* App using MapKit and not a Web-Wrapper as shown in the demo. Jon? Hi Jon, What is the approx range of the bt le? Can I use ipad instead of iphone? So the iPhone app is a webpage? Does that mean I can also access it from my computer? Also, it would be great for the Stormtag to be wifi enabled, so it could transfer data to your phone when you are not near it. Is it too late (or too pricy) for that? Jon, when using the tag on e.g. a keyring, I expect to easily damage the solar cell. How will the solar cell be protected? Ok Jon. Does the Pro tag have the same size? Any picture or sketch of it? :) And. Is it at all possible to use a normal battery (in the Pro model) if I wanted to? John, What type of rechargeable battery is in the Pro version? Jon. Thanks for your answer. I already have an early bird StormTag but I would like to also get a StormTag+ or a StormTag Pro. How would I go about doing that? So. The Pro model doesn't have a 2032 battery that needs replacement every year, but it has solar power instead?? Or. Someone explain why I should buy/pledge for the Pro model instead of the +model? :) Yeah I agree with Eric de Boer. A linux api or sdk would be great. So. Data logging is what is saved in the internal memory of the tag.. Which means that if I want complete data logging i need to somehow connect my tag to my phone and sync over the data. And with the + model I need to sync it every ten days or more often... And with the Pro model I don't need to sync that often at all... But what is the perk of the solar power of the pro model, I don't get it. Sell it to me please.. :) One the stormtag+ it says 10 days data logging. On the pro model it says 2 years. What does that mean? Do I need to change the battery on the + model every 10 days to get data logging?? Is the time longer on the pro model just because it charges itself by some solar power? Great project ! Just backed on time because only 8 days to go :) Hi Jon, thanks for your great project. As you have got three different stormtag devices since the last update it could be helpful to give us a table with all stormtag alternatives showing all characteristics side by side. E.g. I am still not sure if the stormtag (without + or 'pro') needs a permanent bluetooth connection to my phone for a seamless data tracking. Maybe its just me - but this would be more clear for me and perfect to make the right choice... Again - thanks a lot -- I am looking forward to the device! One last thing - if I want to order more than one stormtag and e.g. two different variants. Do i have to add the single pledges and the shipping and use one single variant where I put the sum in? (I hope you understand what i mean - poor english...) Wich app do i need to instal for the stormtag to see the reading's I am impressed with all the products you come up but whatever reasons you come up with, your lead time and communication should be drastically improved towards people investing in your ideas. ( I am Backer of Stormtag and yufu) @Jon - I'm just wondering with all the new versions of Stormtag and the additions, do you see this setting your production timetable back? If not, can you give us some insight as to how you plan to accomplish adding in all this stuff in the same amount of time? Would be possible smarthings support with the hub? @Daniel, I totally agree, ive backed both projectd as well and am deciding which one to stick with. As the price of the full-featured StormTag gets higher (started at $20 n now $45), I'm leaning closer to the BloomSky although StormTag has a larger user base and is mobile n indoor aswell. Dont really see t sense in getting them both unless they r to be used for entirely different applications, as the differences in measurements between the two would drive me nuts. Would be seriously awesome if you guys would team up with BloomSky (another Weather Kickstarter project) to share data. I've backed both and they seem like a perfect fit to work together. <url>"iftt"?i no know ifttt,in Italy not is famous. This user's account has been deleted. This user's account has been deleted. This user's account has been deleted. Hi! If it possible to measure wind speed by series of data from thermometer (with shield against wind and without and algorithm for differencies in temperature?), or by fluctuactions of pressure? Looks like there is the option for two products. The original, small, low maintenance unit, and a larger more sophisticated device that is wifi/ifttt enabled, probably fixed outside. Yay I love that people agree that IFTTT is a good idea. Please make this happen StormTag! My thought on stretch goals are air quality, some housing for exterior mounting like a radiation shield to prevent false temp readings, solar power and WiFi. Granted those all require a larger footprint in all likelyhood. Does the UV sensing capability include an algorithm to calculate UV Index? I would suggest pollen sensor/detector, if possible The benefits of IFTTT in this instance? Please consider to add (in this order): 1. IFTTT 2. Altimeter 3. Longer data storage I'd back ITFFF support too. A second for IFTT support, from me. Consider Iftt suppport, please. I vote for the addition of wind speed and facility to locate the StormTag Could a solar cell also measure UV? UV index and wind speed would also be very helpful. How do I switch from an early bird backer to a Stormtag+ backer? Also, strech goal suggestion: location tracking to find tag (e.g. On keys) or solar charging. I agree with Max, I like the current small size and long battery life so strecht goals shouldn't impact that. I wonder if solar power is a good idea, as people will put the device int the sun, while temperature should be measured in the shade. I like the smaller upgrades, the weather related light detector and lightning detectors. If it doesn't impact battery life an BLE locator app would be nice. It would also be nice to have a Linux SDK or open protocol. I like the idea of a fully featured device that is low maintenance with a long battery life. Wifi, no question. Even if it drains the batter faster, I'd rather change it more often and hook to wifi. For people who don't feel that way, then couldn't they stick to Bluetooth? I'd like larger storage capacity (>10 days). I'd also vote for wind speed or the lightning detector as well. My stretch goal ideas: Barometer tweaks for measuring altitude as others have already suggested. An anemometer for measuring wind speed. I fly kites and it would be super handy to hold the storm tag up to the wind and read the wind speed off my phone. If you are really keen and can manufacture the parts, when not measuring wind speed you could use the anemometer to charge the battery. An air quality sensor would be sweet as well. Re my previous comment, I meant altimeter not barometer! I could also use a photo sensor in addition to the UV sensor of the + model as part of hours of visible light monitoring. Support for IFTTT would be awesome. An accelerometer would be cool if I mount it to my drone, but not really a weather thing :). Or GPS Air quality sensor As requested, a few ideas for stretch goals. For sure hardware expansion would take precedent over all other features. With an API the hardware could be expanded to multiple use cases. But the hardware needs to be there. - Addition of LED(s). Great for map reading, use around camp, packs, etc. A software switch would give StormTag a sort of security feature (hang it outside the tent area). Also useful for signaling. - Gas sensors, such as CO2 or CO. Useful for judging air quality. Probably cost/size prohibitive. - Use existing BLE, develop locator app (to help find personal items). - Expand battery, add (micro)USB & appropriate electronics, use as a backup for other devices. - Upgrade the housing material. Many backers are requesting an altimeter, but a barometer is an altimeter with the appropriate algorithm (and sensor accuracy). This is a software feature that could be developed by a third party. Measurement altitude would be useful metadata to have on WeatherSignal. Though the phone's GPS can be used. Solar, though cool, is also something I find pretty useless unless the user can use the battery as backup. Alone it would just cut down an already very generous battery life. Changing a $2 battery once a year or two is not a big deal. Thanks. So many people are requesting a barometer, but it already has one. @Greg D - Great point! +1 A majority of the commentators are really pressing for the solar power for the first stretch goal but it really should be the barometer/altimeter sensor first before including a solar power method... after all this is a weather station. It makes more sense to add more weather based stretch goals before focusing on niceties of like solar power. Just my two cents Love the idea of Solar Cell but if you already have thousands of batteries in stock you might not want to go that route! :-) They are 'one year' batteries but if you add other functions that will cut into that estimate I am sure.... GPS would be great! IFTTT support and / or an open API / SDK would really be great. On the sensor site I see a couple of options as stretched goal: - Brightness sensor - Sound sensor - GPS And indeed Solar charging would be awesome. UV meter, lightning detector would be nice. How about lightening detection using a measure of EM pulses. Then you could track severe storms and tell if they were approaching or leaving. For me as a quadcopter flyer wind speed would be a great addition. I prefer the wall mounting kit, provided it (for example on physical agents) is designed meaningful. But this is quite extensive. Otherwise an other software feature... thanks Pollen counter would be nice. Or some sort of dust level counter. I think solar charging and UV meter would be awesome! Will the StormTag be able communicate with a Windows OS or a Linux OS (I use both) that has bluetooth? Reason for asking is that ultimately I'd like to have one StormTag with me that communicates with my phone and one StormTag stationary on my exterior wall that communicates with either my pc or my laptop. Now this wont be a problem for me if I am nearby and my phone can communicate with it every now and then, merely just something that popped up in my mind. And that brings up one last ponder, can you connect two StormTag's to one phone? As for the stretch goal, I'd like to see a pollen counter and GPS positioning of its own, but that surely is impossible for such a small package, not to mention how much it would drain the battery. Instead, I'd rather see longer data retention and maybe solar charging if that is at all possible. Wifi would be cool too, but again, I don't want the battery to be draining out fast. Pollen Counter or Air Quality. Solar charging and colour choices :D The only sensors the Plus model doesn't pack in are an anemometer and rain gauge - good as you are in pretty certain squeezing those in is going to be more than a challenge! Of course in the future if you come up with RainTag and WindTag they can talk to each other... Fantasy hardware aside I think IFTTT integration would be very useful indeed. I'd love ifttt support and at a glance readings on my phone's lock screen. Solar charging would be amazing. Definitely solar, that would be huge! Also, an altimeter would make a great improvement (for instance in mountainous countries). More ideas for the stretch goals: GPS tracking would be great. If it records the exact position of the measure point. UV Sensor. @creator Totally awesomethat you're looking for community input for the stretch goals! 1) Longer data retention (from 10 days to 20 or even 30) 2) air quality measurement 3) wi-fi ability for longer ranges Solarpower sound great. But does it have an li-io rechargeable battery? Wifi would be great - but how long last the battery then? Alarming always wlecome. Longer data storage is also very useful. :-) I like the idea of if/then functions proposed by Beck Peggy, I also like the idea of solar power. Thanks for asking � Would love to see it to be wifi enabled so that it can monitor an interior environment and send an alert remotely when the phone is outside Bluetooth range.. Oh, and please add alerting features like Beck Peggy is suggesting... That, I can see it being practical when outdoors and exposed... ;) phil. Definitely solar if possible, altimeter and, if possible, GPS? I do fear though that adding more wi make it bigger... Am I wrong? Does GPS makes sense to you folks or am I in the left field? Thanks for your opinion on that. phil. I would love to see 30 days of low level data stored instead of 10. Measurement of air quality would be great! If not solar or alerts Solar would be cool. Solar would be great. Maybe have EnOcean or Zigbee connectivity. I also love the idea of solar power. $100k- audible alerts when pressure drops to understand the potential for storms. Would love the app to be able to make if and then functions. I.e if >30 degrees then alert "it is above 30 degrees - turn the fan on/check the dogs water/etc". This could be used for any of the sensors. Another example - if pressure < 20 then alert "it is about to rain" etc. Look at the app ifttt for the concept. I would love solar. A wall tag would be nice, but we can find something at a home store. Red color sensor would be nice, too is some sort of air quality sensor possible? this would certainly be a unique feature! As to update 4: a wall hanger that could be used outside or inside would be nice Jon: Having reviewed your prior history here, it appears you have chosen Kickstarter as your initial funding source of preference. Nothing inherently wrong with that, but it does present a philosophical question for me. At what point do you see Jon Atherton being able to stand on his own? You have cross-marketed projects; you have multiple projects funded and in development at the same time, and you are acting for all the world like a corporation. Why does Jon Atherton, Inc. need to get free money any longer after raising about $500,000 on Kickstarter (and Indegogo)? Back in September 2012 on your first project you said: "[D]uring the last 6 months my team and I have completed the following tasks: 1. built an in house, world class design team, 2. a business unit in USA, 3. A PR and marketing team, 4. a software team for the SDK/API, 5. a separate software team for games for AppTag [project 2] 6. consulted with press and had interviews around the world (this was critical to garner support of software developers - so you have some apps to use!) 7. coordinated with the above to construct a sales website and SDK/API portal 8. Sourced vendors for materials, electronics, engineering and built a relationship with a factory in China, for mass production - so you get your Kickstarter reward. 9. visited Chinese factory and Hong Kong 3 times for a total of 4 weeks (collectively members of our team have been in China for 12 man-weeks with another trip scheduled next week, 10. been at home with my wife and family for 6 days from the last 2 months 11. put over $600,000 of my own money into the two kickstarter projects for payment for long lead time parts, tooling and to do all of 1-8 12. had a 2 steps forward one step back existence for every waking hour, 13. worked at least 18 hour days 7 days a week, 14 had an average email load of ~240 emails per day for the last 3 months. I applaud your efforts, but question the need to fund a corporation that appears to have developed an obvious income stream. What are your thoughts? Thank you for your response, but i have to say that i do not get any answer from your support since month. I will write you now in private on this project. Please answer me directly. Thank you Hello Jon, maybe i will get an answer here.... I backed two of your Projects, but i do get no answer at any way... no Email, no Kickstarter Message, no Information in comments (interessing because here you are very active)... Please get back to all your backers that already payed!!! I mean i paied a lot of money in your projects, but now after i paied, you let us in the dark?? PLEASE Answer Paul Riddell: Everything about the iFind was a lie. Forget it. This project has all the trappings of being technologically feasible and within the bounds of known physics. A battery is a minor inconvenience necessitating maybe an annual change at most as compared to finding, seizing, storing and using magic beams of stray energy. Plus with a battery we won't have to hold the Storm Tag next to a microwave horn to make it work. I like the idea, and the plan. The hard part will be the software, not so much the hardware (not to say the hardware is not difficult, just that they are not having to rewrite quantum string theory like the iTag Bozos). Plugging yet again for the windows phone app, not even as a stretch goal,I mean you're like 400% over do it!!!!! I've been studying this for a while, but i'm wondering how temperature is being affected by the color of the StormTag. For instance: a black one gets hotter when its in the sun then the white one. How is this measured / corrected? I am in agreement with shilohtd, I would love to see a Windows Phone app. If not at launch, at least at some point in the future would be awesome. Congratulations on smashing through your goal, and so quickly too. Here's to 27 more days of none-stop new backers. Motor sports participant change the carburetor jet size at the track dependent on pressure, temperature (and humidity). Check out <url>"0% chance of rain". Hopefully this will be more reliable. Hi, I will use stormtag+ to monitor the outside of my house, like a weather station, this is why I asked to add more features to the android app. This user's account has been deleted. I'll hang it somewhere in my backyard. If it works well, I'll probably get another to take with me. Have been looking at those weather stations at Walmart. Hoping this is a nice alternative... Hi Jon, Would it be possible to fit stormtag with a kinetic battery like the iFind tag project on kickstarter? I recived a mail for discount for your product,s So i try to buy one more but it did not work What to do now Do you know how long it takes for the measurement to stabilize to the tolerance range when it goes from one environment to another (say a change of +/- 10C)? I had a similar device previously and it takes 5 minutes or more, which is quite frustrating. Hope the StormTag can be more sensitive to measurement changes.. Also I just doubled my pledge Please tell me you're going to do windows phone. I am a climate science guy and would love to be able to use it. Will we be notify when the battery power is low? How hard will it be to change the battery? @TonysWang it is so so difficult not to write back a depraved comment based upon your question and profile name....but I resisted! :-) I just backed the project. If I keep the tag in my pants pocket, will it be detecting the humidity and temperature from my body instead of the ambient temp? @Jon, thanks for the info. If I want a stormtag+ additionally to the earlybird stormtag I already pledged for, do I just add the missing amount? What about the shipping Outsider US? Thanks for the Great project! Hi Jon What happens when the temperature gets out of spec? Here in Switzerland we have sometimes temperatures below -10 C ;) I wonder whether the application (Weather Signal) will be complemented by a precise date and time data acquisition. Existing allows export to CSV but on a cellular phone would be interesting to see more detailed information, not just the graph without the detailed data. Do you intend to connect to some more application or even create your own? Congratulations on a great idea! Thanks ! This is my first kickstarter project I follow... It looks on track! I can not wait to have it in hand! I look forward ! what accuracy are you expecting from StormTag, for example are you talking of whole numbers for temp etc, and tollerance. Would it be possible to recover my keyring when a stormtag+ wil be attached to it @Creator I'm curious. Have you determined how many sensors will be required to support a decent network? As of 1002 backers I have seen only 1262 sensors bought. Looking at something like Wunderground with 30000+, will StormTag provide any useful crowd based synergies? Would also love a Developer API so that Developers could access the data and build Apps on top of it. I second shilohtd. A Windows Phone App would be great! Hope this works ok on Android S3. My Shaka weather station is very hit and miss due to Packet data loss. Will you please make a windows phone app? Thanks! (if im asking questions that are on a webpage somewhere can you just point me to that?) Does the device send any kind of alert to the user to change it? Hi - I may have missed it but, how long are the CR2032 batteries expected to last? Hi, I backed your StormTag project today, looks very promising. Would it be possible using the Stormtag with a domotica program, such as Homeseer or in combination with an more open device like the Rasberry pi? That would be an interesting addition to the product. Any experiences anyone? Is it somehow open source, or will there be a possibility reading or receiving the data directly into an pc or so? Than the Stormtag would also be useful as an additional sensor for domotica purposes as well? Hi @Creator, is there any difference between your product and this (<url>
