We can't thank you enough for the support and the vote of confidence you've given us in telling such an important story about racism in America. Over 1,000 backers - unbelievable! We've hit our goal! The film will be made. We're beaming. But we're not finished yet. We still have until Wednesday at 2pm ET to fundraise. More money means more time to edit the film past the rough cut stage and into completion. We can spend more time with a composer to get the score just right, and we can finally afford to license all the archival footage we'll need to tell the story. More money will help pay for the soundmix and the coloring we'll need if we're accepted into a top-tier festival. This is why we've set our NEW GOAL to $75,000. With your help we can get there and make this the best film it can be. Thanks for all your support. WELCOME TO LEITH is a feature film offering a glimpse into a town struggling for sovereignty against one man's extremist vision. Filmed during an 8 month period documenting a white separatist's arrest for terrorizing the townspeople on an armed patrol and his subsequent release from jail six months later, WELCOME TO LEITH is an eerie document of American DIY ideals played out in one of the most under populated states in the nation. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ We released a teaser for this project back in February and it was viewed 21,675 times on the second day. Now, four months later, the teaser's been viewed over 248,000 times and has gotten a fair amount of press: The Daily Kos Dazed Reddit AMA with Co-Director Michael Beach Nichols Gawker Huffington Post Live Filmdrunk Politix Business Insider Talking Points Memo Slash Film You, our amazing Kickstarter backers, allowed us to complete our previous feature documentary, FLEX IS KINGS, and we couldn't be more grateful. You put your trust in a group of first-time filmmakers and allowed us to make a film that we put our hearts and souls into. Because of you, that film is playing in theaters NOW, and will be released digitally in July on Itunes, Vimeo, Netflix, and VOD. Our backers will be receiving DVDs and digital downloads in a matter of days. We owe everything to crowd fundraising. Now we need your help again. WELCOME TO LEITH is a fascinating and frequently suspenseful story about race, civil liberties, and freedom in America. That it takes place in the shadow of the biggest oil boom in North Dakota's history makes the film a complex document exploring unforeseen causes and effects. HOW KICKSTARTER WORKS: On the right, you’ll see the pledge levels with corresponding rewards. If we do not reach our goal, we will not receive any of the funds, and the film will not be completed. This is all or nothing. HOW WE'LL SPEND THIS MONEY: Finishing principle production (complete remaining interviews/vérité). Editing the film into a strong fine cut ready to be submitted to festivals in the fall. This is the biggest and most expensive chunk. Hiring composers to create an amazing score.

From Amazon: "Growing up in South Dakota, Josh Garrett-Davis knew he would leave. But as a young adult, he kept going back -- in dreams and reality and by way of books. With this beautifully written narrative about a seemingly empty but actually rich and complex place, he has reclaimed his childhood, his unusual family -- and the Great Plains." Here's a trailer for the book starring Josh and South Dakota. Shot and cut by Michael. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Receive a digital download of our recently completed, Kickstarter-funded film FLEX IS KINGS! The film opened the Viewpoints section of the 2013 Tribeca film festival, a category reserved for "a panorama of the freshest voices in independent film and contemporary documentary from around the world." The Village Voice calls it "an eye-popper," Screen Picks called it "a masterful piece of filmmaking...about the community as a whole," and PBS/POV says "Flex is Kings gets it, and it effectively demonstrates that it is an art form, a cultural mode of expression that is as beautiful and honorable as any other." Check it out on Itunes here: Flex is Kings on Itunes _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Legendary New York City Photographer Clayton Patterson has generously donated 10 LIMITED EDITION, SIGNED & NUMBERED 16x20 prints to the campaign - we can't even express how excited we are for this. Especially since he's leaving NYC soon for Europe. "Since 1979 Clayton Patterson has dedicated his life to documenting the final era of raw creativity and lawlessness in New York City's Lower East Side, a neighborhood famed for art, music and revolutionary minds." This print is going to be weird and amazing. Check out some of his work below, as well as on his blog. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Special thanks to the amazing musicians who provided music for our trailer: Khari Mateen Phil Quinaz Hellmichwood + THANK YOU If you like the film project, we would be incredibly grateful for your support. If you can't pledge, please share the page with anyone you can. Thank you for reading and I hope you will join the effort to help make this powerful and important film. Mike + Chris Hi! We just wanted to share a short video Sundance put together featuring us speaking about the filmmaking process that went into Welcome to Leith . <url>"Leith’s recent stranger than fiction history speaks to American ideals of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness – most provocatively, on both sides of the conflict. The town’s relative desolation and Midwestern setting paradoxically suggests both a sense of inconsequence and import – while Cobb’s plan may have only had an impact on a small number of people, it might have been the testing ground for expansion to other small towns and beyond." As well, Tribeca Film chose the project as their fundraising pick last week: "While it would be an easy story to sensationalize, Nichols and Walker capture both sides of the Leith conflict with objectivity and respect." Finally - Chris and I will be on HuffPost Live at 2pm ET today! We'll be joined by Leith Mayor Ryan Schock calling in, and white separatist Craig Cobb via Skype. You can check that out here: <url>"Welcome to Leith": <url>"vitally important" by Christopher Stipp of Slash Film, who went on to write "the pitch/trailer does not mess around, does not speak in platitudes, but lets the content of what will be examined speak for itself. It’s wonderfully presented, really well shot, and could not be more deserving of a couple minutes of your time," while Mary Noble of Politix describes the trailer as "haunting." The catch is that the filmmakers behind WELCOME TO LEITH need some money to get their film off the ground. I recently donated______ and I encourage you to do what you can to help. They are using a website called Kickstarter to raise $60,000 by July 2nd. Every little bit counts, so please take a look at their campaign and consider donating: <url>’s a great way to be involved in documenting an important story. Thanks for taking the time to read this and let me know if you have any questions. Your Friend, _____________ Hey Welcome to Leith team, Just a couple of quick updates: Michael did a Reddit AMA today - if you'd like to see some of his answers to making-of-the-documentary questions, you may do so here . And some truly exciting news - the film was chosen as Reddit's first-ever Kickstarter of the Month - this is wonderful for us, and will help get the film in front of so many new eyes! As part of that, we'll be checking in here to answer questions ALL. MONTH. LONG. Hit us up. As well, Michael did an NPR interview on the film. Take a listen to his nervous voice over at Prairie Public Radio if you dare! Thanks again for all your support. Mike and Chris We can't thank everyone enough for contributing to our campaign and helping us spread it around. You're helping us tell a story that we feel will resonate for many, many years. We still have a long way to go, but after today, we feel incredibly optimistic about reaching our goal. Some cool news - Co-Director Michael Beach Nichols will be doing an AMA ("Ask Me Anything") on Reddit THIS Wednesday, June 4th at 1pm EST/10am PST ( reddit.com/r/iama ). Come check it out and hear more about what went into making this documentary. The trailer went up on Reddit earlier today, and this was definitely my favorite post: Again - we couldn't do this without you. Let's keep it moving. And please feel free to contact me or Chris if you have any questions at all. Thanks, Mike and Chris More DVDs are shipping out tomorrow - it's taken us longer than expected to get everything packaged and addressed. Sorry for the delays - domestic backers should receive their rewards next week, and international backers the week after that! Hey JR, Thanks for your comment. Not to get technical, but we actually addressed the backers on June 11th, which was 1 1/2 months ago. We will have some exciting news very soon - our NYC theatrical release is in the works! This is what we've been waiting for, and have finally achieved with your support. Unfortunately, we still don't have any updates on when awards will start going out. This is largely dependent upon the theatrical release, which takes place before DVDs are manufactured. If we had to guess, it's likely they won't go out until late winter. But that could be wrong, too. We apologize for not getting the ship date correct, but that's part of the process. Filmmaking is a very slow beast, but we are doing our best and will update everyone when we have something to share. We really appreciate all your support, and hope that you can bear with us a little longer. Thanks, Mike & Chris Hey Timothy, We most definitely haven't forgotten our supporters. However, there is a big difference between a festival version of a film and a final version of a film. We are still making small changes in the edit room that are influenced by our experience watching the film with audiences. We are planning a big update soon and will hopefully have some news to share about distribution. Sorry, Craig. We're still finishing up the film, so nothing has been sent out. We apologize for the delay, and will keep everyone posted. We're in the editing room right now and expect to be finished editing by the first week of December - after that, it's time to soundmix and color! We're currently submitting the film to festivals, and will be sure to update everyone on where/when the film will premiere! Thanks again for all your support. Thank you so much Suzanne! We're so grateful for your support. Congratulations on your nomination for an Emmy Award for Best Documentary! I'm proud to be your supporter! Just tried my download link and got an 401 error, received link back in December of 2015 but the email was push off by junk mails, and finally located it. Please advise. Hello guys! We are back for a new Kickstarter! A Sci-Fi this time! And I am checking all the old projects we had back... And I would love to watch your documentary! It's any way that I can pay and watch it? Did you guys distributed anywhere? VOD? Everything will work :) we just want to watch it :) please let us know... I got an Error 401 from the link. Have not been able to see this yet. Have all the DVD's been sent? Haven't received one yet. Thanks. I too am have had trouble downloading the film along with the music score. I know that I tried to do this after the movie became available due to a vacation I was on. But now that I am back, is there a way to re-open the link for me? I've tried several times to download the film and each time it dies partway through with a network error. Tonight when I went to the link to try again, the site told me I "don't belong here." This is very frustrating - I really would like my copy of the down loaded film. Thanks. Downloaded and watched the film over the weekend. Very well done! Hi, I've tried to download the film 3 times now from the link you provided and each time it's failing at about 75% through, reporting an 'unknown network error'... Is the site particularly overloaded or is there something else going on? Is anyone else having the same problem? Great Job! From a project creator to another project creator... Thanks to be here and make it happen! :) you rock!!!!! Woah, I was looking up movies to watch tonight and noticed that this film is playing in NYC!!! So Excited to see it! Any update on a delivery date for this film? Happy you're screening the film, but I'd like to sceen my own copy as well. It's been 4 months since you last addressed the backers. thank you JR Some other film projects on kickstarter make their films available to backers via digital download. Is that an option for you guys? Looking forward to the downloadable version! Some people might be anxious because they're worried they might never get it, but since you're showing it at festivals, I'd be surprised if we didn't get what we contributed money for. Take your time, do it right, and thanks for all your hard work! Dudes! Port Townsend Film Festival! In September. I don't know if they are still selecting films, can't hurt to try. (And we are known for taking care of "our" filmmakers -- it is a pretty great experience for you, too.) It would be nice to remember your supporters. Seems to me you have forgotten us now you are on the film festival trail. Can't belieive yoir remarks thT you are finishing up a movie while visiting various film festivals. Very dissappointed. This is respectful and considerate! It would have been nice to receive the reward I was promised when I pledged. Congratulations on a terrific debut at Sundance!! Looking forward to everything that's ahead for you and Welcome to Leith. Awesome recognition for a great film made by a couple of stand up dudes...congrats!! Any news on when the film will be completed? Congratulations! Very excited to see the finished product! It takes a community.... Congratulations guys! Now go get'um! Congratulations! And thank you for making this important film. Congratulations guys! I pledged 25 dollars. I was there the day of the demonstration and have been supportive of the people of Leith in my home state. I really like the style you are using in this film (maintaining a neutral stance and letting the audience decide. very good! makes me feel conflicted!) The music is fantastic and creates a sense of urgency and suspense! I have a feeling that your documentary will be the buzz among the film festival circuits! I hope you both decide to submit this to the Dakota Digital Film Festival in Bismarck next year =) -Jessy Those 7 minutes look astounding. Congratulations. Great news. Fantastic news! This project really deserved it. I just received your email that you hit your goal! What great news! I'm so glad you met your goal (so much so that I increased my pledge), and happy to be able to help. Congrats! I'm so glad you met your goal! This is very much a story that needs to be told. The worst thing for bigotry and hatred is public exposure. I know your efforts will make a terrific contribution to a better world! I'm very pleased that you got this bump at near the end. I'd like to think my share of it helped. We've all got to do everything we can to roll back this dark fog of bigotry and racism, for there is only one place it leads, if left unchecked. Congratulations! Hooray! Glad to see such a healthy last-minute push for this project! Chris, this story exposes racism and the despicable hatred and ignorance that feeds into it. We are extremely proud of both of you and Mike Backed and helping to spread the word Just contributed and shared. I grew up in Idaho when the Aryan Nations "Church" was doing the same kind of shit not far from family property. It's so important for people to understand that this kind of ignorance and hate still exists, and still needs to be countered by brave action. Thanks for bringing the sunlight. I increased my pledge. I really want to see this project succeed!
