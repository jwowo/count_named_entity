Hi guys. Basically I'm just repeating what I get told and the frustration on this end is just as high as we would really like to not have to deal with this awkward situation and focus on the actual fabrication. Needless to say, @Chris, I can only be but optimistic. Mid next week is the most accurate time quote I currently have and I'll (keep) asking and calling and mailing till its complete. This may not be the answer you'd like or the answer I'd prefer giving, but this is what we have and I'm again, optimistic about this concluding to the satisfaction of everyone involved. Appreciate your patience. @Sam sure hope so, I think any date would be a great date but H.B in advance :) Hey guys, Really sorry about not answering comments a little more quickly I was a little under the weather. I've had a confirmation that everything should be processed by mid next week and that the holdup was due to the sudden transfer of almost all funds. I'll try to get with all emails sent yesterday and today as quickly as possible. Appreciate your patience everyone while things run their course and I hope everyone has a wonderful week. Thanks Chris, thanks Jeff. Means a lot to me. I'll continue to do my very best to keep you guys up to date and remain steadfast with respect to getting everyone situated. As soon as the refunding process is over, I greatly look forward to working with everyone on the product as I still believe very strongly in the product and am willing to put as much effort into as possible. You guys all came together under this project to support the product and I feel I owe it to each and every backer to make sure it sees completion. Thanks again, made my day! :) Hi Chris, We made our transfers first of this month based on the numbers of backers that have responded through Sept. With respect to the remainder, I try to keep everything non confrontational but do note that it would have been really simple for me to just say I'm going to continue with manufacturing and we'll update you as things evolve. This project was started at a time when the Kickstarter TOS was a little less clear and timelines were loose guides and not stipulated upon. So with respect to litigation, thats not really an issue. A lot of backers actually were refunded, I think at one time you guys could simply have logged into Amazon and requested funds back and a lot did actually. As for stringing you guys along, to be honest theres no need and it's not my intention. Things were messy, I took over and thankfully made some key decisions to clear this project up and move things along. It's frustrating for you and even more for myself but when I said everything looks great I really meant it. What backers that haven't been refunded will be, I have an older model, a newer model, and an entirely new model in the works, and I still get weekly emails from interested parties looking to purchase units when they are available. From what I gather, the older team didn't bother responding to anyone, not on comments, not messages and certainly not emails. Thats a night and day difference right there. I've also publicly taken ownership of the company which I didn't have to whatsoever. I could simply have sued for breach of contract on work rendered and went on my way. I'm sorry you guys have to wait and it's a disheartening but on the bright side, I actually do look forward to having non refunded backers taken care of and I'm expecting this to be soon. We did our part, you guys did your part, and it should be a smooth transition. You or any backer wishing detailed info not publicly provided are more than welcome to reach out to by email and we can definitely work something out to everyones satisfaction. Till that time, I'm going to wait along with you guys and make sure everything is taken care of as you deserve nothing less. I really hope that helps Chris. Theres only a few backers really that are vocal on here and though I appreciate your concerns, the best I can do right now is continue updating, follow through with requests, and make sure what refunds haven't been issued are issued so we can all move along to hopefully better and brighter things. I took over a messy company, it was disorganized and chaotic and not equipped to handle the project. This project stagnated for almost an entire year however, again, everything looks great (now) and I look forward to beginning the next phase of this project as soon as funds are posted individually to everyone. Sorry, wanted to clarify. Wire transfers from BofA domestically are processed usually in 1-2 business days unless pending to be cleared. The reasons are multiple and many. PayPal sites 1-21 business days while Amazon sites 2-14. I'll check on this daily and make sure everyone is kept up to date on anything that develops in the meantime. As of right now, everything looks great and I expect this to complete itself relatively soon. Hope that helps! Hey guys, I've been off and on with the BofA and the only thing I get is that we are still within acceptable timeframes with respect to wire transfers. I don't pretend to know why but I was told 2-14 business days would be within the realms of normal and we're on the latter end of that spectrum. To answer Moritz, I'm not really sure which part of the world you are from memory but here in Michigan company ownerships are public information. The only investor really is myself and I took over the company and this project thinking it's still a cool idea, people still want it, and it can be done feasibly. Since the boards are already available, the basic model can be produced by CNC milling parts. I don't think I need to release a lot at a time but they can be done in batches of 50-100 and made available . Regardless of a product delay or not, the product itself is tangible, has obvious support from a lot of people and would be successful in specific quantities. It's unfortunate there were delays but it happens more frequently than not. @everyone else that commented below (sorry, they seem to mirror the same subject), refunds were/are/will be processed and the information we requested was sufficient to make sure it gets to the right place. I'm going to go ahead and let this ride out as our sole intention is to move forward from this phase and then work on the unit. If it takes a few extra days than anticipated I apologize however, it's something that needs to be done regardless. I hope you guys can understand I'd love nothing more than for this to be over and I will follow through with it until everyone is situated and taken care of. Project comment emails are still a bit iffy, I get them in batches and usually a few hours after they were sent so if anyone needs to contact us and get an immediate response email is still the fastest route though we will continue checking on this section as frequently as possible. Thanks for posting guys! I know its frustrating given how long this project has been going on but I'm doing everything I can to move it along as quickly as possible. Have a great day/night. @Chris B. np. @Chris Thomas, understandable however nothing we do or say now is going to expedite anything and we look forward to all requests being handled respectively. @Merlin, appreciate your patience and understandably your pledge was rather significant. WU transfers (and we basically only have 8 requests) were handled the same way as other methods. We use BofA and all money transfers are done via wires. We don't handle cash nor are we equipped to do so. It's unfortunately everyone had to wait literally almost 3 years for funds to be returned and we really do appreciate everyones patience on the last stretch. I'll go ahead and send you an email as well. Thanks all for posting. @Chris Bearcroft, @Nathan, sent emails few minutes ago. @Sam, WB. Lots of new info on the update section. @Chris Thomas, @Moritz, guys seriously you need to ride this out with the rest of us. I've checked with BofA, Amazon and PayPal and we're still within the suggested wait times. New accounts, amounts well over 10k. Hopefully this will only be a matter of literally a few days. @Backers, We're not getting email notifications for comments, if you need something brought to our attention quickly, email <email>. Thanks! Have a great Weekend all! You are very much welcome Jeremy. Really appreciate your patience guys while everything is being handled - very excited for everything to go through and get started on the fun stuff! Anytime Zach, would have responded earlier but we didn't get a typical email notification, I was randomly on Kickstarter and noticed it! Small note: For some reason we're getting Kickstarter notifications when backers comment a little later than usual (used to be almost instant). If we we don't get back to a message or comment immediately, pardon in advance! Hey guys, Just got off with both Amazon and PayPal and we've been informed that we should get individually posted refunds in the next couple days. As soon as we start getting individual invoices (emails?) will go ahead and mass mail everyone. @Zach, Jeremy, will go ahead and drop you guys emails in a few minutes. Thanks! Hi William, we sent an update explaining the situation. Your refund along with any refund requested during Sept has been processed. We expect that once payments are cleared and posted to individual accounts you guys should be all set. Will keep everyone posted with any developments. Thanks! Hi guys, emailed you both. @Mike, I think i'm going to throw a really large party when this is all finished :) @Kunaal, sent you an email if you'd like more info Hi Kunaal. That request has been processed and you should look forward to it relatively soon. Thanks for checking in. Hi Preston. Usually speaking (and this is from normal experience), you'd make purchases on Amazon or PayPal by adding credit to your account or linking your account to a credit card. There are limits on how that works as well as limits to how many people you can send funds to and how much. For this, we just simply contacted them and let them know what was going on. We just simply supply them with a list and do a wire transfer. It works for us and we don't run into any unforeseen issues. It shouldn't take that long really and we expect this is the best situation possible. Will keep you and everyone posted. You'll be taken care of with everyone else Moritz, you should get an email in good time. Always a pleasure to hear from you ;) Not a problem. We should have had a system in place for notifying everyone. We will however, notify everyone individually when we get a confirmation that funds were deposited. Let me know if I can help with anything else in the meantime. Hi Joonathan, we haven't mass mailed anyone but I did respond back to your email on Sept 25th, you might want to check your email junk settings and allow our email address. In any case, your mail was received on the 3rd and processed along with the emails received during Sept. Hope that helps! Hi Andy. I was referring to individual receipts for individual transactions. We as well as backers will get email confirmations when a payment is posted and should be a relatively pain-free way to track. Will keep you guys updated as things develop. Haven't gotten any receipts on this end Chris... @Peter, representatives = we called Amazon, PayPal. We literally have till now less than a handful of requests for WU or check. Pardon, didn't mean to sound mysterious. Quotations for standard time-frames can be found on their websites though we expect that it won't take much time at all (very thankfully) @Chris, not mentioning refunds at all would be counter-intuitive to our goals at this point :) We're happy to offer the refunds as a way to bring closure to the project on Kickstarter so that we may continue at our own pace and bring those backers interested in the product some meaningful progress. Thankfully, hope in us will not be required when you're finally able to withdraw your funds though we'll do our best to restore your confidence by offering a well-made product at an excellent price. Hope that helps! Hey guys. Sorry I can't get to comments as quickly as I'd like. @Derik, It's unfortunate yes I am very glad to have come this far to be quite honest. I look forward to my own refund as silly as that might sound. No one currently affiliated with this project has slept a restful wink in quite some time and this project lays heavily on the conscious. With that said, (and kindly pardon the brevity as you your comments are typically more prolific), I really can't wait for everyone to be taken care of and look forward to it above all. This has been a very humbling experience to say the very least. I'll always do my best to get back with anyone that reaches out, this of course is my pleasure and responsibility. @Preston, we did not dare tackle the refunding by ourselves and are in contact with appropriate representatives. We were asked to provide a list of names/emails and the amounts to be refunded. This we have collected and passed along. We will do the same thing at the end of every month till the New Year. At this time, we consider a refund request processed as it is out of our hands. We are requested to to wire funds to cover the current list whereby the account managers will handle the account postings en gross. (This is a good thing). lol. We will followup with this on a daily basis. We will also answer messages, comments, and emails as quickly as possible. Additional reminders will be sent with frequency. Backers that have questions are more than welcome to post them however they deem appropriate and we'll do our best to give honest, direct answers. I hope that was helpful! Sorry Preston. We did what we intended and there are no excuses required. We collected what info we needed, figured out what funds to send and where, and went ahead with the whole thing. If it takes a little time to post a payment to individual accounts we have no control over it and have done our part and will continue to do the same part till every refund has been processed. It's getting a little frustrating to say the least and I'm glad to be done with it. We have issued some refunds already but the bulk list was sent a little earlier. I think it would be best for everyone to go ahead with the process, collect their refunds, and walk away good intentions and a lot of experience. I appreciate your concerns but for the time being I'll just wait for the process to ride its course. Ah that explains it! :) Do let us know when everything is set or if we can help you with anything in the meantime. BR Hi Travis, That would most likely be impossible as we posted payments a short while ago. As for the supposedly, it was sent via Kickstarter not by us :) You might want to double check your email allow list settings and make an exception for @kickstarter.com. We don't expect any backers to see a posted payment for a few days. Hope that helps. Hello again. Just sent out an update for anyone that has previously sent in their details (sept 2 till today). I'm afraid we won't be able to add anyone to this list as it has already gone out for the previous month. For anyone who is just joining us welcome! Kindly check out the updates section for Update 41 for details. Thanks all! Hey guys. We are indeed going to be taking care of this issue today and will send an update as promised yesterday. Hold on and stay tuned! Thanks again Peter. Everything is set in place to ensure that everyone is going to be taken care of. Payments will be issued to Amazon, Paypal etc. and hopefully things will be handled appropriately. This next upcoming week should be a fruitful one and perhaps after this transition we can go ahead with the actual project. Will keep everyone updated with developments. Have a great one :) Hi Peter. Thanks for writing in. I'm going to go ahead and summarize based on what I understand the series of questions to be: will a refund be processed within 21 days of receipt. The short answer: yes. The remainder of the logic is sound however, some backers might see a processed refund time shorter than others. We planned to take refund requests till the end of September and then process it Oct. 1st. That was the logic behind it. This would give us an understanding of where funds needed to be sent. That's what we plan on doing at least. We have a few more days and then we will go ahead and process the refunds we currently have. (Sorry if I'm not understanding the question?). @Chris, Peter, I've checked and the project page will not be altered and backers should still be able to comment unless removed from Amazon in specific situations. I will be keeping this page active for the purposes of interacting with former backers and will not request it be closed down after the refund process. With respect to the 21 day timeframe, to give you guys some perspective, I have less than 30 requests for Feb 2 - 12th. Ill be sending out another update Monday. A few corporate level sponsors have been refunded as well as some larger orders however individual level backers here have yet to be issued any refunds however will be processed accordingly. Hope that helps. Thank you as always Moritz. To clarify, we have your full name, your contact details and even then it's more than I'm personally interested in to be frank. I'v taken over the responsibilities of this project to refund the backers (by the way, I backed this project myself) and make the product I was promised would be made. There have been a lot of failed companies or ideas over the Kickstarter years. I wouldn't be so quick to judge it's not as easy as it looks really. I'm very glad that I'll be able to offer you a refund and appreciate your patience and the patience of everyone else involved while this is wrapped up. Hello backers, Just wanted to inform everyone that I will be out of town tomorrow and may not get back to emails or messages until Weds. Pardon in advance. @Steve, any backer could have done the same with any major CC. Going through the records, apparently you guys were even recommended to do that by former management. @Peter, been back and forth and we will not be seeing any diminishing backer numbers. When everyone is refunded we may have the ability to request the page in its entirety be removed however, we feel no need at this time. There have been refunds in specific tiers and obviously the rest will follow accordingly. Hope that helps. Hi Peter. I'm going to go ahead and comment on that in a few hours after I gather a little info. Sorry I missed the comment earlier. @WEEKA, thanks for posting. All refunds are (respectfully) on the way. We have received your email and it will be processed in the allotted timeframe. More information is available on the initial update. Hope that helps! @Tatsu, some backers that respond later than others will experience requests processed much sooner (with respect to the number of days) than others. This is unfortunately just due to the logistics of the whole thing. We're going to go ahead and keep the phrase as it is as it reflects a more accurate expectation. Thanks for sharing though :) @Karl, Tatsu, as stated in the previous update, emails have been received (yours as well). As for the 21 business days, again, kindly allow up to 21 business days for your refund to be processed from when your request is sent. We're writing a small script to send email confirmations to everyone that sent one. We will also be sending out another reminder tomorrow evening. Hi Seth, thanks for your question. We have allotted 21 business days for a refund to be processed and this was stated in the refund update. Simply the reason being is due to the various ways in which backers can received a refund. We have given ample time to figure out how funds need to be allocated to a service in question (like Amazon or Paypal). By giving backers choices we also needed to include a scheduled deposit timeframe so that we don't accidentally over-deposit into say Amazon when for example we needed to allocate funds to Paypal. It's inconvenient unfortunately to everyone to have to wait however, we're trying to make sure everyone is taken care of in a reasonable timeframe and not run into any issues that could potentially lead to delays. Hope that answers your question! Hey guys, Just so everyone is a little more comfortable, we will be sending out another update tomorrow as we're getting really low turnout so far. We'll keep doing this for as long as we can. Additionally, we will be setting up some sort of system so that we can send a confirmation to every single backer that has mailed us thus far as this is obviously an issue we should have addressed from the beginning. Thanks for bearing with us guys, really appreciate it especially given this final phase with respect to getting everyone situated. @Tan Thanks for the suggestion however as stated in the update emails sent are always received unless for whatever reason it wasn't and in those cases your mail delivery system will let you know. As we are running from a Microsoft account, the only auto-reply we can give is global and won't work in this case. We do however respond to each email that specifically requests a confirmation receipt. Hope that helps. Thanks Feras, yes your email was received. @Angustimus, message received via Kickstarter messaging :) @mghobrial, confirmed thank you! @Derik, @Kicjobjob, our Facebook page is still available, we might just go ahead and start using that as a way to update everyone in the future. I haven't actually opened it since purchasing the entity but I'll go ahead and see how we can update it. Google+ sounds like a nice idea especially with the Hangouts option. I'll def check it out! Thanks for the indirect suggestion :) @Derick, let me look into that today and I'll have a more solid answer for you. @Andy, email in general either goes through or doesn't. Assuming you don't get a postmaster failure error (which from my experience, Microsoft is pretty good about their mail), we have received your email. @Sonia, thanks for that! Good to know. Hi Kevin, Missing how you'd like it processed - email replied to. Thanks for writing. Yep, confirmed. (No need for confirmations really, emails either go through or they don't!) :) HI Michael, Confirmed (though when sending you an email, we get a server error!) Guillaume** (sorry!) Hi Merlin, Confirmed :) Hey guys, There will be another update mirroring the previous update later tomorrow. No need to send in info if you already have. Will try to update the FAQ with some basic answers to the most asked questions. Have a great one! It's possible Chris since a lot of backers were refunded in an unorthodox manner. CC refunds, PayPal, etc. We sent an email checking up on how all that works. Will revert back when we have a better understanding. @Derik I'll have to check up on that as I'm not too sure of the details on how that works. We do have emails now though so I guess we could always set up a mailing list of some sort. On that note, with times being what they are and so much going on online, a healthy dose of cynicism and transparency is always a good thing :) Hi Ross. A confirmation was actually sent to you on the 2nd (might want to check your junk mail). In general though, we're not actually responding to every email though we try to when there were comments besides the provided information (yours happened to have some particularly nice words!) - Hope that helps. The refunding of a project is a collaborative effort especially when dealing with some of the earlier projects as the terms of agreement were not yet changed. It's in the best interests of everyone involved that these things are handled effectively. Technically, we are paying the commission differences from our own pockets both to KS and Amazon. When we purchased the company we had several talks with various parties on how we could gain access to various lists and how we might go about giving a refund if we decided not to continue with the project as it stands. I guess it makes sense that after refunds are issued former backers will no longer be able to comment as commenting is backer-only. Hope that helps. lol Chris. I think the only incentive we need is not having to wake up in the morning and have some unsatisfied customers :) Not sure backers that have been refunded will be allowed to comment any-longer though. Just FYI. @Derik, Makes sense and we appreciate you looking out for your fellow backers' interests. 21 business days from when a backer sends us an email is the allotted timeframe. We have in several cases responded to some backers for additional information; these are few and involved cases where the backer did not specify what type of refund they wanted. We will in fact honor refund requests if for whatever reason a backer was unable to reply now (vacation, didn't see the update, etc.) till the end of this year. Hope that answers your question! @Derik, with all of the delays in the past on this and many other projects due to careless date estimations, it's imperative we give ample time for this phase to play itself out. We'll honor the schedule given and make several good-faith attempts to give backers due notice in the meantime as (quite frankly) many backers may have mentally turned off Kickstarter updates over the course of two and a half years. We're anxious to get this sorted out so that we can focus on the next few stages with respect to the actual unit. @Peter, thank you sir, confirmed. @Andy, to play this as safe as possible, we have given 21 business days for everything to be processed as stated in the update. This should be ample time for everyone that has yet to receive a pledge refund to receive one. We will be sending out the update several times in the next week to give everyone a chance to view it and have the opportunity to claim their pledges. Hope that helps! Hey Guys, Just to address a few of the most common questions: 1) To find your Amazon Transaction ID, log into your Amazon Payments account, and do a quick search for nov-dec 2011. It should pop right up. 2) When issued a refund, you guys are still our original backers and this will not effect your first-serve priority on future products as well as your lifetime discount with Cryptrade. More details on how to redeem discounts and identify yourselves during a potential purchase will be detailed in future updates. 3) We will not be doing another Kickstarter project for the CRXi or the CRXii. We will be selling this directly on Amazon using Amazon fulfillment as this will ensure timely deliveries. (And everyone knows how important that should be!) 4) I don't know who you guys have been talking to :P but yes, a CRXi will be available in burl walnut :P Tricky tricky backers! Let me know if you guys have any issues that need sorting out via email, I'll do my best to get back to you asap. Just in case it's not clear in the email, Our email is <email> Hello Backers, Refund Request email update has been sent a few minutes ago. Look forward to getting everyone situated and taken care of. If you guys have any questions try to drop me an email as it's much more efficient to address individual issues using threads. Have a great one! @Chris, LOL @Moritz, refund update will go out as planned on Tuesday at 10AM detailing how you and any other backer that has yet to be refunded can receive their refund in the quickest time possible. Trying to keep this efficient and as productive as possible so as not to have to repeat previous delays. I'll be able to take your questions throughout the weekend if I can assist with anything in the meantime. Have a great holiday. @Derik, sorry to hear that. Unfortunately the effect would have been the same with respect to the release today or on Tuesday as following the instructions would result in a refund in the same timeframe. We're giving everyone four different options to collect funds as we have informed that international backers (majority of our backers) won't be able to make use of Amazon transfers. More on that Tues. Hey guys, A mass email update will be going out on Sept 2nd, 10:00 AM EST due to Labor Day weekend. Apologies in advance for not being able to send this a few hours ago. The scheduled email will detail how to receive your refund for local as well as international backers. We'll be around all week to assist with any issues during that phase. Have a great holiday folks! Hello backers! Just a quick followup. A mass email update will be going out within 24 hours with details on the refunding rollout. Thanks for bearing with us as we get everything organized for everyone. Looking perfect Derik. Preparing a few things before we give everyone an update on next steps and instructions. Should have an email out by Thursday. @Leroy, thanks for checking in. Kindly refer to the previous two posts. Thanks. @Derik, Thanks for writing in and voicing your concerns. With respect to the transaction ID's, that would not have told us much on our end other than that a payment was posted. Refunds were given on various platforms and accounts in the past and we did not have access to all of this info until very recently. This is all insignificant at this point as we now know whom to issue refunds to and we're hoping to have this done this upcoming week give or take a few days. Hopefully after this phase we can start taking some engineering comments as we look forward to a fresh launch :) Thanks again. Hello Backers! Great news. We're done going through everything and very glad we did. We're hoping to begin the rollout of refunds to backers that have yet to receive one this upcoming week. We may have a few days expected delays while we take care of everyone so we do appreciate your patience at this time as we get everyone situated. Some backers might get direct emails during this time for certain clarifications however, these are very few and have no bearing on the rollout planned. We'll try to answer emails and messages as quickly as possible if anyone has any questions in the meantime and we look forward to your correspondence. Thanks again everyone, have a great one. @Dave, Thanks for your inquiry. We will be issuing refunds pronto to backers that have yet to receive one. Unfortunately theres no way to know this from our end other than going through any transactions we can get ahold of as Kickstarter itself does not have such information. The CRXi will be made available to Kickstarter backers still interested in receiving one will be notified prior to release when they are ready for direct sale. We still don't actually know what platform will be used exactly at this point however, Amazon e-stores do seem to have the necessary faculties to facilitate this. We're hoping we'll have more information for you and everyone else by tomorrow. Thanks again. @Chris, always good to hear from our backers. We're very aware of the stress everyone has had to endure throughout this project and we look forward to taking care of everyone as quickly as possible and highly appreciative of your patience. Feel free to drop us a line anytime and we'll do our very best to assist. Have a great evening. Hello Backers, Just wanted to let everyone know that we will not be releasing an update today as we have yet to compile our lists. We will however, be finished by tomorrow and will release an update then. Thanks for your patience while we get everything wrapped up. Have a great one. @Chris, no sir. We will be working on the CRXii after the Kickstarter models roll out and offering them directly when available via retail. @Derik, not quite sure if we have enough time before tomorrow to merit a mass email update. We're going through the numbers right now to make sense of everything and come back with the solution everyone has been waiting for. With respect to the CRXi - we hope to offer the original units to Kickstarter backers only for a duration. Extra units that are no longer wanted by their backers will go on sale on Amazon and through a new website we are working on. We will also be offering discounts to all original backers on future hardware moving forward. The CRXi is a pretty neat unit but the CRXii is (IMHO) much more practical to market and will feature wireless technologies and a new locking mechanism based on my combination lock mechanism - hopefully as soon as this mess is taken care of we can focus working with our backers the way a Kickstarter project was intended. We really like this new injectable amorphous metal alloy tech and think the CRXi will greatly benefit from the tight tolerances that can be provided using it. Will let you know asap! Thanks for stopping by. @Alexandr, Thanks for your question. The CRXi model will ship with original specs to utilize the boards previously procured. We will however, be offering various new capacities in conjunction with the originals. We hope to be able to branch out with the line offering to bring down costs by offering boards featuring software encryption and speedier protocols. We are also working on a secondary model that will be dubbed the CRXii that features another very different locking mechanism I worked on a few years ago that was unfortunately shelved when this project was delayed. Fun stuff! Hope that answers your question. @Michael, @Feng, Thanks for writing in. We're going to get you taken care of in short order. I'll have an update out by Tue latest with respect to refunds. Hopefully after this phase we can all put this behind us and focus on the unit and the changes planned. Appreciate your patience while everything is sorted out. able to* - V.S and were not to claim* (pardon, no editing on the comments section) Hello Backers, We have just received a list from Amazon (rather, we have received access) with respect to backers that have already been refunded. We're going to go over this over the weekend and cross reference it with with our backer info provided by Kickstarter. Other than the refunds issued due to backers canceling credit card payments, Paypal, and a few direct wires, we believe this represents the bulk of all backers that have yet to be refunded. For those backers that have emailed us not wishing a refund, we will be responding to those emails Monday. For those backers that have received refunds are were not able to claim the refunds due to being in a location Amazon does not allow transfers, we know who you are and will be contacting you. We may be able to arrange for the funds to be issued in a different way as Amazon will not be able to do anything. We will contact you directly come Mon. Kindly note however, that in the event that the funds were used on Amazon to make purchases, we will most likely not be able to assist unfortunately, further. Thanks again guys for your patience while we sort this mess out. Thankfully we're on the right track and will be getting back to everyone in the next few days (Mon, Tue). Have a wonderful weekend. @Jon, thanks for writing in. We'll have an update tomorrow by the latest as previously mentioned to a few backers earlier today and yesterday, we have been made aware of a lot of refunds we were not initially aware of. The numbers didn't add up and we have to make sure that refunds are only going out to backers that have yet to receive one. We understand that there has been miscommunication and the primary reason why we didn't quote you a specific date when asked. We should however, have one by the end of the day Sat. Thanks again for posting. @crypteks.com** Sorry about that. @Kicjobjob, that's what we thought. We were under the impression that payments were posted in December 11 and refunds happened a few months after. This was not the case. Refunds happened much later and from different accounts apparently. Our first list came from <email> however, we became aware of a secondary account <email>. Had no clue. We should have a new list later today and will definitely let you guys know as to the progress. Thanks again for checking in. @Tom, with all due respect Tom, how the heck else are we supposed to do it? Just purchase a company and then start randomly wiring people money? We need to know who pledged funds. We need to know who received refunds in the past. We need to know what was paid and what wasn't. We (I) appreciate the patience of everyone involved and look forward (you have no idea) to making sure everyone not refunded gets a refund so that we can finally move forward with the actual project. @Chris, no worries. Thanks again for taking from your time to write in. Much appreciated. @Chris, np. To clarify. We ourselves did not issue refunds. This was the previous team. Apparently through various updates some refunds were processed through direct refunds, others via the suggestion they cancel orders via credit card purchases made to Amazon. I understand your frustration and doing my best to make sure everything is very clear and fair. I should have a proper list before saturday. The only complication was the previous Amazon account which was tied to a now defunct email/URL as well as a company name change. Thankfully, Amazon is being really awesome. Will keep you posted. Thanks for writing in. @Chris. Thanks for bringing that up. Previous attempts at refunding backers (we count three) actually resulted in about 40,000USD in refunds. We have a list of backers, yes that is very correct. We are now sorting through which backers received refunds so that we can go ahead and roll out refunds to backers that were not. Some were refunded via ebay, Amazon, and some were refunded via actually canceling their payments (apparently this was suggested as well). Some accounts were set up via "Crypteks", others by the current "Cryptrade". Just sorting through everything and making sure everyone that needs taking care of is. A few backers in the upper tiers have suggested that they do not want refunds as funds were written off via companies. Pardon the lag but lots to do. Thanks again. @Preston. Thanks for checking in. Going to have to release the update in a bit. Spent most of the day yesterday with Amazon trying to get a specific list issued to the older company. Will be updating in a bit as we are updated ourselves. (Think that last comment was written in the AM :) @Tom, We're thinking carrier pigeon would have probably been a bit faster :) Most business checking accounts make less than 0.02% on these types of amounts. More info can be found at <url>"us", us is currently myself and the minority shareholders of S&B assets a subdivision of Safford & Baker PLLC in Michigan. This is common knowledge and readily available by the state. Please pardon in advance the use of "we" or "I" as they are interchangeable in this context with respect to Cryptrade. Force of habit :) Hey Derik. Just sent a lengthy reply to Heiko regarding a few issues. Unfortunately, aside from giving everyone our login credentials not really sure what to do here. When I first took over this project from the previous owners, we basically had no idea some things hadn't been done for close to three years. That's a long time for a "company" to not do basic things like accounting/tax filings etc. Plus the Amazon account itself was basically a mess because some backers were apparently told to ask Amazon to cancel their CC payments to facilitate a refund. This created a negative balance on Amazon obviously as all funds collected from Amazon go straight to a designated account. Furthermore, we didn't have direct access to the accounts. We still don't have access to the old email system or the website. This created a LOT of issues with resetting passwords, changing passwords, claiming accounts, etc. You guys have no idea. Even more worrisome, was that funds in overseas accounts were set up in ways we were not familiar with. We had to jump through quite a few hoops to prove we were indeed the new owners, and that the old owners no longer had any bearing on the company. Those are a few things we weren't aware of. What does this have anything to do with where we are now? Well, we basically had to restructure everything and yes, consolidate. What we initially thought would take a few weeks ended up taking an additional month and a half almost. Add to that the previous lengthy delays and miscommunication and obviously we're going to have problems with our backers. Had I known these issues at first I would not have issued a specific timeframe for refunding. As of today, we are going to stick to "relatively soon". I would love nothing more than to surprise everyone with a mass email tomorrow and say the time has come however, I will refrain until absolutely certain we are ready to roll. This is now a matter of days as opposed to weeks. The idea here is not to stall as suggested, there is no reason for us to stall. I could easily have given the team a longer rollout schedule however, there is no need anymore. We are (again, pardon the repetition and due facepalms) almost ready to rollout a refund to ALL backers that weren't able to receive one in the past. We really do want this over. It's stressful to have to respond to these types of comments or take the backlash of something we had nothing to do with in the first place as opposed to dealing with questions on engineering and feedback on a delivered unit (not that we don't understand where its coming from we do!). You guys are more than welcome to PM me with your specific questions. I'll try my hardest to give substantial answers when appropriate. And I really do appreciate you guys taking the time contacting us or commenting. I'm pretty sure its stressful for everyone involved but we're still adamant that this project can make it with a little care and dedication regardless of how things have been handled in the past. @Heiko, again thank you for commenting many many times. We greatly appreciate the effort. Unfortunately we can't typically address the same exact issue on every comment and are pleased to say that we are nearing the completion (as in, we are physically able to) of this phase (refunds). We understand that this arrangement may not be expedient enough for most backers however, we are not responsible for the previous delays and really look forward to actually moving forward with this project. You're welcome to PM us with your specific concerns and we can arrange for additional material to be provided if appropriate. This might better help bring to light questions of 1) why were there delays? 2) when can funds be released? 3) What will happen to the project after the refunding. We'd much rather engage in a constructive conversation at this point with our backers than resort to having to constantly reply to (very understandable) off comments. Thanks again for your emphatic input. Much appreciated. @JuTs, These delays are unforgivable and we are deeply sorry for the unforeseen delays especially given that this project has already been extremely delayed already. We have however been working diligently to provide constant communication and give everyone a basic heads-up with respect to whats going on. Thankfully, we're at a point where a lot of previous mistakes have been rectified and we are fairly confident that we will be ready to roll in a matter of days as opposed to weeks. Hopefully the transition from wholly neglected to back-on-track will be completed without further delay and we can focus on completing the project as envisioned. Thank you kindly for taking the time to voice your opinion, we appreciate the feedback. @Heiko, We're sorry we're not able to move at a more expedited pace and for the delays incurred previously. We are at the last stretch of our campaign and hopefully by providing a refund to yourself and everyone else, we can focus on more constructive feedback with respect to the actual product. By taking on this project we were fully aware of the consequences however, look forward to getting everything on track relatively shortly. Thanks for your feedback. @Zach, appreciate you writing in and letting us know how you feel about how things are being handled. We've been privy to quite a few Kickstarter campaigns and feel that being in direct communication with backers is a happy obligation on our part. By taking over this project we also took over the responsibilities of engaging with everyone. On that note, we're almost ready to commence as we have been laying the foundations required to complete this project over the past several weeks. It's been tough but we will have everything under wraps in short order. Thanks again for writing in. @Sam, @Derik, Thanks for the suggestions and the feedback. As always much appreciated. I think I'll do just that and make sure everyone knows we are active with the backer pool. Thanks again! @Mike, thank you kindly for writing in. Your feedback is very appreciated. @Derik, If only things were that simple :) Contrary to the implied (and a thousand apologies in advance for any assumptions), we have an obligation to actually complete the project and its not an issue of simply not having people engaged. As you can see, sending an email update or engaging comments on the comments section will see backer interaction all the same. When we took over this project we reached out to Kickstarter to better understand the platform and were advised to keep active on the comments section as this is the typical "center" if you will for backer interactions. Additionally, it was suggested that we refrain from sending (minor) updates via email and the reason is simple, many backers have opted out of receiving Kickstarter emails over the years as the system is relatively spammy. Aside form all that, I actually really like the product and want to see it go to market. It might not be something for mass consumption given the price and novelty of the product but I still feel strongly about it nonetheless. At this point, any and all input as to how we can better engage with our backers is most welcome and we appreciate the extra time you take responding and commenting over the weeks with your insight though in fairness and as aforementioned, we really want to see this product finished regardless of previous delays and hope we will be able to meet our current refunding goals relatively shortly. Thanks again. @DiMono, a scheduled update should be going out within the next 24 hours. Thanks for checking in. @Sam yve. @Rik thanks for checking and writing in. We have actually been posting quite frequent updates here in the comments section to better engage with backers and hopefully answer all the questions that we are able to. Thanks again. @Dave, scroll down a bit you may have missed an updated or two. Thanks for writing in. @Derik, I sincerely appreciate your commenting and your concerns are duly noted. I'm very glad to be able to address backer concerns and will not abandon this project or let it stagnate further. Really looking forward to clearing up this phase and get everyone comfortable and situated regardless of the slight hiccups we feel a lot of progress has been made in very short order. Responding promptly is the least I can do and should have been done from the beginning. Will keep you guys posted as planned. Thanks again. Sorry Sam, going to rewrite that sentence with the missing word. @Sam, I'm sorry I don't quite understand the question. Though I think you took "everyone" and "backers that pledged amounts" to mean separate things. Pardon the confusion - anyone that pledged funds previously to this project and "everyone" are one-in-the-same to us. Hope that clarifies. @M.G. Typically, wire transfers take 2-14 business days (sometimes even less in the U.S) depending on the type of transaction, where its going, and the amounts being transferred. In our case, wiring funds was not the issue however, the paperwork associated with transferring account ownerships from the previous owners to the new team required obtaining the proper documentation and in the cases of funds that were allocated overseas to procure parts, they had to be consolidated back home. Add on top of this really messy accounting and fragmented tax filings and we can begin to explain just some of the unanticipated delays. @Sam, I'm sorry I don't quite understand the question. Though I think you took everyone and backers that pledged amounts. Pardon the confusion - anyone that pledged funds previously to this project and "everyone" are one-in-the-same to us. Hope that clarifies. @Derik, I've been privy to quite a few KS project myself. Some go great in a few weeks (ideal!), others a few months even years. Recently a few have made headlines as they announced they will not be continuing the project and will not be issuing refunds. These projects have no bearing on the CRXi units. Our objectives are to refund backers and get the units to market with minimal delays while maintaining an open channel of communication and a steady stream of updates to everyone. We'd love nothing more to have this completed in a timely manner to allow us the time to focus on the production of the actual units however, we're also trying to clear up a messily handled project and undo quite a few mistakes. We have thankfully been able to take care of the bulk of what was not done previously. Physical parts as well as funds have been responsibly inventoried and allocated, dues and invoices taken care of. A lot of little things went wholly unattended for a very long time. The only "snag" I guess we've had to deal with was time. Preparing documents and notaries (etc.) took a little more time than we had anticipated mainly because we weren't aware of the fragmentation. Hopefully we can settle everything relatively soon with minimal delays to the benefit of everyone involved and begin focusing our attention on the project itself. We're really sorry you guys have had to deal with such long delays and if I were a backer I'd be more than a little frustrated with how things were handled. We really appreciate the opportunity serving everyone and hope when all is well, this project will be salvaged and we can focus our engineering expertise making cool new products everyone can enjoy (no more Kickstarters though! :) Thanks again everyone for taking the time to write in. Will be back with an update early in the week with concrete timelines and further details. Have a great one. Hello Backers, Just going to go ahead and respond to a few previous comments throughout the update as they touch base on the main points to be conveyed. @Tatsu, we are the refunding agency though I've taken this to mean Amazon/ebay/etc. We have been lucky enough to get everything in one place which took a little more time than we had anticipated. We've also set up various accounts (in most cases, re-established) and handled all of the prerequisite fillings with respect to taxes and general accounting. We are almost ready to start the issuing process. All that remains is transferring funds (or linking) to issuing third-party services and are currently waiting for a green-light. We do understand the frustration everyone has had to endure however, we are thankful that the major obstacles have been dealt with and we look forward to commencing shortly. We will be updating everyone via email when we are ready to start with a few details. We were hoping to begin the first of next week however, a concrete date will not be set today pending we are updated ourselves. Thanks as always for your time, especially the commenters reaching out with their questions (we had a lot to learn!) - this may seem an odd statement but we are a little new to the whole Kickstarter process as the new team missed out on a really awesome launch. Have a great one. @Toby, international backers and local backers are no different to us with respect to refunds. So, in short, yes. @Dave, We're working on just that. And do be completely honest, I'm not spending 196k :) I am simply making sure backers that pledged amounts for the CRXi units receive their payments back. My investments will take into effect after this phase with the manufacturing of the newly designed units. I'm sorry you and everyone else had to endure this for so long, I wish I had been able to do something much earlier however, this was not the case. I appreciate you writing in though and you're welcome to drop me a line any time if you need assistance with anything I'd be more than happy to help. Hello Backers, Small update: All accounts are currently successfully consolidated and we will be allocating funds across various e-pay platforms during the next few days. Updates as to progress will be going out randomly this week as we are updated ourselves. (We're so relieved you have no idea). Have a great one! @Sam, Trying our best to give out updates when we have them. Thanks for writing in. Hello Backers, As of this moment we have yet to have our wire posted. We're very hopeful that tomorrow will be more fruitful in this regard (assuming standard wiring protocols) - apparently they can take up to 5 business days typically. We will followup with this post tomorrow as we are updated ourselves. Hopefully we will begin to delve a little into next steps at that point as we will also be in contact with ebay and Amazon to get things rolling and revert back to everyone with a more accurate rollout schedule. Thanks for your patience! Almost there. @Peter, sorry we had to roll yesterday and today into a single post. Hello backers, This is will be in a series of mini-updates till Wednesday as we are updated ourselves. Our final wire has been made and we look forward to a final consolidation of all accounts by Tuesday the 15th. Our Amazon accounts have been re-instated as well as the ebay account. We have also opened a Western Union account allowing us to send payments internationally. We currently have no way to contact anyone outside of Kickstarter and a select few persons that have contacted us via outlook. This is not going to be an issue as we will handle all backers via Kickstarter. Backers will be given the option to receive an Amazon transfer, an ebay transfer, a Western Union transfer, and in the rare event that aforementioned cannot be received for whatever reason, we will work with that backer to find an appropriate solution. There is currently no need to send us any communication with a preference. We will circle back on this on Monday as well as Tuesday and Wednesday as we have more information. Thanks guys. As always, have a great weekend. Hello backers, Just a quick late-night update. We have FINALLY had all the respective accounts authorized and are ready to start sending funds from. We are also expecting the last series of transfers to go through within the next 48 hours. As soon as we are able to to post funds to the newly re-opened accounts we can commence as planned. We will be following up with this post on Friday evening (EST) with a status update. Have a great one. @Derek. Thank you for your insight and writing us. I try to refrain from judging other people so I won't be doing any blaming. What has occurred is unfortunate however, not unsalvageable. Still a pretty cool device IMO (a little biased of course). @George, I feel with you and hope to be able to change your mind about this project. Unfortunately "writing checks" as you put it requires an account you can do that from ;) We've had to sort out the mess left behind to be able to do a few things. Thankfully it's not rocket science though it did take a little longer than usual. I did't really have a need to take this project on or the responsibilities it respectfully entails, but I did and I'm very hopeful things will be turned around relatively soon. I decided to reach out to the backers and let them know what was up instead of doing more of the same. I really appreciate everyone for taking the time to voice their opinions, doubts, and encouragements. Progress is definitely being made and we remain dedicated to getting everyone situated and bringing everyone the product they wanted. Scheduled update for tomorrow. Thanks again. @Chris, not a problem - open communication is the best policy. As for most of these questions I could refer you to my first update here (37 I think?). I am Fahad, the original designer of the then "Crypteks USB". I am a product designer with a background in materials engineering. As for the former owners, they basically left the project to stagnate when (from what we assume) profit projections were not as expected with respect to the potential work involved with bringing a product to market. We assume that the initial 12,000 requested was to facilitate no more than 50 units - those could have easily have been milled by a small-scale company. Mr. Safford is a legal advisor to tech companies. He was originally commissioned to set up the registration documents of the the Crypteks, Inc. and assisted in the filling for the core IP patents. As for the take-over, as was stated before, I got quite a few complaints as to this project and as my name was attached to it I reached out to the previous owners and offered to take it off of their hands to sort things out and clear up any misconceptions propagated by a few misinformed individuals. Funds used so far have really only been used to purchase the boards. I decided that a minimal capital injection would allow me to refund the backers and give me the freedom to create the units by using the boards as leverage with our partners. This has proven successful however, the previous accounting (or lack thereof) has been a real issue as well as the timing issues with re-opening/opening new accounts and transfers (we hadn't anticipated the times required to be so lengthy on account of previous accounting and tax submissions) As for the boards, they are currently in the office waiting for some nice housings to call home :) I hope that answers your questions. Feel free to drop us a line at <email> if you need anything. Thanks again! @Chris, thanks for comment as you address a few important issues. Our main obstacles with the refunding has been setting up the appropriate accounts to facilitate U.S and international backers as they both have certain limitations. To add to this, previous records and accounting were not done. Tax filings for the year 2011, 2012, and 2013 were not done properly. Multiple accounts were set up (we have no clue why) in various countries where parts were to be ordered/manufactured. Additionally, we actually don't have direct access to backer details other than what we can gather from Kickstarter (mainly shipping addresses). Our approach has been 1) redo all the necessary fillings. 2) consolidate all accounting into a new account 3) file for corporate accounts with various financial institutions capable of catering to the refund process (locally and internationally) 4) make sure uncle same is happy with respect to fillings. When we took over ownership we had no idea things had been so neglected. We're 95% on track after-the-fact however, some approvals are taking a little longer than anticipated as well as back-wires. We will have an update hopefully before this Sat. with a more coherent schedule. Thanks again for writing in, let us know if there is anything else we can shed some light on. @Derik, thanks for checking in. A scheduled update will be going out later today. Production updates will not be going out till the refunding issue has been resolved and all bakers are situated. Thanks again. @Chanakya, we apologize if our predecessors weren't active on the comments section and this may have caused some confusion; we have been posting regular weekly updates on this section as suggested by Kickstarter to better engage with our backers by posting frequent status updates. We should have made that more clear to everyone and will include it in the next update. @Heiko, thank you for commenting. It's always a pleasure to get feedback from one of our backers. @Derik, thank you for your clarification :) (We were referring to the 80+ emails we have received) - though we appreciate you taking the time to write. Thanks again! @Chris, you sir, are awesome. Kickstarter is an amazing platform that encourages ingenuity, brews creativity, and exemplifies the most noble of characteristics - charity. There are always exceptions to every rule however, we implore everyone to look beyond the mistakes and mismanagement of a few as they do not in any way represent the spirit and dedication of so many talented people. We will do our utmost to live up to these expectations and we find the whole process extremely rewarding (albeit new and very challenging). Thank you and everyone else that continues to lend us their kind words of encouragement - we really appreciate it. Dear Backers, First and foremost, thank you all for your kind words and letters of support. You guys are awesome and make our work that much more interesting. We are still waiting for the finalization of our main Cryptrade account to commence the roll-out. We had sincerely hoped this would have been finished already however, we seem to have slightly under-estimated the time it would take. We are hoping this will be finished within the next few days and we will circle back with an update as soon as this milestone is reached. Until then, kindly accept our most sincere apologies for this slight delay. We will most likely be posting another update within 72 hours to keep everyone posted and we appeciate your patience. As always, thank you all for your support, we look forward to your messages and questions and will do our best to get back to everyone as quickly as possible. Have a great one! Hello Backers, We were hoping to have something new to report by today but it seems that we will need to circle back on Tuesday during the weekly update - we still don't have a green-light though we expect this to clear up in the next few days. @Zach, you guys are very much welcome. We try to put ourelves in your place and expect at least the very least, consistency. Thanks for writing in. @Sam, we think (hope!) everyone will be pleased with the final outcome. Stay tuned. Have a great weekend folks. Hello Backers, This is going to be a rather short update hence no need for a mass-mailed update. As of today the accounts we have secured are not ready to send funds from. We had originally marked this week for the rollout however this is unlikely as of today. We will however strive to get everything in order this week therefore we will be scheduling another update for this Friday to replace the scheduled one today as opposed to one on Tuesday. In the meantime, we will continue to keep everyone posted in the event we have any pertaining details. We appreciate your patience however, kindly note that a lot of complications had to be corrected with respect to previous management. We are pleased with the progress made this far and greatly look forward to getting everyone situated. As always, have a great one. @Sam, thank you and answers to those important questions are scheduled as updates as soon as we clear up the refunding process. We will divulge that newer molding technologies utilizing various metallic glass (amorphous metal alloys) are being considered. Final finishes are aplenty and we will strive to provide our backers with several options. Hope that helps. @David, we've been posting minor updates here under the comments section (you can view them by scrolling down a bit). We have yet to issue any refunds to anyone though an update will be going out on Tuesday to clarify the rollout. Thanks for writing in. @Jeff, you are very welcome sir. We're very excited to get everyone situated (though sorting through the previous mess has been... challenging to say the least). Thanks for writing. Dear Backers, As per our minor weekly update, we will most likely be commencing the refund process next week. We had hoped to start this week unfortunately new accounts had to be opened and approved which took a few days. We appreciate your patience. We should have more details next week which we will be elaborating on appropriately (update number 41). Thanks for your time, have a great one. @Kie, no problem. Thanks for checking in @Travis, we're actually going to issue funds to all backers to ensure we have a fresh start with everyone. All backers will have a priority to order units when they are made available. Pricing and availability will be announced shortly after the refund process to everyone interested. Thanks for writing in. Hello Backers, Everything looks to be on track as planned though rollouts should start around the middle of this month. We're currently processing our own payments and everything is all set up. A few trouble accounts will be resolved via email - there are a few backers that can't receive Amazon payments or PayPal either. These will be processed differently and you will be notified via mail. We're scheduled for another update same time next week. Thanks and as always have a great one. (We'll have sorry!) Hello Backers. Just a small update today. We look to be on schedule with refunds though it looks to be closer to mid-June at this time. We still have yet to receive a proper solution with Amazon (international) but we have a few contingencies in place - more on that next week. Thanks to everyone that has sent us kind words; we really appreciate it and look forward to overcoming the obstacles this project has faced in the past. (And yes! We will be finishing the units and yes everyone that backed this project will have priority). We plan on making 2500 units initially and 500 of the CRXii. Thanks again, we're have another update same time next week. Your comments/questions are always welcomed anytime. Have a great one. Hello backers. We wanted to do a quick followup today though a bit short so we've opted to use the comments section. Refunds look to be on schedule for near mid-June. We should have quite a few options for everyone on that front and we look forward to getting everyone situated. We'd like to thank all the backers that took the time to leave a comment to help us get organized. Kindly note that we now have complete records for every backer that has yet to receive a refund so there is no further need to post a request - thanks again we appreciate you guys taking the time to drop us a line. We may have a minor update going out to a few international backers later this week with respect to processed refunds with withdrawal issues; we may have a solution for these cases. Thats about it for the tine being. Thanks to everyone that wrote in with words of encouragement. We look forward to taking care of the refunds and focusing on actual production. As always, we may be reached via mail or Kickstarter messaging anytime for assistance or questions. We're scheduled for another update same time next week. Have a great one! @George Thank you, noted. @Martin thanks for contacting us. Yes as a matter of fact refunds will be issued to everyone. Kindly refer to the last two updates for additional information that may pertain to you. Thanks again. @Tom, thanks for letting us know. @Peter thanks for the update. Your messages have been well received however kindly refer to the last two updates for further details with respect to the process. Everyone is being refunded there is no need for a request though thanks again for letting us know. @Dana Epp, thanks for that. With the volume of emails we receive on a daily basis we noted in the previous update that all email submissions have been well received - but thanks for checking in with us. On that note, we will definitely keep everyone posted on the unit status. All original backers will have first pick with respect to purchasing a unit. More on that in the upcoming updates. @Chris, @Michelle, thanks for that. You're all set (and you're very welcome, thank you) @WEEKA, as per the last update, all emails received have been reviewed (yours included) and we thank you for following up. @Derik, thanks for that. Our update requested folks try to contact us to help us sort out the mess of records we have access to. We're trying to figure out 1) who received a refund so far 2) of those who wasnt able to use said funds. We've enlisted the help of both KS and Amazon staff. We're working to find the best solution to handle everyone however its a daunting task especially since everything was in a jumble. We'll sort it out and get this rolling. Thanks for checking in. Thank you everyone that took their time to get back with us. You're all set. Kindly note that there is no need at this time to inform of us of a refund request; this is the default plan at the moment though we really appreciate you contacting us. Thanks again. @egooijen, @Seth, @David. Thanks guys you're all set. @Heiko, Cryptrade has been purchased from the previous owners. Thanks for stopping by. @Oracz, @Dauzon, @Andrew, thank you for getting back with us, we have you guys down. @Andrew, we're waiting word from Amazon for any potential solution they have in place for this type of situation. We'll update everyone as planned with further information and appreciate your patience while wrapping everything up. Thanks again. @Christine, we're sorry to hear that, truly are. We have you down thank you kindly. @Cedric, @Peter, thanks guys. We already have you down. On that note, I think almost everyone here would have wanted the units and I look forward to making that happen. Thanks again. @Clive, Thank you for updating us. We are currently talking to Amazon to see what options are available to us on this front. We will update everyone the minute we have a tangible option. Rest assured the issue is being dealt with amongst other similar problems. @ER, Thank you for letting us know the situation. We have yet to receive a definitive from Amazon on what solution we will be able to offer everyone as we apparently have an issue with international backers not being able to use their funds. We will get back to everyone with respect to this issue on the next update hopefully. Thanks again. @Dave Thank you for dropping us a line. @kicjobjob Apparently some of your postings violate the Kickstarter TOA. Posting links to third-party sites if i'm not mistaken is against aforementioned as well as rapid posting/trolling or releasing of potentially slanderous conjecture. We advise at this point that any issue that you wish clarified be brought up in an official correspondence and if said response has any bearing on this project we will be most willing to post the results as an update to everyone if said information is deemed appropriate or aids in the fulfillment or expedience of the current project goals. Your comments and correspondence are always welcome however and I look forward to you responding to mine in the appropriate time to kindly correct your facts. Thanks for your time. @Heiko, We are in the process of gathering the correct numbers for this project which should come to a conclusion later today with the Amazon results. We have no plans to withhold refunds from backers on the basis of manufacturing. Funds will be refunded irregardless of what we end up doing with the boards. With respect to the contract; you're welcome to contact us via email where that information can be provided to you - there are statements of share transfers FYI which you are more than welcome to be a privy to. With respect to photographs; we can include these in an update sure no problem though we've already ascertained that they were purchased. With respect to the part about Amazon; sorry I don't see a question there however we are in contact with Amazon to figure out who got refunded, and of those that were issued refunds, how many of them were international customers that were unable to use said funds (we had no idea this was an issue until we saw various refunds in limbo). With respect to deadlines; we will be posting a timeline as soon as we know our numbers; this is not going to be a lengthy ordeal. With respect to your opinions; I am motivated to see this through due to various reasons - this project has created a lot of grief for me when instead I should have been proud of the success of one of my inventions and the attention it garnered. The current state of things is unacceptable and will be rectified immediately and hopefully when everyone is taken care of I will consider if at all, how and when to release this invention to the public for retail. Thank you for giving us your two-cents and we have your information. @Andy Thank you for getting back with us. @Warren, @Neil, thanks for checking back with us. You're all set. @Andy, we have been in contact with Amazon and Kickstarter. Unfortunately a good deal of backers that were issued refunds were done so via various ways and we don't have access to previous domains or email correspondences. We don't have those records. We are asking Amazon to assist in filtering who got what and when so that we have a better list to go by. Unfortunately I cannot make excuses for the previous management however look forward to taking care of what needs fixing. @Anonybook, Everyone is being refunded. Backers still wishing to own one will have that chance when they are made. The only issue we have now is figuring out who was already issued a refund. From what I can see thankfully you were issued one already. Thanks for checking in. @Jon. A lot of innocent people were hurt due to this project. What started out as a cool invention has led to be a huge personal loss and a publicity nightmare. We look forward to reaching the end of this project to the satisfaction of everyone still involved. @Heiko Any backer that has pledged to this project or any project for that matter deserves a reward/refund. The reason for this update is more closely associated with "right thing to do". Each and every backer deserves his/her/their due and no credit should be given to any particular person rather credit to everyone that has been unjustly inconvenienced by mismanagement a gross lack of respect. Hello backers! Kindly see update number 38 for important information regarding this project. We thank you for your patience and look forward to assisting everyone. We will try to answer everyone in an acceptable timeframe however may not be so quick on the comments section due to the hand-off. Hey guys, Update as to the refund process is out. We'll try to answer all of your emails as quickly as possible for those requesting assistance. A short update will also be sent out in a few minutes explaining how one would be able to get their Amazon Transaction ID. @Q8GEEK, backers wishing to remain backers will be given an update hopefully in a few short days. There will be some serious changes as to the parameters of the initial project including an update from USB 2.0 to 3.0 as well as the ownership and management of Cryptrade. Inc. More details on that later hopefully. We'll make sure every continued backer is taken care of :) Hey everyone! Update as to the refund process today/tomorrow. . We had an issue with some former backers that had received previous refunds previously and would be able to use the automated refund process to get an additional refund. . Kindly follow directions on the Official update once it has been sent! We are already severely behind schedule and it would be very inefficient to other backers if the refund process is not followed properly (we'd have to double check transactions manually, ensure all backers were verified, etc.). . And be nice to S&B! (Looking at you Adrian! lol). They're excellent people that offered their services to a customer! There's no need for all of that. Refunds will be processed properly, rewards will be issued for the inconvenience and extreme patience! Everything will be in order as soon as everyone is properly situated. . Thanks again everyone for being so patient! Kindly stay tuned for the update with the required details! Apologies* (oops) @Moritz, Pretty much everything. More on that on the next update. For now its time to take care of this messy project and get everyone back on track. Again, many apologize while we take care of our backers at this point. @Ronald We will in fact complete this project. The business model has not changed however management has. Unfortunately due to many delays quite a bit of our backers were dissatisfied therefore refunds were suggested so as no to upset anyone. We will have more on that in the coming days. @Nate, we pardon the inconvenience, we're trying to hasten the refund process for everyone that wishes to receive one. Thanks for your patience at this point. LOL, hey guys :) @Nate, Zach, Juts, (Adrian? LOL)... update for the refund process is on track. It's not much of a process other than deciding how you guys would like to get your refunds. As we have said in the last update, we ourselves will not be handling this and it should be hassle-free. Will get back to everyone in a few days with an status update. Thanks for your patience everyone! Just a friendly reminder to everyone. There is no need to send any information at present for refunds. The refund process will be sent to every backer and will include a minor authentication and request for refund route. We understand that the update was a little lengthy but in short, once the system is in place, refund request forms and gateways will be sent to all backers wishing to opt for one. With that said, thank you all for your patience and happy holidays! Have a great one! @JuTs Sorry to hear that. We know at least there was an issue for you to withdraw funds from Amazon. Backers that had requested refunds were granted them (some even posted on comments about it). @Kicjobjob maybe you should create a project here on Kickstarter?? :) Merry Christmas everyone! @Sebastian Unfortunately there is no answer to that question. That's the truth. ETA's are dependent on quite a few variables that are out of our hands at this point. We do understand the frustration and it is well deserved. We will do our very best to answer your question in the next update. Hope that helps! @Sam There will be no loss. Each and every unit will be manufactured according to our original plan. (Of course, it was never our plan to be delayed!) :) @Sebastian The only idiots here are ourselves for not being in a position to communicate with our backers the way we had wished. We will be sending out an update with respect to the units and ETA's in a few days, thanks for bearing with us! @Sam, actually its a net-zero loss (less what Kickstarter and Amazon took). Units sold on the open market will fetch higher prices anyways as there is no approximate 9% merchant loss. Units bought on Kickstarter are much cheaper than they would be on the outside. There was no profit intended on the Kickstarter units. Hope that helps! @Farzan So sorry to hear that, hopefully 2013 will be kinder to everyone :) Start the new-year with a fresh effort and clean slate! @Dave, nor ours! Might see them in baskets though ;) (and no, I won't take ANY responsibility for another deadline! lol) Happy Holidays guys! (And some of you were right! Holidays DID bring us out haha). Sorry for the confusion/delays everyone. We sent out an update to everyone and hope it summarizes a few key points pertaining to this project and our backers. Hope you guys have a great one! @Mortiz sheeesh!! relentless! :) It's all good, we needed the wakeup from you guys! Have a great one! @Toby We would never insult anyone and of course we would appreciate the same reciprocal sentiment. There have been delays, there have been mishaps, lack of communication, many promises were made that were not met; however we have remained dedicated and do the best with what is available always. Personal attacks and non constructive feedback however is uncalled for. There are always appropriate ways to get a point across. We've backed tens of projects on Kickstarter over the course of this past year and feel our project has faced several challenges similar to others with similar delays and similar general lack of experience. We don't see the level of displeasure that we seem to get here. Most of it our fault? Yes of course. We have launched a project that is very much delayed and our backers have rights to know the why's and where's and the how's. But regardless of our faults and misgivings, we're here :) We're here and remain working on this project and will do so till its completion. @George Don't worry about such silly endeavors, We're all fairly available and active online :) It's a shame though that such immature slander was a part of our project. Such a shame. Hey guys, . We're still here and quite frankly appalled by the type of comments being generated on the comments section. In general we're about finished and we're finishing the final steps required for shipping the units. We do not however feel that the backers that were sent refunds and could not withdraw their funds have any right to questions our motives or team members. Sorry guys, but that goes far and beyond the scope of this project. Yes we are very much late but then again, so are 90% of kickstarter projects. We don't need to remind you that the BBB has informed us we have done nothing wrong, our legal council has informed us that we have not done anything illegal and Kickstarter TOS (though a little forgiving) does not include any statutes for a situation even remotely similar to ours (hence, we are not in the red). We will continue to complete this project providing everyone with a unique unit not available the world-over and we will remain steadfast with our promises to deliver in the quickest time possible. We do pardon our lack of communication however it seems almost futile to please backers that do not understand the situation or question specific individuals and try to release personal information of non-members to an understandable aim (though, you're more than welcome at this pont). We're here and answer direct correspondence in the best fashion possible when appropriate. Thanks for those backers that have notified us of the filth taking place on the comments section. We're not afraid to answer questions and are always reachable. Otherwise, we kindly would like to mention to our backers; we're obligated morally or otherwise to make a unique product and deliver said product. We're not obligated to provide justification, solace, sentiment, or otherwise. Backers whom have issues with the aforementioned are more than welcome to contact us via our listed phone number, registered adress, or at <email>. We were fairly clear back in April that our project had undergone delays and that interested backers should request a refund via the appropriate avenues. We will not be commenting as a few backers have abused that privilege. Official correspondence will always be welcome and we apologize sincerely for their behavior. Any official updates will be done through the Updates section when appropriate. Thank you all for your understanding. Official emails will be answered via <email> with respect to shipping or billing issues. Thank you for your time. -Cryptrade Team Hey guys, Just a few minor points: With respect to refunds, international backers that received refunds prior to the April 5th deadline (and that was the deadline), had an issue collecting as Amazon Payments doesn't allow transfers to bank accounts outside of the U.S. This is an ongoing issue and we have nothing to do with it. We're trying to set up a viable solution to this situation (check, money order?). All refund requests were processed when they were supposed to and we'll address each one appropriately. . With respect to the CAD files - we've had them since prior to the Kickstarter project. They were required for both the renders, the SLA prototypes, as well as the patent application :) We're currently drafting NDA's for the backers that requested they would like to take a look at them. You're all more than welcome to be a part of this process and we really REALLY hope a few of you have some great suggestions (especially other engineers). We have no qualms with transparency, you main issue is really our serious lack of know-how when it comes to manufacturers. We get yanked around every 5 mins and a lot of promises made to us were never fulfilled. Wish you guys would step in and help us out! It's really not an issue of competence, it's way more an issue of (woah! 300 for a part! say wha!) - You guys are too generous and your continued commenting (albeit not always due to how wonderful we're doing) - is always welcome and much appreciated. We'll do our best to post the pics that were requested. :) Will let you know what happens with SlingShot after our call tomorrow/day after. Thanks for your patience guys! @Will NP :) Oh, also, there seems to be some sort of issue with resetting passwords on the Vault system when a user has forgotten their security answers. We're looking in to the best solution for having that reset. @Sam We actually won't know till Weds. We'll let everyone know the minute we have more info. Hey guys! We have some cool news coming from SlingShot Product Development Group in a bit. We'll be posting this via the updates section. A lot of your questions will be answered and hopefully everyone will understand a bit more why we've been delayed for so long and what solutions they will be providing. As for a few questions 1) Manufacturing is done exclusively in the States. Assembly is also done in the States. We probably won't be able to keep that up for mass produced units but for the time being, we're 100% made in the US. 2) Our springs, were no-quoted A LOT! Slingshot has updated the design to facilitate a feasible part. The springs are responsible for the "clicking" sounds of the wheels and are very important to the overall functionality. 3) Memory capacities have and will always continue to be an issue. We have taken the decision to offer free memory upgrades to all of our Kickstarter backers. These upgrades will be in the form of a new "key" that will be delivered upon final completion. It's a very expensive investment but we really owe it to everyone for being patient. 4) We're working on this and we're still here and we're going to deliver regardless of how many complaints we get and regardless of how crappy our communication is! (we seriously know and a Bajillion pardons!!!) There's really no excuse other than we're swamped with work. 5) We'll be offering a forum for our backers to sign NDA's for anyone interested in seeing the core CAD files. We had a few backers requesting it and thought you guys might benefit from seing just how complex the parts and tolerances really are. Anyone interested should send an email to <email>. You guys are welcome to try and mill one :D @anyone interested in stopping by: Office doors are open anytime, we'd love to talk to our backers and you're welcome to drop us a line anytime to set up an appointment. 6) Anyone who forgot their security questions need to reset them via their confirmed email addresses. In the event this can't be done, kindly drop us a line and we'll take care of it as soon as possible. 7) For some odd reason we don't get notifications (push notifications) from Kickstarter any longer. Speediest way to contact us is via email (<email>). Other than that, hold up peeps. We may suck at commenting on the comments section but SlingShot is definitely more than capable of handling these units to the required specs. Have a great one guys, and don't forget to write in if you need the CAD files, thanks again! @Nicholas Just got your FB msg :) Will send you a Kickstarter PM with details. You're more than welcome to stop by :) @Anonybook: So do we!! lol. Hopefully by that time everyone will see what a cool project this was and we might be able to afford staffing HR and CS :D Backer(s)? Lol... have a great weekend guys. You speak too soon esteemed backer :) Check your email. Shortly mean Monday JuTs. We're sorry your country is not supported via Amazon Payments. We will be issuing the refunds to the 4 remaining international backers via Western Union or Money Gram. Thank you for your understanding. Sorry guys, we really don't know what to say anymore lol. It seems the best way to contact us for a legitimate reason is through private message or email. We're really sorry about all that. Hey guys. We have not taken a decision to refund anyone, that will probably be done tomorrow or Friday the latest. As far as we're concerned this project is still a definite go and the refund is issue is being debated. Will let you know via official update. For those backers requesting that they be issued, kindly contact us via kickstarter messaging and it will be noted. Thanks again, and thanks for all those who submitted some really nice messages :) Made all the difference. @Larry @Will You guys are very right. We have a horrible track record when it comes to communication. We're a tiny team doing a monumental task. We'll post what we have and update everyone very shortly. @Anonybook, you have been refunded kindly check your Amazon account. @Anonybook. You're more than welcome to do any research that amuses you. We might give you a little advice also that a class action lawsuit requires punitive damages to have been incurred. We think you mean you'd like to petition for a refund (which, perhaps if you would bother checking your Amazon account, was granted at the behest of the moderators). Also, the BBB would be more helpful with your undertaking than the Department for Homeland Security is responsible for terrorist attacks, man-made accidents, and natural disasters. Though as someone openly affiliating themselves with Anonymous, you probably already know that as they've been interested in that group for some time now. . @Everyone, we're deeply sorry for these posts. Kickstarter admins have been petitioned for suspension as this qualifies as harassment under the Terms of Service. Thank you for your collective patience and understanding as this issue is taken care of. @Scott We're appreciative for every backer that showed their support. If we have to accomodate a single backer, then that is exactly what we are going to do, as a matter of principal. We're only curious as to why the encryption crowd is so unforgiving comparative to other projects we've personally backed. They update in a similar fashion to what we have been doing. They are delayed pretty much as long as we have been, and face many similar challenges. It's flattering to be honest. We're just sorry we couldn't accomodate shipment faster. Thankfully all of our funds are accounted for (and then some), our corporate structure is well founded, and we are adhering to the rules and regulations set forth by this platform. Suggestions of fraud and conjecture is literally insulting. A simple refund request could take care of any dispute or claim. On that note, we also firmly stand by the integrity of all of our company members, affiliates, and shareholders. It's just plain rude to suggest fraud because a few of the founding members are international. Department of Homeland Security? That made legal rofl. We might be able to find a solution for manufacturing or even give a few freebees, but finding one for prejudice is beyond the scope of this project. We are collectively apologetic to the majority of our backers, whom are incidentally, international. The suggestion of a class-action is whimsically silly; backers wanting refunds were given the opportunity (and completely of our own doing as we are not required to) and we'll probably do it again to accomodate additional backers. It would behoove anyone interested to at least do a little due diligence as to the term and perhaps read the TOA & FAQ on Kickstarter.com (<url>"I haven't gotten my reward yet. What do I do? The first step is checking the Estimated Delivery Date on the project page. Backing a project is a lot different than simply ordering a product online, and sometimes projects are in very early stages when they are funded. If the Estimated Delivery Date has passed, check for Project Updates that may explain what happened. Sometimes creators hit unexpected roadblocks, or simply underestimate how much work it takes to complete a project. Creators are expected to communicate these setbacks should they happen. If the creator hasn’t posted an update, send a direct message to request more information about their progress, or post a public comment on their project asking for a status update." . Sorry again guys for the nature of these posts. We are collectively frequent bloggers and big fans of anti-trolling. Our absence on the comments section is due to being all over trying to complete this project. The funds raised on Kickstarter although greatly appreciated, is not something we'd go AWOL over. We will be posting via the updates section as soon as options are available to those backers that wish to remove themselves from this project. We also recommend that backers that don't wish to add anything constructive to this project, to refrain from speaking on behalf of others. We get feedback from many backers almost daily and rest assured, we have a strong backing for which we are ever vigilant. @Shantanu LOL, I don't you've ever driven in the snow before :) @Scott, we'll most likely be offering the few backers that wish it, a refund. There are several hundred supporters that still wish to see this project come to fruition. We'd be willing to refund everyone that wished it and pay the additional expense from our own pockets if that needed be. It would be wise this time around for backers that do not wish to wait any longer to go ahead and make arrangements. We're interested in finishing a very important undertaking. Your fellow backer even pointed out they wished to knock us off but realized it was too complex and would cost quite a substantial amount of money well beyond what was raised on Kickstarter. We weren't joking when we said we paid a lot from our own capital. ;) We'll let everyone know via official update what options are made available. Thanks for feedback. @Anonybook We don't need to prepare anything at all as we are operating within the rules designated by this platform. Though we do appreciate your initial pledge, we kindly request that matters pertaining to your dissatisfaction be brought to the correct pathways, i.e you may wish to send us an official correspondence, Kickstarter staff, or Amazon payments. As you and many other backers have paid via credit card, you may always dispute the transaction. We have afforded refunds on different occasions and we feel we are moving in the right direction towards fulfillment however late that might be. There are however several hundred other backers aside from yourself that we must consider, many of whom have expressed much interest and support for this project. We will not see it fail due to conjecture. . @Chris you may change your shipping address as many times as you require. We will notify everyone a few days prior to shipping that we are about to ship and everyone will have a chance to update their addresses accordingly. The latest update will be your acting shipping address, hope that answers your question. Thanks again for being with us everyone, and we sincerely apologize for the latest happenings on this page. Kickstarter staff is investigating a potential solution. @Anonybook, These facts were brought up at the beginning of this project and the company affiliates and organizers are public knowledge. Bitwize SARL is based in Lebanon as stated many times before and were responsible for all of the video renders as well as concepts. Mr. Badawi is the CEO of the aforementioned company as well as a shareholder in Cryptrade Inc. This was acceptable to Amazon Payments, to the IRS, the State of Michigan, and Kickstarter.com. We're proud to have them on board and they have fulfilled their product concept delivery and an award winning website to boot ;) Kickstarter requires U.S based companies as Amazon does not offer payment services outside the U.S. As a whole; Cryptrade Inc. for all intents and purposes is a U.S based company with HQ based in MI. Mr. Randy Safford along with his partners are shareholders as well as acting legal council (same great gents that managed to prevent the naming challenge faced at the beginning). . In any event, everyone that has worked on this project is proud to have been a part of it and every member stands by our fulfillment obligations. Though late and not to the liking of some of our backers, whom were offered refunds and declined, this project is still within the guidelines set forth by Kickstarter. For those backers unaware of Kickstarter guidelines, kindly refer to the Kickstarter homepage. Several projects launched during the same timeframe as this one have faced similar challenges and their projects have still not come to fruition. This is definitelya not an excuse or being late, however illustrates the fact that several startups face many unique challenges that were not anticipated. Regardless of how a few disgruntled backers seem to feel, we will be notifying everyone of a decision to offer refunds (again) to those backers whom have been inconvenienced by our delays and no longer wish to be a part of this project. We are not obligated to do so however have (and might) do so to alleviate the situation. Frankly, there are still hundreds of supporters vouching for this project to succeed. For those who have been waiting patiently, many thanks, and thank you as always for your kind support. We will be addressing these issues immediately. Thanks again. Yes and no. Slingshot asked us for close to 60,000 USD to re-do the tolerances on the unit to facilitate an easier milling process. We were under the impression ages ago that when we initially paid them that this was taken care of. Part of the reason we get so delayed is our lack of knowledge and foresight into these matters. For us, it's as simple as some of our backers suggest, i.e, have the drawings, price it and mill it. We were ohhhh so wrong about that. The precision we required of the unit and the manufacturing process proved extremely expensive. We've already thrown more at this project from our own pockets than we raised on kickstarter. Had the original 75 units or 12,000k been raised as we had hoped been achieved, we would have covered our initial expenses at Christmas and had a few unboxing videos on New Years day :) But, (and somehow, thankfully) we were overwhelmed with orders. This is wholly our fault for not having the foresight of how complicated things could get when dealing with such orders. We just want to finish this ordeal, make our backers happy and give them a nice product. Instead, we're overwhelmed and our backers are dissatisfied with our communication, which sadly stems from us having to run around chasing manufacturers and trying to find solutions to issues that were supposedly ironclad. Vicious cycle, and we're just really sorry to everyone that had so much faith in us and we let them all down. @Sam, havent had a chance to look at Kickstarter messages for a bit, we got stiffed by our manufacturer who suddenly gave us a quote for close to 900$ a unit as opposed to the 104$ we were first promised. Been a little hectic around here. We'll have that taken care of immediately. Thanks again. @Sam We were just made aware of this, it is a compatibility issue with a few browsers that have recently updated. Should be up and running fairly shortly. Thanks for bringing it up :) @Deff, thank you for your thoughts. Again, we will be updating everyone shortly. Hey guys, Just got a panicked phone call! @Anonybook Though we appreciate your concern over the integrity of this project, we will be addressing the refund issue with an official update within 48 hours. Theres no need for you or any inconvenienced backer to make confrontational threats over the integrity of this project, project members, or affiliates. Though we are obviously late on our initial projected deadlines, and though you and many backers have the absolute right to be frustrated, we have and always will stand by this project, our team, as well as our promise to ensure no backer will go unrewarded or unaccounted for. . We apologize to the rest of our supporters if our lack of communication is the cause of the tone and confrontational nature of some of the comments being left on this page. We have been in contact with Kickstarter staff to ensure we are still adhering to the terms of agreement of Kickstarter.com and though we may be at fault for being non-communicative, we are definitely not in breech of the terms granted us by the Kickstarter platfrom (however inconvenient that may be). Our offices are registered and in good standing, anyone that feels the need to make silly accusations or rumor mongering is always welcome to stop by ;) . In retrospect to what is going on here by a few backers, a board decision as to offer refunds is underway and the terms of such an undertaking if offered (again) will be sent via official update in the next 48 hours. We feel we were clear when we offered our first round of refunds that delivery is hindered and should be expected very late. Refunds were offered freely and without penalty losses due to Kickstarter commissions and Amazon commissions; we paid out of pocket in respect to our backers. . Again to everyone, we apologize how this has somehow turned so ugly. We're very ashamed of this fact and deeply remorseful that our absence was taken somehow as a con and not of hard work trying to reward everyone that showed us their kindness and support. We will be sending out an official correspondence to all backers shortly, thank you to everyone that made an effort to contact us and offer advice with regard to the happenings on the comments section. Hey Guys, . Pardon the absence, been a hectic few weeks. Just a minor update: @Larry @Zach, We'll try to post a few pics relatively soon. We'll be doing the whole process of milling, assembly, packaging, as soon as everything is ready we'll let everyone know. Thanks for everyone that updated their shipping addresses during this time. For those who haven't yet, kindly do so :) We'll send out an official reminder a few days before we're ready to start shipping. . With respect to the few backers that were issued refunds outside of the U.S and were not able to access funds via Amazon.com: We will be sending out Western Union money transfers and you will be contacted shortly for your details. We thank you for your patience while resolving this issue. . Aside from that, thanks everyone for your patience! We're almost at the end of the project and we're really excited :) Thanks again everyone! Enjoy the rest of the week! @JuTs LOL! Still having trouble getting your funds out of your Amazon account? We could always cancel your transfer and put you back in the list ;) Let us know how we can help. Thanks guys for all the support :) A lot of the negativity was probably due to our updating skills (or lack thereof) but we were always 110% confident about completion. @Justin, thank you for the kind words and as a matter of fact, we do have a few additional units available for anyone interested. :) @Travis Will do ;) You can count on it! @Kevin We've had that suggestion many times from various backers. We try lol. Hopefully we'll have 2 more major updates till everyone gets their units and THEN we can go to the beach :) More often than not, we are disappointed by our vendors and it gets to the point that we really don't know what to tell everyone. Obviously it's a huge shortcoming and the experience has taught us the value of transparency. Thanks for the suggestion, we'll do our best to at least get the project over with and units in your hands without the need for "too many updates" :D @Chris, @Sam - Thanks :) Told ya Chris! ;) @Zach no need for apologies! We're apparently REALLY bad at updating you guys and for that we owe YOU the apology :) Update has been sent! - Thanks Em! (You too Randy!) @Sam We will be using a mix of UPS and FedEx (a few will be sent via DHL). We had quite a few orders and many in countries with various restrictions. This update will encompass the boards and an estimated ETA for the first shipments (which will be going out to backers in order). Backers that pledged first will get their units a little sooner than those whom supported the project at a later date. Our next update will have the locking mechanisms prior to final assembly (for those units that have been completed). The update should be going out fairly soon :) It's being uploaded right now :) We're thinking 80,000 worth of hardware encrypted PCBA boards is just what everyone needs to know their investment in this project is being taken very seriously. We're not very vocal but we're doing some amazing things and tough we're being (righteously) criticized, we feel the ends justify the means. It's almost laughable when we get suggestions about how "simple" milling a locking mechanism is :D (we thought the same thing actually). Or how "easy" it is because we are outsourcing everything (we're obviously not to the level where we can create custom NSA certified-hardware encrypted boards! (we're working on it though!). Thanks to everyone that showed us their love and support! Stay tuned! Hey Guys, Update is being uploaded - the video was apparently too large so we had to compress it to comply. @Zach We're still following guidelines set forth by Kickstarter - there is a lengthy terms of use section that might answer many of your questions. Also, anyone unable or unwilling to participate in this project due to delays was invited to ask for a full refund before the April 5th deadline. We do apologize for the delays however we are working diligently to complete this project. The official update should be going out in the next hour or so with additional details. Thanks everyone! Hey guys, The update will be going up today hopefully sooner than later :) Thanks for the patience and we hope you enjoy. Have a great night! Hey guys, Just so as not to keep everyone hanging, we've pushed the update till Monday 8PM EST as we were not able to generate the final ETA this evening. @Larry You should start a pool :D We hope you all enjoy your weekend and look forward to updating everyone. @Merlin Thank you for the kind words, always a pleasure to hear from you. @Chris N. You guys HAVE seriously "kickstarted" a serious business (and one we had no idea would happen!). We have official V.C's, international orders, talks of CEO's etc. It's exciting yet daunting at the same time. So many people to please, so many expectations. We're doing our best and we hope at the end everyone will be proud of what we were able to accomplish in so little time. After all; you guys are the real reason we're here (here as in at work 18 hrs a day :D, not on the beach lol) - Have a great one guys! The thing... #Corrections Hey guys. Firstly, thank you for all the suggestions and feedback. On that note, there's no need to argue amongst yourselves. We made some serious tactical mistakes with our time estimates and ran into issues we really had no idea were even possible. We're just extremely thankful that we've had so much support (even from "negative" posts) but... we've all learned so much. @Chris That's a wonderful idea and we were planning on doing it from the start (there has been talks of life-long discounts on any future products as well). @Zach Our lack of proper planning and poor updating skills are to blame for the pessimism. We've been made quite aware of our shortcomings and are constantly reminded. The think with the larger orders meant we had to get some serious experts involved whom are accustomed to handling the logistics of such an operation. We have great people involved and our backers always shed some light on how to make things smoother. @Everyone else, thank you so much for bearing with us. We've definitely here and finishing this project is our only life's ambition (you guys have no idea). Our update will be going out this Friday and hopefully everyone will be quite relieved (we know we will!). We're trying to get someone on board to handle PR for now and in the future. Thanks again everyone, we're here and listening, trying our best to please everyone in the end. @Moritz Thankfully our encrypted USB boards are not our own design and are supplied by Kingston (based on the DTVP series boards). Our production costs haven't gone up, but the order quantities have reached 500k+. We first started this project trying to make 75 or so, that went sharply up to around 1100, THEN the absurd happened and we started getting orders from literally hundreds of interested parties. Though Kickstarter is and always will be our start, we were (and still are) literally overwhelmed and couldn't begin to fathom the intricacies of taking a product to mass-market. We have a lot to learn and new challenges and situations are a daily occurrence ;) Have faith! We literally SUCK at the updating/commenting process but we're doing the best we can (and it's obviously very VERY lacking). Our only hope is that when you guys start getting the product we'll magically be forgiven and might get some positive feedback for a change. It's hard getting nailed in public when you're working non-stop to please so many people; especially with so much at stake. Thanks for writing in though, we appreciate it either way. Hey Guys, . Been a busy last week and we're sorry we haven't been very vocal on the comments section. We are nearing the end of this project and it's crunch time. As we've stated recently, there won't be an official update till we are ready to provide a final ETA and the media we've been preparing. We do pardon the silence but there's not much time responding to random comments and we hope you guys understand we're trying to wrap everything up. @Chris It actually does take more than 4 days to get a final response. There are many variables and timelines by third part-parties are beyond our control. For those who haven't been following past posts, Bitwize is indeed a Lebanese company and they have created the website and the video renders; needless to say we're proud they were a part of this project. We understand a lot of our backers are backers of other projects and are accustomed to different approaches to conducting their projects; we're trying to refrain from posting unsubstantial official updates especially whilst nearing the end of the project. We're estimating the official update will go up Thurs but again, that may or may not happen pending a final confirmation. There have been requests for refunds during this week and we are going to have to issue such requests when the units go out to everyone else. We offered refunds for quite a while and gave updates pertaining to this issue. Those backers whom have expired their window for obtaining a refund may send an email to <email> with the subject "refund'. Such requests will be responded to after units ship out and not before. @Everyone that sent us support messages pertaining to the comments (though again, pardon for not responding! We're literally working 20 hours a day); THANK YOU! :) We understand a lot of backers have had their doubts and our lack of communication at times (most of the time!) doesn't really help but amends will be made when the update goes out and everything is in order. We're always banking on the quality of the unit and the end result opposed to comment-glory ;) (It's extremely likely that comments on the comments section will not be responded to in the next week, for urgent matters kindly send a PM or an email). Thanks again guys! Hey guys. We're finalizing our final ETA with the vendor today, pics are ready for the update and we're waiting on final word to go ahead and post. @Larry No schedules for this update, it's the one before product launch and we really want to make sure the final ETA is included. Last hurdle to get out of the way and we're all set. We'll follow up on this in a few hours after speaking with GPI. Thanks guy! Hey guys: We're scheduled for a major update within the next 3-4 days. We'll be posting a lot of material and some dates based on our current timelines. Try not to post above this post till then to allow everyone to get a chance to see this. Till then guys! Have a greet weekend. @Harry, @Darien: Quite a few former backers have had similar issues and have posted here after a time verifying being taken care of. We'll look into it as we did the others however we don't have much to do with this process and we will address this issue with you personally via email/PM. Thanks for your understanding. @Andy, Should have an update for everyone Friday-Sun. Thanks for bearing with us! @Sam Np.... @Moritz Hold on there bud! We're nearing the end ;) @Sam 6xxx series aluminum as originally planned ;) Can't wait to show you guys these boards :D Make Larry happy that's for sure! @JuTs Thank you for the update :) We have received your email, PM, and now, your update. Kindly bear with them just a little bit longer, we're quite confident you will be receiving correspondence from Amazon stat. Thanks again! Ahhhhhh.... The never-ending saga that is Amazon. We have word from both former backers that the process was complete. We'd suspect that you should be taken care of shortly. Do let us know via message how that works out. Thanks @JuTs @Larry, noted :) We'll try a bit harder these next few weeks. Hopefully things will be much smoother this coming Friday. Thanks again! You're very mistaken actually. We care very much what you think to be honest. It's a real eye-opener sometimes. You guys (basing this on a hunch at this point) just don't get how much effort goes into these projects lol. SO HARD! Getting the funding is just the tip. We have to be extremely diligent about the products, the OEM's, the parts, how the lock is fitting, how the slides work, how the rings click, how the finishes feel, the packaging, the assembly, shipping. It's fairly complex and we're "retentive" to put it nicely. Most of our days are on the phone, driving from location to location, double checking with vendors, talking to the thousands of potential "resellers" that send us correspondence, etc. It's no excuse for not being more vocal on the comments section but, we try to be as straightforward as possible in a business that's apparently (and unbeknownst to us initially)... not. So in sum, do send us suggestions, grill us when you can, ask questions and let us know your thoughts, but a quirt email or PM goes much further at the end of the day :) We're working for the benefit of everyone involved, for ourselves a chance to prove we could beat the odds and have a small startup take a product to market, for kickstarter backers to receive an awesome product, and to ourselves for seeing the fruition of an idea :) By all means @larry, we love your suggestions and we mean it from the bottom of our hearts. Thank you larry for your words of wisdom :) You have voiced similar opinions on those issues several times in the past and again, we appreciate your concerns. We're glad we somehow turned you on to the Kickstarter platform, it's a wonderful tool. Our Bitwize affiliates are indeed in Lebanon and we are very proud to have them on our team. They do great design work (web work, concept art). As for the rest, we are working diligently to complete this project. There's a lot to cover and we're doing the best we can to speed things up. Will post more on Friday. Thanks again ;) Hey guys! We're here, we're listening ;) (with emoticons!). We'll have our scheduled update this Friday with the boards and other details. We're cramming right now getting everything put together and we're towards the end of the process. Thanks for your patience. @Alicia @Henry No problem :) Got your info and will look into it asap. Thanks for bearing with us. @Henry That's ok :) Could you try sending your details via Kickstarter PM? @Sam Think he's referring to the serials on the Golden Sample :) The hardware encryption engine is featured on the DataTraveler Vault Privacy edition (Kingston) with a controller by Phison. @Chris That sounds extremely reasonable. Great suggestion! That's a lot more doable and we'll make sure to let backers know to check the comments section every few days in our next official update. ;) @Chris Very true. We will remain vigilant about updating on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. This however may take the form of a smaller update on the comments section (where most of our backers seem to be more engaged) in the event we deem the update unnecessary on the "updates" section. We'll check questions, answering messages/emails as per usual :) There are several avenues for sending out info and engaging our backers and we will use them all appropriately. We messed up royally on the "scheduled" updates. So we'll try to be more vigilant with our timing (only wish you guys could know how retentive some people can be when relying on key information we need for an update!!). We're wrapping a lot of issues up atm and hopefully this won't be an issue for long :) Next 2 updates are pretty much summary updates so let us continue working on getting those ready for everyone! Thanks Chris! @Larry No problem :) Updates will be sent as frequently as possible. Material for said updates are important aspects of this project and represent extensive time and resources. We understand and wholeheartedly agree to providing timely updates when they become available and are deemed important milestones. As a "backer", we appreciate your voice and respect your valuable contribution. We WISH we could be at the screen :D but unfortunately, this project takes up a lot of time and we'd much rather get things done properly so do pardon slight delays in responding to comments. Drop us an email when you think we need a sit-down (we read them and listen very well). Keep it up, you're one of the more seriously attuned backers and we love hearing your opinion! Many thanks in advance! Hey guys. "Woah". @Larry, we'll update everyone as to that information precisely when we can. We can't compare our product or our campaign to other Kickstarter campaigns. Every company has it's own way of doing things and different obstacles to overcome. We understand that our "people skills" aren't that great (we're trying though!) however we can't be glued to the comments sections 24/7 when we're trying to wrap things up. Also, posting 4-5 times consecutively isn't the best way to get a point across. A simple email will suffice. We do appreciate all the advice that comes our way but we will be updating and providing material based on how we see fit. @Sam @Chris: We will announce ETA's when that is possible to announce. We have a unique product that requires much more mechanical accuracy than most other products and we won't rush the manufacturers. @Tim, thank you for the kind words :) Cheer up guys, we're working as fast as we can. @Zach The keyring feature will be part of the total package and will not cost anything additional. The pouch however will be an accessory. Also, we'll try to get the packaging samples up. They're pretty cool and were worked on by a German packaging company. Keep the questions coming guys! but do keep in mind we're not sitting idly by the screen, we love offering all the info we have on hand but we won't post info just for the sake of it. Thanks again! @Yuhann, Thank you for your diligence. We apologize frequently for our delays and appreciate our backers for being patient and keeping us on track ;) Too bad we're going to lose you as a backer, you have interesting opinions. Thanks again! @Sam Yeah it was kind of odd, we hadn't noticed it till you brought it up actually. They do however do certain stress tests, we doubt it's anything serious. The Golden Sample is provided to show the GUI interface, it's quite meaningless other than that. The 1260 Kickstarter boards are all in pristine condition so we're happy with that :) @Larry Funny you should mention, Sam had the same question from one of his bloggers on his site. We forwarded the question on to Kingston for a potential explanation. We're not exactly sure what kind of marks they are but the rest don't have them so they obviously did some sort of testing on the Golden Sample before shipping it out. As for your other question: we're greatly enjoying the opportunity to work on this project using your collective pledges (and a lot of our own too!) - so yes! :) We won't be posting another large update till we are ready to upload the videos and give a final ETA. We should also have the final version of the Key-ring/pouch right about next update time so hopefully those will go up as well. Hang in there guys, we're at the home stretch and it's crunch time! @Yuhann That process was addressed "several" times; you've had direct contact with us over email and PM several times as well. This issue will not be addressed over comments as we have stated multiple times; is not the correct venue. Out of curiosity, have you checked your junk-mail for @amazon.com correspondence? It's a simple issue that has come up with several former backers? Do kindly let us know in PM/email as you have before. Thank you for your understanding. @Sam Is it the color scheme? @Chris, DEFINITELY got it :) We are however interested in multiple opinions before we offer any new choices to everyone. Aside from the aforementioned, anything else you think could be improved upon? @Yuhann We get messages and they are processed just as they are with every other backer. AGAIN: We don't control some systems. Commenting on a social platform as to issues that do not pertain to the subject matter of that forum/platform result in flagged spam, a waste of your own personal time, and the same answer with respect to the questions at hand: a little patience goes a long way :) Will "re"look into it np. Thanks for your understanding. . @Larry,Sam: Thought we decided on Fridays? :D We'll post as soon as we have anything additional though no worries. @Larry: Still waiting for your response after "taking it all in". Where's our feedback guys?! @Chris&Larry LOL! The funny thing about that entire thread was that roughly 12 people get push notifications to phone/computer/tablets every time a comment is posted haha! :P Update is up and thanks guys for keeping the mood light! It gets really stressful and well, we appreciate it and appreciate all your tips. Tell us what you think of the interface! @Sam No apologies needed :) We're all on the same team here and we're all doing our part (even our backers!) to keep the momentum going. Hey guys, long day (still not over). Update will go through tonight as planned. Everyone was o.o.o and we apologize no one could immediately respond to backer comments. Golden Sample/Gui pics will be posted in a few hours. @Zach Port City Group is a manufacturing group that works mainly with Ford/Chrysler-types (not a real port lol); they are currently responsible for milling duties. On that note, 77k worth of boards would never be shipped via ship and require special precautions as to storage (correlated directly to the extreme value). @Larry On the way! @Sam We agree too, but we really are actually working almost round the clock; big responsibility and a lot of logistics work. Coming right up! @Sam No worries. Unfortunately we didn't get a call back this evening. We'll have those GUI/Sample pics up within the next 24 hours (will go through as a direct email so no need to check back) :) Thanks for the suggestions! Thanks :) Hope is one of those things we've learned (no thanks to Kickstarter) not to rely on too much! We hope we get all the info we need! Will let everyone know in a bit. Hey guys! We're waiting on a few details from Port City Group on the ETA's. Hopefully we should get a final invoice from them and an ETA (we were hoping that would have been done by tonight). In the event it goes through, we will be posting the update as scheduled, if not, we think we might delay that update till tomorrow. Will keep everyone posted on the comments section either way! (Thanks CB for giving us a reminder!) @Chris That's all thanks to you guys for keeping everything in check :) Thanks for everything guys! @Sam Unboxing :) Hey guys! . We will be postponing the general update until Tuesday (8pm EST). Boards are in transit and will be going through customs Monday morning. (VERY EXCITING!!). It's been a long time coming and we know everyone is anxious! Do stay tuned these next few days as quite a few details will emerge as to the units. As always, feel free to drop us a line with your questions/comments anytime. Have a great weekend everyone! @Chris Thanks! It's not as dramatic as it sounds lol but updates are updates :) @Chris Definitely not just you! We didn't want to send 2 updates a day after the other, the Golden Sample + GUI shots will be going out with the general update around 8pm EST. Sorry about the confusion but it's really hectic around here right now. Stay tuned! (Send us a message and tell us to get a move on tomorrow!) :) @Juts Yes we have thank you for double checking. ;) @Sam No worries :) All in a day's work! @Chris, we are located in Michigan (U.S) so that would be 8:00pm EST (GMT -5) ;) Till then! @Josh not a problem and thank you for your support! It helps us get things done more efficiently when we have the right info ;) Take care and many thanks! @JuTs (Note: You gave us the wrong email as it was not the email on the initial transaction. Kindly check the receipt on the email you sent and verify the transaction went through). Thanks again. @JuTs No need to be angry, direct transfers should go through in a few hours. Though again, we wont be communicating on the matter via comments as we've posted several times. Do kindly let us know as to the status once Amazon has sent you a confirmation. Thanks again! @Sam We''ll be posting the pics for the Golden Sample and a small walkthrough of the new GUI today. The unboxing of the boards SHOULD be posted Friday. In the event we are not able to have that up, we will be posting a general update on Friday regardless as there are a few things of note. Sorry for not posting so quickly! We're so swamped right now but we're on it! :) @Larry On it. We have 70k worth of PCBA that's being tested. Needless to say no one is idle ATM though it's 3AM. @Chris we agree too :) though we thought we'd listen to Chris and do updates every Friday like he suggested since he obviously knew what he was talking about. Gives us time to do our jobs as well as the opportunity to give a meaningful post on a weekly basis. BRB! @Josh Thanks :) Really appreciate it, and again, pardon the delay while we sorted things out for you. @Sam The Golden Sample was perfect! Dimensions were just perfect, functionality par-none and the GUI is beautiful. Those screenshots will be posted ASAP! Thanks guys! @Josh That should be taken care of within the next 36 hours. If you could drop us a line when it goes through we'd appreciate it! @Larry Lol! When we get essential parts like this, we typically run it through the entire unit to make ABSOLUTELY SURE that its 110% perfect. Which means, for the past weekend, not a wink! This is after-all a very VERY precise lock. Your comment was meant to be constructive so there's definitely no need to verify anything :) We know you mean well from the amazing email you sent with all the suggestions. We'll post media the minute we're done running the unit through properly. Small Update . The PCBA Golden Sample was received at our offices from our PCBA vendor yesterday! Wohoo! We've been running it through inspection most of the night and everything looks just perfect. We'll be posting some screen shots of the GUI and the Login Process in a little bit. Looks better than before! We'll let everyone know whats going on shortly. . @Sam Will forward your request on, no worries. @Everyone thanks for the support! We got a ton of emails this last week from various backers expressing their support and continued dedication to this project and we REALLY REALLY appreciate it! Thanks again! We're pretty happy with our PCBA vendors :) They make the best PCBA hardware the world-over. It's also the largest investment in the project too! We're fairly anxious at their arrival but we have a confirmation for "end of April", they're usually fairly punctual! We'll take a few pics and a short video of the unboxing :D @Sam We should have the boards April 30th as per our understanding. We have not yet received the Golden Sample yet, we might be getting it today/tomorrow :D Keep your fingers crossed! @Martin Someone hasn't been getting updates! :D We're doing our best to have the units sent out according to the new strategy. We're posting updates rather frequently and you're always welcome to drop us a line for additional information. Thanks! Trust us when we say this: We're definitely waiting by the darn door! :D @Sam We're supposed to get the Golden Sample with the new GUI's any minute now! Main boards will be arrive on the 30th. We'll do a little unboxing for everyone :D @Juts We have updated the few backers that have had difficulty with their refunds quite frequently. Those refunds that for some reason had problems were issued cash transfers via Amazon (not refunds on existing transactions, but direct transfers), those were initiated yesterday. You should be getting a confirmation in the next 48 hours or so. We don't make the rules on these things but we understand the frustration. We obviously get your emails as we corresponded with you directly, if you have additional questions kindly drop us a line :) Thanks in advance. @Chris: Sounds like a plan! Hopefully though, we won't need to keep that up for too long. We're almost towards the end of the project! @Larry, Chris: You guys make very valid points that we have taken to heart. Having scheduled updates makes a lot of sense now that we think about it. Friday 8pm EST sounds like a fairly good time for that. @Larry: We try SO hard to keep up with everyone. Our updates are usually self explanatory when it comes to what we're up to and where we stand. We do however acknowledge a huge "void" if you will when it comes to communication. We're trying a lot harder to make customer support and updating a higher priority. We give lengthy explanations to backers requesting refunds a little more verbosity on the simple fact that, 6 backers as of right now are making up 90% or so of our correspondence. It's very taxing at times and distracting from our time that would otherwise be spent working for the majority :s We'll try to pick up the slack when it comes to speedier updates, if you have a few pointers (as you seem to know what you're talking about), perhaps you wouldn't mind dropping us a few pointers via msg? We'd really appreciate it! @Chris, Thank you for the kind words! @Everyone We're waiting for our PCBA Golden Sample to arrive via FedEx and it should be here any time now. Manufacturing quotes for the re-milling are being generated and we will definitely let everyone know whats going on the moment we have word. Thanks for your support guys! . IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR THE FEW BACKERS THAT HAVE YET TO RECEIVE REFUNDS As it seems you guys have had some apparent difficulty with Amazon, we will be refunding you via DIRECT TRANSFERS to your Amazon accounts. This is not a refund of a previous transaction but a credit to your accounts. This will be conducted tonight through tomorrow. We have had to wait for your discrepancies with Amazon to be voided in order not to be charged twice (once for a regular refund, once for sending you a direct payment). We understand this has been frustrating however we had no control over the process. Please stay tuned. Please note: We do NOT use Paypal and all credits will be issued to the emails associated with the original Amazon transactions we have on record. If you wish for this to be changed (your email/Amazon Account), drop us a line with your new details and kindly request it in writing to <email> . Thanks again everyone!! Definitely not the right venue lol. @Josh you might want to check your junkmail :) Regardless, the few backers that have had issues with their refunds will be getting direct transfers to their desired Amazon accounts today through Monday. (No, we don't have a corporate PayPal account). @Everyone, we got the PCBA Golden Sample today!! We should have screen shots and GUI shots pretty soon! We'll be getting the rest of the 1100 some odd boards later this week (end of April!). Hey guys! Not radio silence at all, just really really busy trying to orchestrate everything so that nothing is missed! Detail is everything and we want our first unit to be absolutely perfect! @Sam, noted. Expect an email in the next few days. @Anyone who has had problems with Amazon: We will be sending out direct wire transfers from our Amazon accounts to yours as this has seriously taken long enough. Emails will be sent out today/tomorrow requesting which emails you would like us to send funds to. Thanks everyone for tuning in, we'll try to keep everyone update properly once we have "concrete" dates :) @Larry A few team members sniffled at that :D Thanks for your support. @Noam do you have any idea how ridiculous it sounds that you filed a refund request from Amazon directly, along with roughly a dozen other backers, (whom have all been serviced by Amazon directly) - whom later requested we post comments on their behalf (see the comments thread below) - and after continuous messages and posts requesting the 4-5 odd backers that seemed to have done something wrong; kindly take their personal financial issues to a proper venue (i.e messaging) - you still don't seem to understand that requests sent to Amazon are handled by Amazon? We understand that Kickstarter/Amazon payments is an odd payment method; but we can't stress this enough: WE CANT DIRECTLY CONTROL HOW REFUNDS ARE ISSUED. You request them with Amazon, we get a notification - That's about it. This will literally be the last public post on this issue - Backers requiring additional attention to their personal finances kindly take it to direct messages (as the dozen or so have done so previously without any problems). @JuTs That's truly odd! We get mails and messages from hundreds of backers without issue. We'll send you a personal msg here on Kickstarter see if that goes through. @Brent No need to worry. As with the other backers, your request is being processed accordingly. We do apologize for the time however, again, this is not something we ourselves control. Kindly do let us know if and when Amazon sends you your confirmation as other backers have done. Hey guys! Lets not get too carried away (looking at you Larry haha :D) Hope you guys had a great weekend. We're waiting on a final ETA quote from our milling partners today, hopefully we can post to everyone which alloy series we went with and if or if not the Micro-Arc Oxidation is going to be possible. Hang in there guys, we're finalizing the little details and we should be done with this phase this week. @Larry: think you can do one without the scary backdrop? :D Hey guys, we are posting the following on behalf of two of our previous backers: . Sasha says: . Hi, Since I am no longer a backer on this project, I was hoping you could post this in the comments section for the project: . "I submitted my request for refund with Amazon through the disputes method on 3/30. It was approved on 4/2 and the refund posted to my credit card several days later, with a posting date of 4/3. To everyone expecting a refund: you should get it, it took an additional few days for my credit card to post the refund and they post-dated it. . To Cryptrade and everyone sticking it out: Good luck with the continuation of the project and I hope these units reach their deposition phase change and ship soon!" . Thanks, -Sasha . Also the following: . dim3m says: . Hi Cryptrade, Please share this to others regarding refunds. I request/ my dispute with amazon on the refund. I got the confirmation email on the next day. And within 5 days, the amount i pledged ($200) has returned to my bank account. I am no longer a backer but still believe Cryptrade are hard working people and are trying hard to make things right. I suggest to those who are trying to request refunds is to go through Amazon first then just private email Cryptrade. . dim3m . Hope that helps guys :) Thanks everyone for the kind words. Enjoy your weekends! Guys seriously, if you have any concerns of a personal nature, kindly send an email or a message. We've processed dozens of requests and there haven't been any issues when directions are followed. This board is seriously not the place to be discussing personal private financial information. It has been covered in several posts, several updates, and discussed at length in comments. When you request a refund from Amazon directly, they send us a message of the request and they process them. We really have no say how they do it or how long it takes them. Hope that helps. @Noam. Again, as with everyone that had requested a refund, the processing was done. We have received the notification from Amazon that you asked them for a refund (again, you asked AMAZON for a refund). We're fairly certain they will get back to you when the issue is resolved and notify you as to that transaction. We have just received yet another message from you, and as before, we will forward it on to Amazon payments. Thank you. @Ben I think we've said this several times in comments, updates, etc. "All refund requests were processed" You should be getting an email from Amazon and that if you require any further information, kindly send us an email at <email> or a personal message as this is definitely not the right place to be discussing personal financial matters. @Everyone have a great Easter weekend! Hey guys! just wanted to wish everyone a happy Easter weekend! :) This is going to be a busy upcoming week! Anyone that is still having any trouble with Amazon kindly drop us a line. Have a great one ;) Thanks Sam :) Thank you all actually! Lets show the world what Kickstarter is all about. Funding is great, but between us, our partners, and our backers, we truly have a unique source of ingenuity, expertise, and passion that could take this from just an interesting concept to something far beyond initial expectations. Any backers wishing to shed some insight or lending a hand is absolutely more than welcome to. @Marty Thank you for that :) We've refrained from quoting Kickstarter TOS for a while. We've always felt we were well within our working guidelines but alas, we understand the frustration. With respect to help: We're currently getting ETA quotes from one of our CNC vendors. We're discussing material options (various alloys), mainly 6000 series aluminum with slightly higher magnesium concentrations. A backer suggested that for time, we might engage another potential vendor to crank out some of the units to divide workloads (this we liked). Anyone into manufacturing have a reputable source? We look for extremely well equipped vendors with an outstanding client-base. Anyone think they might have someone please do share :) Also, if we have any material engineers on board: we're looking into Micro-Arc Oxidation for the black units. Any thoughts? Hey guys, we can understand the sense of urgency to get this project wrapped up but please try not to direct comments or issues with one-another. We're all a part of this project and we all hope for the best. Though we really do appreciate backers that have taken a personal interest in the project as well as backers taking their time to voice their opinions, lets keep it constructive ;) Everyone is entitled to their opinion and we're proud of each and every backer. This project needs a little dose of support from everyone and your understanding & patience will do way more to allow us to complete this project as it truly deserves. Thanks all @Anyone that has requested a refund: Refund requests were processed. In the even they were sent to Amazon, they were definitely processed. Kindly give them the required time to process the transaction. We don't pretend to know why they require this amount of time however, we do know that it goes through :) #Correction (From David Kickbusch) :D Hey guys, a forward from one of our former backers: . My refund from Amazon Payments has been credited to my account. It took approximately 5 days after I received notification from Amazon via the dispute process. Hang in there, it will come through. I'm sure Cryptrade will make good on their promise. . Thanks everyone for your continued patience. Again, if anyone has any questions or concerns with respect to their accounts, questions, or just generally want to have a chat, drop us a line :) @JuTe If it was sent to Amazon, then its 100% received. We gave Amazon directions to process any request sent their way. Apparently though they take their time but if anyone feels they need a confirmation, kindly drop us a line. @David, all refund requests were processed.. the majority of the refunds went out on Monday, there are a few more however this process occurs with Amazon and not with us. They tend to take 3-10 business days to process a request. Getting our attention via msg regarding personal financial matters is the correct way to go about doing that. We have submitted your request and we're fairly certain Amazon will get back to you when it has been processed as they have with the other backers. @Mark We don't have delays processing refunds, it's a matter of forwarding the request to Amazon, we sent you a wire basically and not a voided transaction (hence the reason you can still comment). Backers requesting refunds are kindly asked to address their comments and concerns via email or personal msg. Every request that has been sent has been processed, in the event additional information was required, we have contacted those specific backers to provide additional information. :) Hope that helps. Uh oh! Just a friendly reminder to everyone: Your feedback, time, support, (collective opinions); make Kickstarter a great platform for development, research, polling, etc. *kindly* keep it clean guys :) We're all in this together and constructive opinions will always be the best way to move forward with everything. Hey guys! Material selection is being HOTLY debated right now with our engineering teams. We've also been in talks with KY Manufacturing in MI. We're negotiating the final details at this very moment and hopefully be updating everyone as soon as they give us the green-light. Not a problem :) We do have a request in your name and it was submitted to Amazon. You should be getting an email from them in the next few days. Thanks for your patience :) @Josh Most of the backers requesting an refund have received an email from Amazon. We were told that this process takes anywhere from 3-10 Business days. Kindly drop us a line via message or email at <email> as the comments section is not the best way to get our attention on personal financial issues ;) @Mark Funny you should mention that! The original designer of the CRXi Vault has been 'tinkering' around with a new project :) You guys will obviously be the first to know if we put anything out there! Thanks again for your kind words, we can honestly say that this process has been an EXTREMELY unique learning experience and we're glad for the opportunity. Hey guys, we got a private message from David Kickbusch requesting we post this on his behalf as he cannot post on the comments section anymore: . "I received notification from amazon payments today of a refund. An actual transaction has not appeared in my bank as of yet. I believe that will follow shortly. I wish Cryptrade and the USB the best of luck. The best AES USB drive EVAH!!" . Thank you Mr. Cryptrade. . You're most welcome David :) It's the thought that counts and your support meant a lot to us! @Mark Less a reboot than some serious and important decision making. We don't like to lose backers under any circumstances however we have an obligation to the majority and they have been quite supportive and highly understanding by way of lending their time, suggestions, and even expertise in some instances :) We've got a solid product, excellent partners, great vendors, and an amazing backer pool. Re-milling will commence this week, the new boards are en-route and we're more dedicated than ever to get this product launched. We're very optimistic and we really look forward to the next few weeks. Thanks for the kind words! @David Most project are re-done due to unsuccessfully achieving their funding goals. We have a lot of support and we have an awesome backer pool and are actively helping us develop this project and we are confident with the end result. Though the delays are inconvenient and sometimes frustrating, we are keeping in with the Kickstarter spirit and we're proud of what we have all achieved. There is a lot of behind-the-scenes work involved in launching a product and you don't just give in when times get rough. You stick around, work things out, remain dedicated, and above all, work REALLY hard! :) We value our backers and we want them to get the best units possible. If this means having to deal with a few sleepless nights, branching out our vendor network or seeking our backers assistance, we're all for it and will remain dedicated to each and every one. Hope that helps ;) @Mark A lot of backers have different names on their Amazon/Kickstarter accounts. The only secure way to do it was through Amazon. This issue has been taken care of. You were not the only person to receive a refund directly. Of the 20 some odd refund requests, roughly half were processed via direct transfer. The remaining backers (having sent messages via Amazon as opposed to disputing the transaction) are being processed by Amazon. 5 backers sent us requests via Kickstarter and we have since requested they provide their proper details so that we may get on with this process. If anyone needs to address a specific concern with respect to their accounts, kindly drop us a message or email. Thanks again :) @David Refunds via Amazon have been processed :) You guys should be getting messages by Amazon in the next few days. As for the 5 backers that requested refunds but didn't provide any information, we have requested that they provide their transaction ID's (mainly because we can't view email information from kickstarter and some backers have different kickstarter aliases than what they have on their Amazon accounts). Regardless, all requests have been properly initiated. Hey guys, just a mini update on a few issues. We've found what we think is the fastest route to re-milling as well as a material solution that we think is going to make everyone really excited. With respect to the backers that have requested refunds, we have confirmation from Amazon that they should be completed within the next 3 working days. We should have a full official update out tomorrow. Have a great weekend everyone! @David No problem :) It's being formulated in chart form. We mainly went by 2 factors: Actual votes and then opinions and concerns (pros and cons). We're going to go with a solution to address both situations. Not 100% confirmed but we're thinking of going with a non 6000 series aluminum alloy (more a novelty alloy) that will give us the finishes we want, the speed we need, and the close tolerances that we require. We're also creating a web-form for backers that want to verify their refunds (a lot of backers asked for a refund then backed out). The few backers that have requested refunds from Amazon we handled directly with Amazon. That has been taken care of earlier this morning. Backers that "requested" a refund by sending us a message from Amazon, have also been taken care of. Confirmation emails will be sent from Amazon directly. What remains were those backers that may have sent messages on the comments section or via Kickstarter message. They have been submitted to Amazon and will receive emails accordingly directly from Amazon. Hey guys. To answer a few questions: With respect to refunds: A back-and-forth went through between ourselves, Kickstarter, and Amazon. Amazon has found a simply solution to speed this up and you guys can either send us a message, an email, send Amazon a message to be sent to us, or dispute the transaction. All refund requests in the past are being processed and you should get an email from Amazon within the next 3 business days. With respect to the CNC milling/new material debate: Backers have voiced their opinions and we think we've found an extremely interesting solution. We are speaking with the engineers at J Marc to see if we can use this method. It will cover all the main issues being covered, namely: finishes, heft, tight tolerances, durability, and more importantly, speed. An update with the official response will be posted and we want everyone comfortable with the solution. Thanks for your patience. Backers that have asked for a refund have been taken care of and will be notified shortly. @Sasha We're game for making the best unit possible :) Do you know of any great satin finishes for stainless? We know it can be treated for fingerprints (like on many stainless refrigerators) and it does offer some really great tensile strength, any thoughts? @David We don't control how a transaction is refunded. In most cases we get a message from Amazon stating a backer asked for a refund. That's usually how it goes. As Kickstarter and Amazon have some private agreement, we see the transactions yet we can't intervene (usually there's a "refund" action next to each item if you are an Amazon vendor). In this case we can openly say the Kickstarter platform leaves project curators with a minimal set of tools to deal with these types of situations. Though we can say however, that refunds are processed and Amazon is usually really good at customer service. In any event, backers that choose not to remain backers should take their concerns to a proper venue such as a direct message or email as the comments section is not the appropriate place to discuss these issues. As for the voting, it's not just about who wants what; lot of backers don't really know which is the best material or have no specific preference. Others are adamant about a specific look or feel. Our job is to create the best solution for everyone involved. Going through all the messages, feedback, and comments, it's fairly clear there are advantages and disadvantages to either process. We could just as easily CNC mill aluminum rings with stainless steel or magnesium alloy inner components for strength. We could use Grivory as a base and carbon fiber rings. What we find right now is that backers were drawn to the initial apple-esque look of anodized aluminum yet the softness of the material is somewhat to be debated. One very interesting suggestion was to use micro-arc oxidation for the black models (we loved that suggestion). In the event we are going to go the CNC route again, we might want to take a look at some newer finishes available recently. We feel strongly that this turning point in this project will eventually lead to a much more refined product and we encourage any backer with any suggestions to voice their opinions. Positive and constructive comments will get units in the hands of everyone much faster and we're here to make sure that this project is the best it can be. You guys make some really valid points and we're tallying up the general consensus here. We've had a few "REALLY" helpful backers make some very interesting suggestions. The main dilemma of re-milling is the time problem. Some backers are willing to wait others are simply exhausted with waiting. Though both techniques have their advantages, we're looking out for the interest of the majority. Though we haven't announced this publicly just yet, backers have chosen and we will cater to their wishes at all costs. We always treat the Kickstarter units separate from any commercial unit we might potentially released in the future. A backer has suggested that milling the units with different companies might drastically speed up this process. Other backers have suggested that Grivory is a far superior material for this type of work (and MUCH more expensive contrary to what some backers might be thinking). CNC milling requires minimal tooling (though in all fairness, its not a simple process either), whilst injection molding requires CNC milled "tools" that are extremely expensive to produce. Our main priority is getting the best unit out possible. It has to function flawlessly, looks incredibly sharp, and present a level of craftsmanship that cannot currently be bought. Though the loss of any backer regardless of what they pledged deeply saddens us, we started the project on Kickstarter to get feedback on a model that we otherwise would have had to mass-produce. We will continue to offer all of our backers our undivided attention. Some decisions we make along the way may be wholly different from what our backers expect and at the end of the day, we're here to get a job done and make everyone happy. We will definitely be involving you guys a lot more in the next few days with key decisions and we're confident now more than ever that there is indeed a huge amount of support for this project. Where we fall short we're fairly certain our (thankfully!) large backer pool will let us know and pitch in when necessary. We'd like to thank the countless backers that sent us emails with suggestions/tips and we hope you guys keep the spirit up. For backers that we have disappointed, our deepest and sincerest apologies. We will allow this voting process to continue for a few more hours before we reach a final decision. We will be requesting a few more polls from our backers this weekend and we hope you guys stay tuned; your feedback is most important. Thanks again everyone! Hey guys, Just to clarify, you can always send us a message or email. You can also do it via your own Amazon accounts. We've had backers on Dec 25th do it that way and they go through without a hitch. We can issue refunds too (namely, we do a transfer from our Amazon account to yours). The only problem with that is that your registered Kickstarter emails are not always the same emails used for the Amazon accounts and then we'd have to request that the backer ask for a refund directly from Amazon. In any event, we get notifications either way and they are processed accordingly. The deal with Amazon and Kickstarter slightly complicates the normal vendor refund situation (namely, we don't have a refund button like a normal vendor would). You're welcome to go through us via personal msg on Kickstarter, email, or Amazon directly. Regardless, they are processed accordingly. Hey guys. We contacted Amazon on behalf of the few backers that wished to ask for a refund. From what we understand with the Amazon agreement with Kickstarter that "refunds" are not issued as they normally would if for example, the unit was being sold on Amazon.com. What instead should be done form your Amazon account is a "dispute" of non receipt of goods. As for Jim/Davids comments, Bitwize is a design firm and partners for Cryptrade Inc. As are Slingshot Product Development Group, S&B Assets and Safford & Baker PLLC. We also deal with J Marc Engineering as well as GPI Prototyping. Our PCBA board suppliers are Kingston with encryption controllers by Phison. We're tallying up how many backers are pro the new material and those who are not. A final decision on the matter will most likely be reached in the next 24 hours or so. Thanks for your feedback guys! Hey guys. After all the "grab ye torches and pitchforks" we've been putting together an update answering most of the questions being voiced. Stay tuned and thank you all for your feedback. @David Backers that have received refunds will still be registered as backers on the project. We have contacted Kickstarter and they have explained that a backer cannot be removed regardless of any change in backer status. @Mark We have sent in our previous updates as to the procedures for requesting a refund (i.e send us a message here or via <email>). A refund was issued and Amazon has sent the appropriate transaction ID associated with the transaction. We would recommend that any other backer that needs to discuss their personal financial information via private message or email as the comments section is not the proper venue. @Mark Your refund was processed. We don't control that Amazon does (you may also simply ask for a refund via your Amazon account if the time-frame is the issue). And the idea of not finishing the project and collecting on funds is just plain silly. As interesting as it is to stipulate, fraud is not even remotely a possible. Backers wishing to refute a purchase with Amazon may do so and there are no timelines for such a dispute. Credit card companies also do the same thing. We're held liable for every dollar amount sent our way by Amazon (not to mention the IRS). We understand it's frustrating however any backer wishing to discontinue support may do so at anytime. As for making a CRXi Vault unit via standard prototyping, you have our blessings ;) CAD drawings may be provided upon a formal request and signing of an NDA and letter of intent. Though from our own experience, it would run around 6500-8500 depending on the finish you would use. We would also suggest GPI prototyping based in Chicago (they do some great work) but be wary, professional prototyping companies tend to consider their work proprietary and will not offer photographs of the manufacturing process. We understand there's general frustration with the delay and we recommend anyone that feels unable to continue to wait patiently to either contact us with their Amazon transaction ID's where we will submit to Amazon a refund or they may do so directly from their own accounts if they would like to submit a dispute directly to Amazon. Other than that, we're working on getting everything completed in the fastest amount of time possible. @Jim - FYI, only backers are allowed to comment on a project comments section. :) @Brent Thank you sir :) Your continued confidence and kind words are very motivating to say the least. One thing many of our international backers don't seem to realize is that as an American company having received funds via Amazon/Kickstarter (both American), have responsibilities and legal obligations to complete this project (this is actually one of the main reasons that Kickstarter is currently only available to American companies/individuals). Why? Simply put, our Amazon accounts are tied to bank accounts, Social Security numbers, and personal credit. Now one one had we really do feel with all of our backers with respect to the delay and we'd love nothing more than to "quite the storm" (we mean that quite literally) with a few pictures here and there, however there are many other considerations to keep into account. We cannot simply take 989 backers' funds and not follow through, that's simply not possible as we are held personally responsible and accountable for the entire project. Keeping the moral side of the equation on the side, it's simply professional suicide for an amount of funds hardly worth potential litigation/ incarceration :) We know some of our backers are feeling a bit anxious about getting some more information (not to mention their units!) however, let's try to remain constructive throughout this process and at least logical. Though it saddens us to lose any backer whom pledged not only their funds but also their initial confidence in our project, our refund policy is sufficient enough to quell even the most doubtful. We have been delayed several times with no fault of our own other than our apparent lack of foresight and experience with the whole manufacturing process (kind of the reason we used the Kickstarter platform in the first place as it was designed for these tolerances) and we really are doing everything we can to finish what we started. We simply suggest that any backer that feels that they are unsatisfied with the delays, feel our project is fictitious, or would rather back another project, to request a refund of their initial funding. We've been in contact with several other project curators that have launched during/before our own time-frame with similar ETA's and expectations and have found that in general we are faring similarly in terms of real world results. Needless to say our unit requires a lot of attention with respect to manufacturing/engineering as we are dealing with a product aimed at security. We can't rush this guys and we have an obligation to quality that other projects simply cannot compare to. Important updates that are deemed necessary will go out in due course. Photographs and additional information will be provided when made available. We are always easily contactable and are usually really good at getting back to anyone regardless of the issue. We remind anyone that hasn't taken note of how to contact us to do so via Kickstarter messaging or at <email> for anything from a personal request, a question or concern, to catching up on some inside goodness :) Cheer up guys! You've funded quite literally the most successful USB launch in terms of sheer international exposure and we're proud of everything we've accomplished. We've had a few bumps in the road and for that we apologize sincerely. We hope you guys remain with us and your support and commitment mean more to us than you know. @Nathan When it was stated that our "programmers teams time" I was referring to my own and my partners time (which we don't get paid for) :) And our unrealistic dates were not only realistic, but tangible as we funded most of this project initially with our own capital. We really had no idea that a company from the 80's was going to claim rights to a name, although similar to our own, from an outdated HP / Cisco re-branded fax machine and would mean redoing the work we had already done. Now we don understand there is quite a bit of frustration with respect to shipping, we're continuing to do what we set out to do from day one. This may mean giving from our own time, finances, technicality, etc. A promise is a promise however we will finish what we started and make the best product we can. @Gerry Altman - THANK YOU! :) We know its extremely frustrating to fund a project and have to deal with delays and the occasional set-back and for this; your patience, kind words, support, and encouragement is MUCH appreciated! We knew from the start that tackling this type of launch was potentially very daunting however we were confident at least that we would remain steadfast and dedicated to making the best unit we possibly could. A thousand "omg - thank you'z" from the entire team! We're working round-the-clock and the encouragement is much appreciated. @Chris The password management team was done in-house and did not cost anything other than our programming teams time :) Though some people weren't aware that they were going to receive this unique reward, it is clearly spelled out under the reward "Pledge $1 or more". We are obligated to provide this reward just as we were obligated to prepare the music track and the CRXi Vault unit. As for shipping, stay tuned to our updates we'll be informing everyone as to where we stand. @Larry You make quite a few valid points however we do feel we are being truly transparent and we sure know we're working overtime to get everything done properly and up to our standards. We've also backed quite a few projects on Kickstarter. We don't however feel it necessary to update backers with half-prepared prototypes and pictures of us goofing around to keep backers engaged; we find the practice distasteful and we'd rather focus our efforts on getting everything done and making sure the units are as beautiful as they were designed. We also feel strongly that we respond to all forms of communication in a timely manner and that we post updates when necessary. Yes there have been delays, and of course we do apologize and hold ourselves accountable to providing the best units we can. We'll be posting a few updates very soon and we appreciate your patience. Our main priority is providing our backers with the most unique and well made USB device on the market and we're dead-set on doing just that. :) Thanks for your feedback, we do appreciate it and we all deeply appreciate your continued patience. @Harry Sorry about that, #CORRECTION TAA compliant not TSA compliant. As laid out by the Trade Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. & 2501-2581) (TAA) as we are manufactured and assembled in the U.S. @Sam We will be sending out an update fairly soon. @Everyone that has been using the password management system: We LOVE your comments and suggestions! Thank you for the kind reception and kinder words! Keep them coming! @David Touching base on the main points: The CRXi Vault is TSA compliant (being made and assembled in the U.S - even the PCBA boards are made State-side). We have not used our Twitter or Facebook pages as they are currently carrying the old branding. New pages will be implemented (we're basically obligated to anyways). We were never sued in the first place :) Had we taken the request to a court of law, odds were definitely in our favor however we decided to use diplomacy to resolve the issue peacefully and respectfully (which, we have done so). With respect to negative comments: We have negative comments ourselves (as we are essentially backers too!), and we respect all opinions and concerns that come our way (well, the constructive ones at least :). We're fairly well along in where we stand and we feel we are absolutely doing our best to provide an outstanding product. @Maro We hear you and we're doing the best we can to get everyone their rewards. Though the CRXi Vault is the main reward of this project, we are still obligated to provide and dedicate our resources on everything promised. It is both a legal obligation as well as a moral one. We do most certainly apologize for the delays however we are working nonstop to provide everyone with what they deserve. @Brent (again!): Thank you for that. We will make sure that the issue is resolved when viewing on iPad devices. We're glad that you picked up on the glitch! @Brent Haha@ Kickstarter default :D Our sessions currently automatically terminate on iOS devices once you leave the page. The "Keep Me Logged In" option is more browser oriented! Thanks for bringing that to our attention! @Ben @Dauzon You can actually log into the page on any iOS device and click on the little text bubble that appears to get an app-like icon straight on your device wall! It works pretty much like a full-page app and as Dauzon has replied, ful HTML5 compatibility means everything should work just fine on your iOS device. Thanks! @William Much appreciated! The User Agreement and Privacy Policy were indeed highly debated subjects and VERY important to us. We have Randy Safford to thank for the thoroughness and we're very lucky to have him and his law firm on our team! With whats going around on the internet about privacy concerns (looking at you Google!) it was a high priority to safeguard everyone's information and protect it at well above standard levels. Thank you very much for the kind words! :) @Neil We're glad you enjoyed it! We'll be constantly updating as we go along based on everyone's feedback so hopefully it will look even better! As for using different services: there are quite a few options out there for storing/saving passwords. We liked a lot of features of different websites and various apps however there were always "things" missing, and we don't like the idea of having locally saved information. We find that the service was a great starting point as there are 2 different passwords for the CRXi Vault and eventually having a well developed service for storing that information would spare the end-user the hassle of having to ship us back a unit in case they forgot their password. After it was decided to provide the service, we decided to go all-out on a complete option that could unify the encrypted password management service. With your help we are quite confident we will be able to knock out one of the best password management systems the world-over! @Dim3m Thanks for the kind words :) We're using 256-bit AES encrypted databases on a dedicated U.S server. We will update our "about" page with details as to the host and their security measures. Also, 256-bit GeoTrust certified SSL encryption is used for all data transmissions. All databases are currently fully encrypted based on the information you choose during the registration process and we do not store any information unencrypted nor do we have access to unencrypted databases. With respect to the secondary email: that is definitely something we may look into, thank you for the wonderful suggestion. @Dauzon, thank you very much! :) We're glad you like it and hope you find it useful! @Tatsu Glad we could help :) We'll be updating everyone fairly soon. Thanks again! @Sam Thank you :) We just sent out a mini-update; we'll be posting another one fairly soon. Hey guys, stay tuned for your emails in just a little bit. Keep in mind that backers wishing to change their shipping information may do so directly from their profiles! @Ahmad Thank you for the kind words and support! You made our month! We will certainly been looking into the matter after your suggestions and will find the most suitable situation for all of your backers local and international. Thanks for the comment! @Julesdenham We most certainly have addressed the issue and an email was sent to your inbox. Typical Amazon payments processing times for such requests take approximately 10-14 Business days and you will be notified via email. Also, as suggested to a previous backer with a similar request, kindly correspond to such inquiries via the Kickstarter messaging system or via <email> as the comments section is not the proper venue for discussing private financial matters. Thank you. @Yui There will be no additional costs incurred to the end receiver. All taxes/dues/fees are paid outright. @Sc2zzge We'll look into having some sort of expedited shipping service. Thanks for the suggestion. @Sam @Dauzon We'll be posting an update later today with a bit more info. Stay tuned :) @Sam All U.S & Canadian orders will be via UPS ground. International orders via UPS and DHL pending location. Tracking numbers will be provided via email the minute they are sent out from the factory via email. We should be launching the Vault password management system today as a v1.0 :) We can't wait to see the general feedback and Icon suggestions :) Hang in there guys! @chris @dim3m Almost there guys! We'll be updating everyone in the next day or so. FINALLY launching the Vault interface. SSL implementation is a go. User wishing to change addresses and the like will have the opportunity before everything gets sent out. Keep it up guys! We're so close! :) @Sam The external housing & the hardware encrypted USB boards will both be covered under warranties. That information along with information on how to recover from forgetting the external locking pass-code will be provided when the units are shipped (via the manual and via our support page). @Sam not random at all, thanks for asking. Actually yes as a matter of fact they do. A warranty covering the PCBA boards will be granted. @gdep An email has been sent confirming receipt of your ID. On that note, we're pretty good about getting messages and responding in a timely manner. We would kindly remind everyone to send us direct messages right here on Kickstarter or via email at <email>. Discussing personal financial matters on the open commenting system is definitely not the proper platform. Thanks guys. @Sam Again, we get our re-branded units the same time as everyone else. :) @Sam_k right you are, thanks for that. @Sam Sorry about that, busy busy busy! We get our re-branded units same as everyone else. We'll keep everyone posted when we have more info. Till then, look out for official updates in your inboxes. @Inillortep Kindly check your junk mail box, messages in general are typically read within minutes of receipt, responses generated accordingly. You may wish to include @crypteks.com as a rule on your junkmail filters. If that doesn't work, kindly let us know. You may also send us a direct message here on Kickstarter as is typically more appropriate when dealing with personal financial information or that you require further assistance directly from someone on the team. Hope that helps. @Sam Yeah actually they do! The rings were designed to have a slight "ticking" if you will. They also full stop at each individual letter. The build quality is impeccable. @Mathew, as with your previous updates, we're working on getting shots of a fully assembled model and perhaps a video or two on how it opens and works in general. Bear with us guys, we've hit a few roadblocks along the way but full steam ahead atm! @Mark +1. You our esteemed backer just won yourself something interesting! :D :D Notice the one minute apart on the comment! :D No worries! @David (muahah!). Full disclosures will most DEFINITELY be obligatory as well as encryption standards and storage methodology fully explained in much detail. If anyone knows anyone at GeoTrust give them a nudge! We want to log you guys in SO bad! I'll try to post a few pics on the interfaces and some more info on the encryption method used (we KNOW we won't disappoint!) @gdep Finalization and directions takes on the form of an official request by a backer as well as providing their Amazon transaction number for processing. We thank you for your initial support, it is much appreciated. Hey guys, update time! @David @Neil (part @gdep) The only reason we haven't posted actual product pictures is due to the fact that we are in a rush to get them off to you guys. Unfortunately we won't have the opportunity to have them assembled and sent to us in advance as we had done previously with the "Crypteks" branded units. We'll be posting a rather detailed step-by-step on the entire Kickstarter campaign (as well as the MANY disappointments!) in the future. We'd love to share that info with you guys and there are plans in the works to publish this information to the public to better help prepare future Kickstarter project owners. @gdep We understand that the wait is strenuous and indeed very inconvenient to a lot of our backers. We do apologize for this delay however it was not in our hands and we took a rather defensive position by re-branding to just get this rolling again. The Vault password management system will be up and running pending the SSL license issue from GeoTrust. We refuse to launch this without this secure transmission protocol. We COULD use open SSL however we find that securing the information properly is our obligation and we will not take shortcuts. The Vault password management system is merely a simple tool to store whatever passwords you'd like; it has no bearing on the CRXi Vault unit whatsoever but merely a convenient tool for all of our backers to enjoy. As for Beta Testers that were part of the core-functionality: as we selected what we thought to be the most suited to helping us with programming and encryption, NDA's were obviously signed with them preventing them speaking about how it works. Proper credits will be given in due course however confidentiality was obviously an important part of the process as some aspects of the core programming was accessible to them for testing. As for re-branding: as the artwork with the user interface (USB interface), as well as the USB outer housing/packaging/printed material/website were branded with the Crypteks name. We have since had to re manufacture those parts and change all the artwork. Boards with the new artwork have since been purchased and will appear with the new artwork (without the Crypteks - as per the agreement we had reached with the company that used the word "cryptek") With respect to the website: the entire site was implemented in HTML5 coding. We would recommend that you download the latest web browser (we use Firefox ourselves) and have not seen any issues from anyone else. If this matters persists kindly drop us an email and perhaps we could help you figure out whats going wrong. Other than that, we're getting your comments but really busy getting all of these orders ready for shipment! Thanks again everyone. @(quite a few backers! lol). "as per some serious request!" an official update has gone out ahead of schedule hopefully answering a few of your questions and addressing your concerns. Although we always welcome our backers' feedback, we will however at this time kindly request that such feedback is done so constructively. We really do apologize for the past delay however, this was above and beyond our initial control and we feel we have aptly remedied the situation as per our obligations to everyone. As we were stopped in our tracks from actually providing backers with their rewards (quite literally), we have since overcome this obstacle and until fairly recently were allowed to continue with this project with the vigor and ambition we had initially set out with. We can only assert that backer rewards will be fulfilled. Thank you. @ Tony Though we understand your frustrations, we feel our previous updates on the updates section is fairly thorough and we haven't deviated from them thus far. We do apologize that you may have grown accustomed to frequent update posting on that section however we have responded to all questions/comments/messages/emails sent our way. We are morally obligated to remain steadfast in our responsibilities and to remain transparent in our communication. We plan on sending out an update on the updates section fairly shortly with details on how to log into the Vault system (Password Management System) as it has undergone and passed phase 2 Beta testing. This update will also stress our plans to ship during the month of March as well as how all of our backers will have the option to change their shipping addresses if they so require. This by no means places this project anywhere near a "con job". We have stressed in the past through our updates and our comments/emails/messages that we have been delayed to to circumstances beyond our control; that these delays have been overcome; and that we appreciate your patience as we have made it our utmost priority to deliver backer rewards in the fastest time frame allowable. Again, we thank you all for your continued patience. We stand by this project fully and are continue to stress that all rewards will be delivered with quality and craftsmanship that a project like this fully deserves. @Andy We're still aiming for a March ship date! We'll give everyone a heads up once they start moving. @Kevin Thank you! :) We really appreciate it. And thank everyone one of our backers for help making this project possible! We've had a few bumps along the way but we're really pleased with how things have turned out! We know everyone is getting anxious for an update and we should have one out fairly soon! @Derik Roger that. We'll have some good news for everyone fairly shortly. ;) We're just focusing on getting everything perfect, its been a long wait and we understand everyone's frustrations! We can't stress this enough, your rewards are literally the sole reason of our being lol! @Steven, @David, @Dim You know we love you right! :D We're doing EVERYTHING humanly possible to ship out during March :D @Sam There will be printed material as well as online digital files :) @Anslem Again, we're aiming to deliver the product as previously stated on previous updates. On that note, cocktails seem like a great idea! lol. @David A lot of people don't really know how detailed the manufacturing process actually is. A lot of care is taken into how devices weigh and feel in the hand, types of finishes used and how they wear over time and how well they minimize dirt/fingerprints etc. Also, physical feedback (for example the delicate clicks of the wheels spinning) and spring tensions to create the perfect "pff" once the unit is unlocked and releases the USB stick... It's one thing to see a large render on your screen and another thing to grasp an extremely well-made 8cm cylinder holding your most precious data :) When we say we're doing everything we can to make sure the end result will be "better" than expected; we mean it. Hope that helps guys! We know you've all been waiting very patiently and we really do appreciate it. We're working really hard to get this under wraps and we again, thank you for your kindness, patience, and continued support! :) @Aneurin Duly noted! The majority of our backers are looking for the most exceptional quality from the device and we're doing everything we can to make sure the end result will be BETTER than expected :) @Peter We're doing our best to deliver during this time period. @Daniel Naming conflict has been resolved and thankfully everything is going very smoothly. Parts have been ordered and as soon as they are made available, its an issue of minor assembly (thankfully the design of the unit is fairly simple to assemble), packaging, and off to your front doors! Hope that helps & thanks for your comments! @Mark LOL. We're doing our best given the circumstances. Again, we apologize sincerely for the delays. Our sole reason for existing now is to make sure all of our backers get an excellent product that far surpasses expectations and in the quickest time possible. @Scott We did a heavy name search globally before launching actually. No one has used the word "Crypteks" on anything aside from an MMO weapon we came across. Thankfully though that situation is well behind us and we look forward to getting this project under-wraps. We really do understand the frustration and again we thank everyone for their kindness and continued support. We're more than certain everyone will be extremely satisfied with the end result and we're positive the end result will exceed everyone's expectations! Thanks for sharing. @Steven Not at all ;) We've simply been engaging our backers on the comments section and via msg :) Beta testing is going great! We had really no idea how many professional cryptographers were backing this project! :D We'll have something in the way of a major update pretty soon to keep everyone in-the-loop ;) @Sam So far, we're basically going to call it what it is, a cryptex USB :). As for the password management system, it is fully HTML5 compatible and accessible via mobile devices. We'll most likely have a mock app (icon) that will load a further iOS compatible version :) Hope that helps! @Marty "touche!" haha. We're trying to do our best to hurry things as fast as we can and we really appreciate the time and effort all of our backers take to let us know what's on their minds! A lot of people are very anxious to receive their units and we're doing or absolute BEST to ensure everyone will be satisfied in the end. Hopefully we'll remain as vigilante as ever and transparent about every detail we can; we owe you guys that much! Thank you for sharing :) @Seth We're fairly certain they have a registered patent for the cryptex unit they manufacture (replicas of the ones author Dan Brown mentioned in his book). Thankfully our internal mechanisms and use purposes are completely different. Thanks for that though :) @Kevin Basically, we will be UN-branding things :) See, we can use the word Cryptex (as it is a common word now and describes a certain type of unit). We are still keeping our stylized "C" logo. The only thing we are really going to do at this point is drop the TM and call the unit what it is; a Cryptex USB :) hope that helps! @WhyIsThisOpen hehe! Can you think about on for Michigan? :D @Rob No need to worry! Anyone that needs to update their shipping addresses may do so by either sending us a direct message here on Kickstarter with their new address, or by emailing us at <email> with the update. We will send you a confirmation message upon receipt of the new change of address! ;) @NBbrown The passwords used on the USB board is an enforced password (meaning, it is not stored anywhere). The password acts as the encryption key used by the hardware controller. Great question! @Dauzon We'll have to pass that one along to our board manufacturers! We'll have that answer for you pretty soon, thanks for your patience! @Maro We wish! haha, unfortunately no, we had to change all of the previous branding at our own expense but THANKFULLY that's all behind us now ;) The only thing they're being nice about is the actual Kickstarter page and the various renders and videos circulating around the www! (they're not expecting us to change or recall those thankfully!). We're all just very glad that this is all behind us and that we were able to reach a peaceful agreement with the trademark owners of Cryptek. Time to get rollin'! With respect to shipping, we're still hopefully looking forward to a mid-March release. Thanks for your patience guys! We really look forward to getting your rewards into your hands! @Philip Thanks for that question. We do not have any legal issues with the requesting company. We have mutually agreed to change the name and they were kind enough to allow us to phase out the current name without any problems! Hope that helps! @Yuhann Thank you for the vote of confidence! We're trying our absolute BEST to ensure all of our backers are taken care of in the most transparent way possible! Glad we could help! @Alicia, should be up and running pretty soon. Just a matter of integrating the shipping databases with each individual transaction number :) @Sam Would you mind posting the suggestion again? @Vanes Thought we might share your questions about the encryption process right here for everyone to share: We are using a PCBA solution from the world's largest producer of flash memory and NAND flash (not allowed to mention the name just yet!) - But a simple search should get you the right answer! :)... As for the encryption method, our PCBA boards use 256-bit AES block ciphering (CBC) mode - with an enforced password. To answer any questions about the Password Management System: NO - It is not necessary and has absolutely no bearing on the actual Crypteks unit. It's simply a nifty place to store all of your day-to-day passwords (or anything else really for that matter). @David Patience is a virtue! We can't wait to update all of our backers with all the goodness that chaotic manufacturing can unleash! We're really psyched with the end results and we know you guys will be too! Our manufacturing partners are simply unparalleled and we're really thankful for everyone that has been working on this project - especially our backers; whom without their kindness and support, none of this would have been possible! Thanks again everyone! @M.Guillaume Okay, 2nd attempt today! I've sent it from my personal email! Kindly let me know if it went through! Sorry about that. I look forward to your reply! @M.Guillaume Will do :) You should get your that custom logo ready if you can, Illustrator, Photoshop, jpg, bmp. It's all good :). @Ryan. We do apologize for not having a retail environment here on Kickstarter. The Crypteks units were essentially prototype concepts that we have had the privilege to custom build for our Kickstarter backers; they are in essence prototype units for a potential retail version. Again we do sincerely apologize for the naming issue that was brought upon us; we obviously had no intention nor the foresight for what the requesting company felt compelled to request of us. This has created an obstacle of sorts. Namely; we lost a lot of time as we simply could not ship out our units (as they were Crypteks branded). Secondly; it meant that we've basically had to redo the process of extruding/milling the units (as the previous units will have to be totally discarded due to the Crypteks laser engraved logos). This will fall upon us as a company and the financial heft of the undertaking was left for us to come up with. Aside from the physical units; the custom GUI of the encrypted boards have also needed to be unbranded. Based on our first run we have estimated that we will be able to begin supply to our Kickstarter backers mid March as per our official update. We're trying our very best to ensure that the units are exquisitely made with the quality specifications we have been adamant about since the inception of this project. We have extreme faith in our manufacturing partners and our engineering teams to ensure that our promises are made and fulfillment will continue to the delight of everyone involved. We do pardon the delay and we're doing our very best to continue this project as per the typical Kickstarter platform guidelines. Kickstarter was designed to allow for leeway for projects that might otherwise not have a chance to go through standard retail channels. To be able to overcome design/manufacturing delays, prototyping, assembly, packaging, etc. is one of the main reasons Kickstarter is such an innovative idea. By allowing potential backers to back prototypes and ideas; project creators are given the opportunity to provide their projects to backers that are aware of the initial system. Again we simply cannot stress enough how sorry we are for the general inconvenience that everyone has been subjected to. We find your comments and feedback very straight-forward and indeed agree with most of you. We will be providing frequent updates to where everything stands and hopefully respond to everyone's questions and concerns in a timely manner. We humbly request your continued patience and support at this time and we're certain we're doing everything we can to make sure all of our backers are well taken care of. Our company is dedicated to fulfilling our initial promises (though later than anticipated) and stand by our team and our teams dedication to the project, our ideals, and more importantly; our backers. Talk of non-fulfillment, fraudulence, or deception of any kind is simply a non-issue. We stand by our company and our commitment to our backers and try to remain as transparent as possible. Thank you everyone for you comments and feedback, please stay tuned to our official updates page for additional information. We will do our best to give everyone that has made a request a satisfactory response when permitted. Thanks again! @David Though we frequently comment and partake in technology and gadget blogs (and thus VERY familiar with avoiding trolling behavior on our end and general commenting etiquette); we would have appreciated the end of that quote: "Your requests for a refund though saddening, will go unattested and we do appreciate your support." Though its unfortunately that the naming issue ha hindered the monumental development of this project, we stand by our promises and guarantee that each and every backer will be justly rewarded for their kindness, support, and patience. We would never attest a refund from a backer regardless of their reasons for doing so. @Ryan Your request for a refund has gone unattested and we respect your wishes to do so. We do really appreciate your show of support and are deeply saddened that your faith in this project has been tarnished by the unfortunate turn of events that we have had to overcome. We will continue to post updates for you in the future and hopefully, we'll let you know immediately when you might be able to find us in a more suitable retail environment. We really do apologize for the inconvenience and will continue to try our best to make everyone happy! Thanks again for taking the time out everyone for giving us your feedback, we're listening and doing our best to remedy the situation. After-all, you're all just as much a part of this project now as we are! We won't let you down! @David Again, we're as frustrated as everyone else with the delay. Everything is however sorted with respect to the naming issue. We weren't able to keep keep the name as a trademark however they were nice enough to let us phase out the name and not have to deal with the hassle of changing any online videos or pictures (just not allowed to post any new ones). With respect to our partners at Bitwize, they are in fact located in Lebanon and do really great web work (they did afterall win site of the day at www.awwwards.com with their work on our website!) We would never hide this fact and are proud of our investors and backers as most of our backers are international in nature and we find that ingenuity stems from all walks of life. As for photos of prototypes and additional resources, we've had to step back a little from showing things without the use of the Crypteks name. They will be provided in due course however and we do thank you for your understanding. We had no control over this situation from the get-go and was never our intention to use a name that a company used in the 80's and might have problems with. @RyanMoore We would never in a million years stand in the way of a backer from removing their initial pledge. Unfortunately Kickstarter is set up in a way that once we receive funding and receive payment from Amazon, we cannot do much in the ways of monetary refunds. Your requests for a refund though saddening, will go unattested and we do appreciate your support. We apologize sincerely for the delays we have had with the naming issue however that has been solved. We did not have any legal problems with the respective company however bringing the issue to a court of law seemed rather drastic and we really just wanted to get our backers their rewards without further delay. Again, we thank you all for your continued patience. Feel free to drop us a line anytime, we'll do our very best to answer any questions or concerns regardless. We hope in due course we can show you all how hard we've been working and we stand by our promises that no backer will go unrewarded :) Hope that helps! @M.Guillaume We really do apologize for that! It seems as with Vanes that you may want to include exceptions for your junk-mail filters (mainly, allow @crypteks.com). As to your request and our 3 responses!; of course we will facilitate your personal request with respect to numbering and your branding! We're anxious to see how it might look and if the option might be something future potential customers might actually be interested in! We'll give it another 24 hours before forwarding you our previous response to allow you to tweak your email settings! -Cheers! Hey guys! A few updates: @Vanes again, we have sent your reply by email (might want to check your junkmail settings!) @Yuhann (again, sent via email but we'll post it here just in case), beta testers were selected for phase one and have been corresponding via Skype/email/instant messaging. Everyone else that has applied is being sent their login credentials and are currently in queue. (Sorry if this inconveniences anyone but testing security-based software needs to be thorough). Thankfully we have a few cryptographers and security specialists backing this project and their feedback has proven incalculable! @David @John we have sent our last official update here via comment Feb 2nd. We're trying to update everyone at least 2 times a week. With respect to the naming issue, we have had council to go ahead and change the company name and the name of the product (mainly, don't use the TM if we are using the word Crypteks. We understand everyone is in angst over the situation but we're really working round the clock to make sure everything is done properly and that the quality of the product is never sacrificed for speed. We're watching over everything and we're updating everyone accordingly :) All personal mails are being answered individually and comments are seen almost instantly. We're doing our best to look after everyone after this little naming issue. Thanks again everyone for taking the time to comment and give us your feedback! Hey everyone! Thanks to everyone that commented recently. We really appreciate the feedback (and advice!). @Sasha, @Larry: We totally agree. As we have always stressed, we owe it to our backers for full transparency at ALL times. You are as much a part of this project as we are and our main obligations are to our backers to not only fulfill their orders, but to also exceed their expectations. Unfortunately, the "naming" issue falls under the following category: (Sasha, you had the right idea about this), we are ALL for renaming. It's a simple ordeal that doesn't take much time at all. However: It would mean we have to re-cast anything bearing the Crypteks name. This of course is the underlying issue. If these guys could possibly let us continue using the name (as its based on the homophone "cryptex": which legally is now considered an actual common item!), then everything will go according to the original plan. They have YET to give us a final answer! We're just as frustrated as everyone else as we've basically had to sit and wait for an answer to make a potential move. As a company, we have every right to exist (even if we have to change our name) and our obligations will nonetheless be our utmost priority. We will always honor our obligations and we guarantee that every single backer will receive their respective rewards as soon as we can possibly deliver them! We really do appreciate the patience and we hope we can continue to garner your faith in us, our product, and our promise. (NB @Sasha: We would never not fulfill a reward and have the burden be placed on a backer. All payments will be accounted for 100%. Thankfully, there are no terms of length on a potential Amazon dispute for a lack of delivery of goods. We will honor our obligations to every single backer regardless of what a group of "innovation stiffing" lawyers have to say about it :D -- @Vincent: With respect to beta testing; we have officially received over 200 requests for phase 1 beta testing. All of our applicants will be involved in phase 2 testing (this should be in the next 48 hours. We will notify everyone of their unique access information via email and Kickstarter message. (Backers wishing to change their shipping information as well as vote for their favorite names may do so once we go live). Hope that helps guys! Feel free to keep the suggestions coming or drop us a line anytime! (Again, we really REALLY appreciate the patience!) Hey guys! Thank you all for your support! @Sasha, that's a really awesome idea actually. We're going to be posting something on our website so you guys can all give us your input! @Brentmills Thankfully it won't come to any of that! Our Kickstarter fulfillment is our top priority at this point and we will definitely have a solution in place to ensure proper fulfillment. Actually, we guarantee it! @Everyone We love your suggestions and as such, will be giving you all the opportunity to be more involved with the naming process. We are all ready with the password management system and it should be online in the next 24 hours. Your exclusive tracks will also be available. With respect to the legal notice, a copy will be available via our website and an official update will be posted to let everyone know how they can help and where we stand! Thanks again everyone for your support! We couldn't have done it without you! Hey guys. We're checking your comments on an hourly basis and answering emails and messages accordingly. @Vanes Kindly check your junkmail filters or maybe allow incoming mail from @crypteks.com. I'll personally re-send the message no worries! @Ken We'll be posting an update in a few hours hopefully with a better picture as to the nature of the delay (we really couldn't for a bit) but hopefully that's all taken care of. Though the update will be much more clear, we were made aware on Dec. 23rd that we needed permission to use a specific combination of letters to spell out a portion of a word we have been using (forgive the cloak-and-dagger tactics!) and had to work out a deal to continue (thankfully, they're good people and hopefully everyone will be happy). We'll keep you posted! And again, a thousand apologies for any delays, we're working non-stop for everyone and we're confident everyone will be satisfied with this project :) @Sam thanks :) We're trying OUR VERY BEST to make sure you guys get properly updated, please bear with us a little while longer. Hopefully you will all be updated appropriately and to everyone's satisfaction! (thought, a few of you msgd us and were spot-on as to the delay!). Thanks again everyone for your patience! You have no idea how much your consideration means to us! Feel free to drop us a line anytime, we are reading everything and updating as we can! Thanks for all the support guys! You have no idea how much it means to us. Thank you again for your patience. We're trying our best to answer all of your questions in a timely manner. We'll be posting an update in the next day to update everyone with respect to where we stand. Hopefully everything will be sorted out to everyone's satisfaction! Thanks to everyone that commented! And a thousand pardons for not answering everyone, we wanted to make sure we had the correct information before answering. Thanks again! @Mark No worries! We really are doing our absolute best to make sure everyone is happy. We always like to stress the fact that we will simply not succumb to cheaper manufacturing as the main appeal for the item is the high level of precision and quality materials we insist on using. We do apologize terribly however for the delay and rest assured we are working literally non-stop to make sure you guys are all satisfied. We'll be posting updates with respect to where everything stands and why the delays have occurred and we just hope you guys kindly continue your patience and support while we do whatever we can to ensure everyone is more than satisfied :) Hey guys! Firstly Happy Holidays! We apologize for the slight delay. A vast majority of our backers are international backers and we're having some issues with shipping charges! We will be setting up a special Amazon Payments system on our website to take care of everything! Thank you all for your patience at this time, we're doing our absolute best to make sure everything is done according to plan :) @Ben We hope so! :) We're really trying our best to bring the Crypteks USB™ to market. We'll keep you updated from time to time to let you guys know how far along we are. Hey guys! Just to answer a few questions: @Wendy shipping info will be requested slightly after DEC 23, 5:24AM EST. @David Thankfully, our hardware encryption solution is always active, its built into the electronics. As for systems not allowing an executable program, there really is no possible way but we're always looking into new technologies. @Curt We had a lot of requests for a Black model so we talked to our manufacturers to see if we could offer a special promotion right here on Kickstarter just for you guys ;) @Nick Backers pledging $130 or more are eligible to receive an Crypteks USB 8GB. We'd love to offer everyone one of our products but it might take a few years of saving up! @David lol! Seems like eons ago! We still can't believe we reached this far! We had originally planned to make 75 units! We're doing our ABSOLUTE best to fulfill our Kickstarter orders in a reasonable timeframe. We know everyone would never sacrifice quality for speed on this one so we're doing our best to make sure we adhere to our design philosophy and hope everyone will be satisfied at the end :) Thanks everyone! @William: Sorry about the confusion, we have a better explanation of the service in our project FAQ. If that doesn't clear things up, you're always welcome to drop us a line with more specific questions. Note: All Kickstarter backers will have access to this unique service when it is complete; updates as per usual will accompany the launch :) @evgenios glad that was taken care of! Drop us a line if we can help you with anything else! @Chris Try to send a private message when you get a chance and we'll take care of that request for you :) Thanks to Google translate! @Dauzon Merci pour votre gentillesse! @Rik We'll be requesting shipping info pretty soon ;) A lot of our international backers are having the typical kickstarter issue with adjusting pledges! We'll keep everyone posted with an official update later today to make sure everyone is taken care of! @Sasha Nice question! Currently the black version is going to be anodized using industry standard anodizing; we found powder coated aluminum to look great but since we have moving parts, we were afraid it would effect the smooth motion of the rings. We are always looking for interesting ways to improve our models though! With respect to the rings being interchangeable: 100%! you could technically use any color combination you wanted as all of the parts are the same! (We'd love to see screenshots of anyone brave enough to color theirs on their own!) Thanks for the question! @William Unfortunately at this time the Special Edition Crypteks USB can only be purchased at the 16GB capacity. We're trying really hard to please everyone but since we can't produce much larger quantities, we aren't able to make an 8GB black Crypteks USB for the time being. We're definitely working on it though! @Kevin: Of course! We figured that if WE were attached to our units, it might be a good idea to just have the "key" upgraded. This way, we can always offer the latest and greatest technology and still keep prices down! Thanks for the great question! Hey guys! Thank you all for all the kind words and your messages! We hope you like the new Special Edition Crypteks USB! If anyone needs any help with their pledges (sorry guys, we didn't design the Kickstarter interface!) drop us a line and we'll do our best to sort everything out! Thanks again! Give us a few minutes ;) "Ask and ye shall receive"!! Incredible! We're over 500% backed! You guys truly are awesome! We really really appreciate it! Thank you! @Sal we are working on getting some new images available (and we have a few surprises too!) so thank you and thank you all for your continued patience! We'll update every as soon as we can! Thank you everyone for leaving your comments! You seriously made our year! We hope to be able to address any questions we haven't answered so far, we'll get to each one (eventually!). Thanks again! You guys are seriously awesome! @David Thank you! And thank you ALL for allowing us to get this far! This really is beyond our wildest dreams! Uncrate and Gizmodo are our two favorite sites - It's such an honor! @Rik Rose: Definitely! We will be sending out questionnaires in the days to come with important information regarding shipping and final instructions! Backers!!** oops! But bakers will be too! :) @Kevin: I will have an answer for you VERY shortly! @ Johnny: All bakers will be given the option to have a "keychain hook" :) Thanks for the question Brent! Actually, we're not really familiar with how IronKey works however we do have a GUI for managing your passwords and additional features (such as limiting the number of incorrect password attempts for an auto format, FAQ's, etc.) as well as access to the Crypteks™ password management system (secure online management system) to be hosted on our encrypted server! Currently, there is no additional need for any software other than the proprietary software controlling the dedicated hardware encryption controller. We try to keep a minimalistic approach to design and it has followed through wonderfully with the user interface. Hope that helps! Sounds like a plan! We're planning on posting a few pictures and videos on how we tested (tortured?) a few of our babies! We have a few surprises for everyone and as always; we'll keep you posted as much as possible! Great question Daniel! Actually, our designers and engineers really stressed the issue. Obviously there is no such thing as an impervious physical lock, we decided the next best thing to secure the actual data (whats really important!) was to actually encrypt the entire drive! And not just any ordinary encryption would do! We went straight to the world-leaders in hardware encryption to find the perfect solution; Enter Fail-safe! In the event a physical breech has occurred (which we couldn't even fathom one of our babies being destroyed!); rest assured your data is 100% encrypted using the best cypher available. We did our very best to provide the best styling and ultra-secure mechanics possible to hamper a forced-entry, but "just in case" - you're always covered. Hope that helps! @gdep: You were officially our 70th backer and tipped the scale at $12,099!! Thank you and thank everyone that was involved in helping us reach our goal! You guys are our heroes! We can't wait to get ours either! :D So close! Wow guys! We really don't even really know what to say at this point! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Great questions! Unfortunately David there would be no way to ensure 100% encryption unless there was an enforced password. Systems that don't allow executable files to run are not covered in this case because we would not jeopardize the unit by allowing the password to be stored on the unit itself. You can however access it normally on any other system even if you don't have administrator rights! Hope that helps! You're very welcome! The optical drive disappears once the password has been entered, it will then register as a normal USB drive based on the next available drive letter you have (its pretty neat!). For reading and writing speeds, check out the image we posted on the project page under "Specifications". Let me know if that helps! Thanks for your comment Kevin! Basically the log-in process is very similar in both Windows and Mac OS X. Your computer will register the stick first as an optical drive and take you straight to the unique log-in screen where you will be prompted to enter your password. Assuming you enter the correct password, your computer will then detect your USB stick almost immediately and you are free to use the drive as you normally would. The entire process takes a few seconds. The encryption and decryption are handled by the unique Hardware Controller without any additional input so you're always 100% covered :) - Hope that helps! Hello there. We will begin manufacturing immediately after we meet our goal (and before the end of the campaign). We are still on schedule for a Christmas launch! As for designing, we are fine tweaking accessories at the moment :) but the Crypteks USB itself is 100% ready. - Hope that helps! Another excellent question! Yes actually, we may be implementing a key-chain-type feature for interested backers. There will also be a small carrying case (more like a pouch featuring a zipper) in the works. Hopefully we will finalize the details with the manufacturers before the end of the launch. As always, backers will be notified via email on any updates we might have! That's a great question. I'm not really familiar with how IronKey works, but in general, anything physical can be destroyed if you have a mind to do it. Thankfully though, even if you were somehow able to extract the unit within, it would be close to impossible to break the 256-bit AES Hardware Encryption (one of the reasons why we were adamant about it in the first place!). Your data is 100% encrypted with an enforced password :) You can also set your USB key to auto-format after a certain amount of "incorrect" guesses! Thank you so much for your feedback, great question! Thanks for your feedback! We tried really hard to make sure our storage capacities were as high as possible. Unfortunately when buying hardware encrypted drives there is always a slight sacrifice in capacity as the cost price is significantly higher! We're trying our best give the best data encryption possible while providing a competitively priced product! Thanks for your pledge! we really appreciate it!
