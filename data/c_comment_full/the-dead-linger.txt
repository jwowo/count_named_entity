@Mike Waters @Koriar @sabuk ketvirtis @Daniel Johansson and all others: If you did not receive a key, you simply need to send an email to <email> in order to get one. Provide kickstarter backer information (email used to back, for example) so we can quickly locate your key. @eXoScoriae: While we can easily prove we didn't pocket the money from the Kickstarter (payments were made to our team throughout), the premise itself for such hostility towards us is based on the false idea that the Kickstarter was for the creation of the full game. We specifically created and launched the Kickstarter in order to fund development for a 6 month period in order to release an alpha -- which we did, and then continued to maintain afterwards through other means (not Kickstarter funding) for greater than 2 years. If we had cancelled the project after 6 months without releasing the alpha, this would make a lot more sense. But that's not what happened. CORRECTION: Email tkeene [at] sandsweptstudios.com Please do not use the contact [at] address. @Joe: Please read the comment below yours. @Stephen: Please send us an email contact [at] sandsweptstudios.com, detail your problem (including username, email address, etc.) and we'll get your issue fixed as soon as possible! @SÃ¸ren: Maybe down the road! Email <email> if you have not received your code yet. - Bronson, We're working on the sound crash bug. It's somewhat common. - Liam, apparently you picked up a cursed banana. (Ok, we have no idea what that is. Report it on our bug report forum!) - Niels, Yes, we've sent codes. Email <email> if you have not received your code yet. @Kapol: We are sending the second $50+ codes out today. Website should be back up now. You guys killed it, so we just gave it CPR. Should be okay now. @Brandon Boyd; send an email to <email> if you have not received the forum medal or DETOUR copy. We'll be sure you get it. @Brandon Boyd; We are working dilligently. Please follow our blog at www.thedeadlinger.com and our twitter (@thedeadlinger) for future updates and information. Feel free to also become a part of our community & forums at www.sandswept.net/forums/! @Mike: Well... They're wrong. @Tom Pravetz: Please email Thomas at <email> and he'll sort it out for you. DETOUR codes have been all sent out. Contact us if you did not receive your's yet (only if you pledged via Kickstarter!) @Aksel Randomguy Hjerpbakk: Starting to send them out this week! @Elucid: Even those estimates are probably inaccurate. Everyone just remember to be patient, we're getting everything ready. @Draysen Foreman: Not for everyone. Clear your cache, try again. If it's still down, it just meansy our ISP hasn't resolved our new domain address now. Sorry about that! (<url>#!/thedeadlinger/status/197847124493336577) It'll be up soon (if it's not already) @David Seidl: The question clearly states that we only need a forum username for the forum medal. Put N/A if you don't want it. Everything else will still go to your email. @Xianthos: If you don't care about the forum medal, you don't have to register at all. @Chris Aquino: We will be sending out the DETOUR codes soon. We are still gathering surveys and we've been having some trouble with our email system. Patience, everyone! We will deliver soon. Eraser2011 is correct. Just provide us with as much info as you can so we can identify which Kickstarter and PayPal pledges combined are your's. @TheChosenOne: In the Kickstarter survey, not here... Scratch that last comment; registration no longer requires email activation until we correct the issue. Register away! Once you've signed up on the forums, just give us your username you registered with, even if you didn't get the activation email. We will have to manually activate some accounts, so you can login when we do. Keep an eye on @thedeadlinger twitter, we'll tweet when we activate a wave of accounts. Thanks, sorry about that! @Everyone: We love you guys and girls! We'll be sending out the Kickstarter surveys pretty soon in order to get emails and so on in order to send you codes in the future. Thank you all for your support! Stay tuned to our twitter and such (links in Update #12) to follow TDL's development! Thank you. @Ian: Feel free to post on our forums! <url>"Community Contributions" thing we plan on doing down the road should start here; (<url>"parties" are enemies) and see what kind of games you guys come up with from there, before we go ahead and add anything specific, like Capture the Flag or the gametype you suggest. Feel free to head over to our forums and discuss potential gametypes, I'm sure there's a ton of ideas out there for them! Thanks! @TheNote, We're quite familiar with Wolfire, and we love the stuff they do! We'll be doing vlogs fairly often, and hopefully some stuff you guys are looking for this very month. Stay tuned. @John, The Alpha release should be within 6 months. (June is a rough estimate, but not concrete yet.) The game (mostly the engine) has been in development for 6 months prior to this as well. @Kieron, I don't think we'll have 1-2 GB patches every month. That's a bit large. They could get fairly big. We'll keep in mind that some people are dealing with monthly bandwidth caps. Thanks for all the support! 50% in 5 days. Wow! You guys and girls are amazing. We'll be showing off some stuff soon, including "The Kickstarter" item. Stay tuned! @Michael, Digital yes. We can't afford to produce hard copies, but who knows -- maybe one day, if that's something people really want. @Jordan, We'll add this too. Less direct building, tons of modifying. As for actual building, fences and cinderblocks should allow for plenty of wall-building, among other things. Thanks for the questions! @Jordan, The barricading question has been asked quite a bit. We've just added a nice response to our Kickstarter FAQ. Hope this answers your question! <url>#project-faqs @Michael, The small piece of content could be a large number of things. We'll have to avoid copyrighted logos and names, but we'll see what we can do. That will all be sorted after if/when the goal is reached. P.S. we love you too! @Val, Yes, there will be lots of zombie variation, both in clothing, wounds, and base textures. Less variety during early alpha, and lots more later. (Also, it's not always a city. There's also towns, farmland, forests...) @Jordan, The only true dead is a headless zed. @Eric, No, we won't be faking or rendering our in-game screens. When you see it, you'll be seeing the real thing. @Eric, Not sure what you mean by "targeted rendering." And I believe you mean "skeptical"? @playmaker_41 The rendering engine we're using is Ogre 3D. Just remember, Alpha graphics =/= Release graphics. Also, $20,000! 1/3rd there! You guys are amazing! We may have to celebrate. Hey everyone! Just to clear this up; The Kickstarter item will not be something like a powerful gun. It's both functional and cosmetic, but it won't so much as cause a minor discrepancy in PvP or other balance. We're being very careful about the type of item. We're doing an update on it pretty soon, stay tuned! @Eric, To answer in short, yes, we'll diversify environments a ton. The early versions are less diverse and suffer from what you suggest here (somewhat repetitive), but it will rapidly evolve once the Alpha is out. More on that later! @Eric, Ah! Player location is saved on a per-server basis, completely separate from inventory and other things like that. If you leave (let's call it) "Server 1", you will come back in at the same place when you rejoin Server 1. Does that make sense? :) @Eric, I'm not sure where you read that, or perhaps I misunderstand? The game absolutely has persistent world exploration and dynamic spawning. @Jim, Of course! @Kieron, We don't have any plans for paid DLC right now. Everything we add to the game in updates (except exclusive stuff, like a special Kickstarter item) would be obtainable in game by everyone. Subject to change, I suppose, but once you've bought the game, you get Alpha, Beta, and the full game, plus updates to the original game. @Stefan, cool idea! @Eric, Your characters won't be linked to a server, you can move around between all the worlds you join. @Jordan, The servers will be run by you guys, we're not running a central server, except for some data storage (online characters, for example.) I'm sure there will be lots of Aussie servers! Thanks for the questions and support! @Kieron, We're taking that into account and will release whatever people need to get it going smoothly! @playmaker_41, Currently we have no plans for Steam (both by our own choice and the fact that Steam doesn't allow games in Alpha/Beta to be sold), but it's something we'd like to look into once the game is further along. Thanks! @Steven, The engine we're using currently support DirectX 9, but you can assume that will go up to 10 and 11 it at some point. If we go over the goal, even by a small amount, it means that we can do everything that much faster and much better, and the end result will be that much greater. @Kieron, LAN play? Yep! The DRM thing is being asked a lot. TDL will not have any DRM. It can be played offline/LAN and you can install it wherever you please. @headphonehalo, So do we! The more successful we are, the higher chance we can get it to OSX/Linux. Ok! Hey everybody, go to <url>"Forum Medal" was added later. The other is for a copy of the game.
