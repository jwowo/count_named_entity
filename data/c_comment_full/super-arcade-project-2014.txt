There actually has been updates via our blog and through twitter. I apologize to those who have no been updated as I have sent and replied to every message and email I have received. For those who don't follow our social media, we are almost done with our remodel at the new location and the backer plague will be posted there. In regards to t-shirts, we are still working with teespring to make the process 100x easier. We are paying teespring directly and will provide unique redemption codes for you guys to just log in and place your order that has already been paid for. Thank You for your patience as this relocation process has taken an eternity. If you have any questions feel free to send me a message and I will gladly answer them in a timely manner. Just posted an update for those of you with many questions. You can also see what improvements we did make by looking at our instagram <url>
