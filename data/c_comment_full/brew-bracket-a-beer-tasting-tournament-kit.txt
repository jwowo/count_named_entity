Sorry for the unmet expectations Vickie. We tried to be transparent about the selection but could have been more descriptive. We decided when building the project to stay away from glass for two reasons. We had a lot of trouble with breakage at past events (both in shipping and use) and the cost would have made for a pretty prohibitive price point. We're really proud of the type of plastic and density of glasses that we ended up with. Anything that could break too easily was set aside as an option as we wanted these to be robust as well as easily washable and therefore reusable. All that said, please email me at <email> and we can work out a refund if you aren't satisfied. We aim to please. Cheers! Kevin + Stephen - Thanks for the friendly ask on updates. You should have a big ole one in your inbox tonight. More to come every 2-3 weeks. Cheers!
