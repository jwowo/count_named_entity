Hi lightasafeder, Apologies for not getting back to you earlier. Your refund will be processed tomorrow morning. Jose, Karl, Theo, We aim to deliver your AirDogs during the January. Thanks, Janis Hi Michael Apologies for not getting back to you. I have sent you an e-mail containing all the details on how to proceed with canceling your order. Please check your inbox. Hi there, I have sent you an e-mail containing all the details on how to proceed with canceling your order. Please check your inbox. Hi Shane, Please reach out to us at <email> and we will provide you with all the details on how to cancel your order. We understand that this has been a long wait, however, we are exited to see great feedback coming in from customers who have received AirDog. Here is the latest video from our customer/beta tester Mark : <url>"Shipping & Billing" information. Hi Kenneth, We will ship AirDog in a high quality hard cardboard case that will have to work as a carrying case for now until we come up with a good solution for a hard case. Hi Cameron, We are preparing an update as we speak and it will be published on monday at the latest. Hi Chris, AirDog's box dimensions are 440 x 345 x 125 mm. The case in update #24 was what we first thought the packaging of AirDog would look like. In the end we decided to ship AirDog in a very durable, high quality hard cardboard box with a handle and protective foam inside, that you can travel around with. And most importantly - we think it looks very cool. :) The case from the picture in update #24 wasn't great and not as durable as we would like it to be. Rugged traveling case worthy of having AirDog inside will be available on our online store in the near future. Victor, its good that you asked this question since we are creating a completely new product category and it indeed requires some explanation not only to you alone. There are quite many drones out there that claim to have "Follow-me" feature. And that is the difference - to AirDog it is not a feature, but its core essence. AirDog does only that. It is built to follow (sometimes lead) you without any assistance and without sacrificing your performance in sports because you don't need to carry remote controller and smartphone which is impossible in many sports. AirDog has tailored flight modes for particular sports activities (surfing, kitesurfing, snowboarding, skatepark, wakeboard cable-park, wakeboard behind a boat etc.) this ensures great user experience, safety and drones ability to capture best shots in particular sports from videography point of view. Foldability is still a huge benefit when you are out for sports and need something very portable. Instead of folding props they are removable and total volume of AirDog is very small when folded. As the last thing but maybe the largest difference is that you don't need to have any drone control skills to operate AirDog. Just press a button to takeoff, follow, stop, change mode or return to home and all of that is in a small waterproof dedicated tracking device - AirLeash. To conclude it all - AirDog is for filming yourself in action even if you are alone and you don't know anything about drones, but you would buy your mentioned products when you want to have manual control and film everything except yourself. I agree that we will face serious competition in our niche, but isn't that true to every industry and product category? This is very immature and fast growing market and I believe we are in a very good position to set the standards for what an auto-follow drone in action sports really means. Seeing is believing and the true difference will be discovered in numerous product reviews and comparisons by independent media and users very soon. We respect your decisions in the past and will be happy to see you as our customer again when you will have enough confidence in AirDog as in product and us as a company. This is just the beginning. Edgars P.S. sure all spare parts including extra batteries will be available as soon as AirDog will start shipping. And its damn close. Dear Backers, Haydn, Guillaume, Edward, Maurice, Ricardo, Kevin, Berend, MaccaBot, Clarin, Cameron, Erich, Duncan, Thomas, 1997 Media and others, Thank you very much for the input, discussion and the heat we have had over the past few days. It was bitter to see the disappointment many of you expressed. We certainly made a mistake by being overly rational and not realizing how many of you outside US will feel about the shipping schedule proposed. We are fortunate to be in a situation where we can still go back and revise it. We agree that instead of prioritizing one region over another we should be shipping by the order of backing. Thus: first AirDogs will be sent to Kickstarter backers that volunteered for beta testers program the rest will be shipped by the order of backing We want to confirm once again that all AirDog Kickstarter backers community is the first to receive AirDogs. All backers will receive their AirDogs till the end of November, 2015. We will contact each one of you when we ship the product. Your experience, feedback and comments on AirDog are very important to us. We want to make sure AirDog is the drone you use to capture your outdoor adventures. Thank you. Edwin, Our customer support (by email to have your bank details confirmed for the refund) and Janis tried to get in touch with you during the day, please check your email and missed calls. As regards to your questions, I have said it a few times here, will do it one more time. Yes, we have enough cash to ship to all Kickstarter backers as well as to those that have pre-ordered. More than that, even when we do that we will have sufficient runway left. As regards to your second question nothing has changed the shipping order remains the same. Myself and Edgars did try to explain why, I don't think we can do a better job there. Agris Kipurs @Maurice Spare batteries will be available for purchase second week of September, as soon as our new website launches. We want to make sure your battery order links up with your existing Airdog order so that they are shipped out at he same time. Team AirDog Maurice, Any question in particular you think we still need to address? And always ready to jump on a call with anyone in case you think there is a longer conversation needed. Agris Kipurs Edwin, I don't think I can be more explicit with the answer. In my previous comments I also explained that we will fulfil all Kickstarter orders before preorders or distribution. Agris Kipurs Edvin, No you did not understand me correctly. We can and until we actually raise new money we will have all the Kickstarter units shipped. Agris Kipurs Backers, The support we received from you guys through Kickstarter was instrumental for the company, but we also had to raise venture capital of 2,5 mil to really give it a go. Besides you guys we also have investors on board who want to make sure we do most with their money. With our primary market being US and us unable to ship right away to everyone it makes a lot of sense to penetrate US market first and have our footprint there before we raise our next investment round. Don't get me wrong I am not trying to say that it was not our decision, I am just trying to explain what are the other factors we are juggling with. Hope it makes sense. Mourice and Solder, thanks for beating us up! We do appreciate you openly sharing the disappointment, we need that to grow as entrepreneurs and as a company. That said I believe all we can do at this point is work even harder to make sure performance of Airdog outweighs the disappointment of having to wait so long. Will not rest a day until you tell us you have your unit. Agris Kipurs Edwin, Clarin, I posted reply regarding shipping in last updates comments section. I think lets continue this conversation there. Duncan, your last question is covered there as well. Kevin, thanks for your comments and sharing your experience. Edgars Hi guys, We will contact each of you trough Kickstarter survey on Sunday evening to get a shipping address clarification. Since Kickstarter survey platform has its limitations we will focus on confirming your address only. Spare batteries, special backer bonus and other topics will be addressed separately. Please make sure you check you inbox and provide us with your shipping address information till August 31. @Duncan - We are working on it. Hi Kevin, Haven't seen any Airwheel users here in Riga yet. Surely you can bring yours with you and we'll think of something cool to do with it. Hi Duncan, More videos coming up. :) New update will be released by the end of this week. Survey e-mail will be sent out next week with a chance to order spare batteries as well. "Patient Backer Bonus" is being brainstormed about - we have some great ideas that we think you guys will be happy about. Hi Maurice, We are working on it - however you should understand that there will always be a balancing act between: sensor reading, movement estimation errors and fast reactions vs smooth camera movements. Our main focus is to get the best automated footage and we will be pushing the limits of our technology to achieve that. Hi Duncan, Airdog is splash proof as its electronics are covered with lacquer. Airdog can handle light rain and have survived after a full submersion test also. However we still recommend to use Airdog in dry conditions and not risk damaging it. <url>’t find any major issues in the test batch we continue with a larger batch - August 31st- we start shipping of the first batch Kind regards, AirDog team. Hey Duncan, AirDog has different Follow modes. One of them is designed for Path Following. This should work in your case. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hey Duncan, We stopped producing new videos to concentrate all our resources on testing, testing and testing to move R&D forward faster - thats why you don’t see new videos coming out. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hey Duncan, As you probably know our office and most of our team is situated in Latvia. Reason why we don't have any snowboarding/skiing videos is that we virtually didn't have any snow this winter and traveling just to shoot videos wasn't an option. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hey Duncan, Although our website still mentions foldable props, we have abandoned the idea of using them. As our update says we will be using regular props with a built-in metal thread. No need for for any kind of special tools. Regarding battery - we have upgraded AirDog to Interchangeable 14.8 V, 5500mAh, LiPo battery. Kickstarter page can not be edited. Kind regards, AirDog team. Dear backers, we are gathering all the info for the latest update. Stay tuned, we will publish our newest update by the end of today (US time)! Thank you for your trust and patience. Guys, we hear you, we will try to cover most of the questions in new update coming this week! Sincerely, AirDog Team Hey Loke, It is hard to tell right now, but most likely spare batteries will be sent as a separate package. Shipping cost will vary depending on how much batteries you get. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hey Asakky, We haven't sent out survey email just yet. We will be doing that couple of weeks before we start shipping. Kind regards, AirDog team. @Kent McCracken our servers were hacked today.. really sad that there are people out there doing that stuff.. But our web is back online. @Victor Go - our main R&D team is back in the lab and working! Stay tuned for CES updates on our instagram and twitter accounts @airdogteam Duncan and dear backers, We hear you. The next update is already in progress. We are shooting it today and tomorrow so it will be posted on Sunday or Monday the latest. This will be exactly what many of you have asked us for - not just a cool edited sports video, but a raw unedited footage of pre-production AirDog prototype in action from take-off till landing and other exciting news on our progress. Your patience is appreciated and will be rewarded. Cheers, Edgars, Team AirDog Hey Kevin, Dimensions of the latest AirLeash design are 75x52x21mm. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hey Kevin, Buttons on AirLeash are actually really hard to press accidentally. Simply advise the person wearing riders AirLeash not to change anything but if you really need something like this in case someone can't stop himself from playing with AirLeash buttons you will have to make something on your own. Maybe in the future we will make a smaller AirLeash as well, it is just too early to speculate. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hey Duncan, We use specific 4.0 Bluetooth long range modems. Not the same as in smartphones but compatible and they can work up to half a mile in ideal conditions. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hey guys, @Justin exact shipping dates cannot be confirmed until we have finalized engineering and the timeframe required from component suppliers. @Duncan We will provide default 12V power connector and video out connector from camera backdoor. There will be a dedicated place inside the AirDog body for a video transmitter. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hey Sam, We have received almost 100 requests and it was not easy to choose 10, but we have already chosen. Now we have to get final approval from our team and commence few Skype interviews. We will contact these people as soon as we have them approved from all team members. Test units will be shipped most probably in the beginning of December. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hey Kevin, Yes it is possible, to fly in the dark as well. AirDog will have navigation LED's preinstalled. Keep in mind that GoPro will have a hard time filming dark scene. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hey guys, @Lucas - We don't have the final price of our batteries yet. While we are testing our new sensor setup for the ground collision avoidance the rest of our team is working on fine tuning the flight modes that we already have and making everything work as smooth as possible. We will be talking more about our progress in our next update. Stay tuned. @Sam - New GoPro case is not required. If you already have GoPro 3 case than you are fine. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hey Lucas, Each battery will be custom fitted in its case and each of them will have indicator light so that you always know how much power has left. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hi, guys! Next update coming soon, and here's a sneek peek of batteries and new AirLeash! <url>“Ground” is a relatively large object. And AirDog’s distance and speed towards ground is relatively small. So It is possible to use “rangefinder” type sensors to detect unsafe distance to the ground and avoid collisions. Other types of obstacles, like trees, branches, poles, cables etc. are relatively small and drone moves quickly towards them, sometimes faster than 15m/s. “Rangefider” type sensors are able to detect objects at small ranges ~4-7m. So it’s not only difficult to detect them but also there’s not much time to react. @Sam - We have made our choice on what batteries we are going to use. It is just a matter of introducing them to our online store. Don't worry everyone will have time to order their spare batteries before we start shipping AirDogs. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hey guys, We have release our promised update today. Sorry for the delay. @Kynan - We are redesigning relative position follow to be more intuitive to use and more intellectual also. @Erich - Don't worry, AirLeash will definitely be available for purchase separately before we ship first batch of AirDogs to our Kickstarter backers. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hey Andy, Yes , AirDog will work equally well with both GoPro 4 black and silver Kind regards, AirDog team. Hey Guys, We will be releasing an update by the end of this week. Stay tuned. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hey Duncan, We have finally made our choice on what batteries we are going to use. We are working on introducing them to our website right now. In the next couple of days they will be available for purchase. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hey Michka, This is something we haven't yet thought about . It the future there will be many more flight modes available. As for right now we are focused on making the ones we have right now work flawlessly. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hey Sam, If you’re already an experienced remote control (RC) pilot, you’ll love AirDog’s manual flight features. Although AirDog boasts fully autonomous flight modes, you can also use it for FPV (First Person View) or indoor video shooting with your RC transmitter. Simply connect any TX module that supports PPM-sum, Spektrum satellite or Futaba S.BUS mode and has more than 6 channels, and fly AirDog completely manually. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hey Duncan, There won't be a battery heater built in. One thing we recommend when flying AirDog in subzero temperatures is that you keep your battery in the warm place before flying. We still haven't decided what maps we are going to use. But most likely we are looking to use google maps as it has the most coverage. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hey Justin, We are happy to hear that you have taken the initiative and opened up a forum. These last two months have been extremely busy for us but we are working on planning out AirDogs official forum right now and it will launch some time in October. Also, we would be happy to merge both forums and transfer the most popular topics. Thanks again for taking such great interest and being a part of always growing AirDog community. Kind regards, AirDog team Hey Lucas, We are still testing different brand batteries and haven't made our choice yet. Obstacle avoidance software is now in development process and we will start testing it pretty soon. We will definitely push an update as soon as we will be able to demonstrate it in action. Again this is only the software and doesn't impact production of drones themselves. You will be receiving constant software updates with new features even after you receive your AirDog. Kind regards, AirDog team Dear backers, there is nothing to be concerned about. We are working very hard and simultaneously doing a video update which we will post tomorrow (US time). Thanks for your understanding! Hey Sam, Yes, we are planning to have a "Mission planner" app. it will be developed after we we are done with all that is planned in the initial AirDog App. So this will come as an update a bit later after we will ship first AirDogs. Kind regards, AirDog team Hey Stephan, AirDog uses it's own custom implementation of the "following" functionality. Kind regards, AirDog team Hey guys! New video update coming - we have some new design and tech improvements! Going to share some insights in our work, lab and latest developments next week so - stay tuned. We will post update here and also send it out to our email newsletter subscribers (you all are in that list). Thanks again for backing us, AirDog project is looking good and moving forward! Edgars Rozentals, CEO and co-founder of AirDog Hey Justin, We will have an update about our progress in a one week's time. Thank you for your patience. Kind regards, AirDog team Hey Duncan, Results from the colour poll will be announced in the next couple of days. Stay tuned. Kind regards, AirDog team Hey Justin, Battery safety is something we are dealing with right now. We are still testing different brand batteries and the safest charger to include in our kit. Our charger will be preset on the exact cell count and charge rate to make sure you always charge your batteries the right way. Everything you need to know about battery safety will be described in our user manual. Also, li-po safe battery storage bag will be included in every kit. Kind regards, AirDog team Hey Jitesh. This is actually something we may consider as there are more people talking about this feature. Kind regards, AirDog team Hey Duncan, Yes, it is the sweet spot but we are working with the manufacturers to get higher weight/capacity ratio, so the capacity may rise till delivery. Kind regards, AirDog team Hey Scott, We are working hard to find a charger that will support 110-220 as well as 12v charging. Currently it is hard to tell if it will be available in our base package or as a upgrade. Kind regards, AirDog team Hey Duncan, There will be spare propellers included in every AirDog kit. Regarding other spare parts we haven’t yet decided on what they will be as we are still working on our final design. Our batteries have custom connectors that can withstand high vibrations to make sure they stay connected at all times so you will only be able to buy batteries from us because we want to make sure that they are made as safe as possible and never disconnect from AirDog during flight. Also, batteries will be custom fitted in its case and every one of them comes with calibration data for AirDogs battery monitoring system. Batteries will be a bit more expensive than standard batteries but we are still testing different brand batteries and haven't made our choice so cannot come up with final pricing yet. We want to make sure they will stand up for the task and will serve you for long time. Connecting FPV transmitter or Rc transmitter will not void the warranty. Kind regards, AirDog team Hey Michael, Let us clarify the last comment we made about retrieving AirDog when lost or stolen. Actually AirLeash registers last known coordinates of where AirDog was when it landed. So if it crashed and the battery disconnected from the AirDog you would know where it was just before the signal was lost. In case of AirDog being stolen there is little you can do because if its battery is disconnected, power is turned off or its out of AirLeash range you would not be able to find it. But the good news is that all the AirDog users will have their own unique smartphone app account so no one except actual owner would be able to configure AirDog. We will consider idea of making AirDog password secure where you would need to enter some sort of button combination on AirLeash to unlock AirDog. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hey Michael, AirLeash knows the exact coordinates of your AirDog and will signal when your AirDog unexpectedly lands so you can find it using our smartphone app. Also, AirDog will have some sort of a loud speaker to let you know if it's in a trouble or is going to land due to a failure. Kind regards, AirDog team. We are already researching some forum tools, Victor please send your suggestion to <email>, much appreciated! @primaldistro.com and @duncan - your concerns are understood. Our backers will have special price for AirLeash, and we will send you direct link where you will be able to acquire AirLeash for $195 Hi, since our human resource's focus is slightly shifted lately, we are a bit slow answering your comments here. Although we have answered all the Kickstarter messages (we still get lots of them) and e-mails and messages from our web page. So please excuse us for being slow answering your comments. About colors - we will publish color update very soon. @Duncan - yes you are right - Kickstarter orders first, then web-preorders, then retail. About our web pre-order price - for now we have not set up a distribution and we are able to sell it directly, but the price will go up as soon as distributors will add their margin. - YES we support Android! It was overlooked in our webpage, we will fix that. - @Matt "where you use the leash to record a route then the drone will fly that same pattern, when it does... will it need the leash?" yes, you will need AirLeash anyway! P.S. we will try to answer all other comments very soon, thank you for patience! Thank you for being our backers. Now the hard work continues and we promise to keep you updated! Sincerely yours, AirDog team. Sorry for double answers :) but you got it.. with within wifi range it will work. Hector, Sure we will have video feed in our app if you will connect your smartphone to GoPro via WiFI. Hi Héctor, Thank you for your suggestion. We are working on live broadcasting options, but current AirDog is not designed for this. At the moment it only possible to stream videos via GoPro WiFi and GoPro app as you mentioned , but it has limited range. Sincerely, AirDog Team. Luke, we think alike. We have on our roadmap some really cool accessories you will love but the AirLeash needed to become smaller no doubt about that. There will be some cool stuff coming out early next year! Duncan, AirDog has both a buzzer and LEDs as well (were not shown in prototype, but final version will have). Alarm function for locating is a great idea. It goes to our To Do list for sure. Thanks! Wow, you guys are awesome! Duncan, just received additional info from tech guys: AirDog also will have some sort of a loud speaker to let you know if it's in a trouble or is going to land due to a failure. Thanks Michael! That is very good to hear! Sorry, Duncan - update - Yes we are working on it: AirLeash knows the exact coordinates of your AirDog and will signal when your AirDog unexpectedly "lands" Hi Duncan, AirDog has no obstacle detection sensors so this feature is not possible for now. You have to set no fly zones on AirDog app before flight or carefully choose your movement trajectory to avoid AirDog hitting obstacles. Sincerely, AirDog Team. Hi Harry, Currently we have an option to ship either from our US or EU based company. Be free to provide your EU address and we will use our mother company based in Latvia to ship from. We will follow all the regulations needed , so everybody gets their AirDogs in time and with no problems . Sincerely, AirDog Team. Jitesh, Thanks! Yes, the size of AirLeash will is being reduced dramatically. We will be using much smaller components inside in final version. The display will be larger and better readable. We will show the latest design in our updates on our website after Kickstarter. We have no precise data yet on battery life for AirLeash, but we are aiming for a battery that will last for a full day of shooting. It seems that it will be more like rechargeable to save on size. Stephan, Thanks a lot for backing us! We highly value the trust all the backers have shown us and will do our best to ship in time. Sincerely, AirDog Team Zcass, 1) Yes we are planning to have a "Mission planner" app. it will be developed after we we are done with all that is planned in the initial AirDog App. So this will come as an update a bit later after we will ship first AirDogs. 2) As we know multirotors are not able to stay in air without stabilisation like planes or traditional helis. So sure as soon as you will release/center sticks the flight controller will stabilise the drone and level it. You will be able to turn off "GPS Hold" mode however. We are not sure at the moment if we would be adding more Acrobatic modes since it reduces the safety, but we are open to suggestions and ideas. Sincerely, AirDog Team Lorant, The batteries will be available for ordering on our on-line store shortly after KS. We are not able to clarify precise pricing on battery packs since we are testing several battery manufacturer batteries and pricing depends on which one we will select as final vendor. So do not worry, you will be able to order as many extra battery packs as you will like to be shipped together with your AirDogs. Sincerely, AirDog Team Hey 郭顯康, Yes, using AirDogs "Circle" mode simply select altitude and radius you want AirDog to be at and using arrow buttons on AirLeash command it to go left or right to make circular fly-around moves at the precise radius and speed. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hey Campbell, With advancements in lithium polymer battery capacity we will be increasing flight speeds gradually. There are test being held for different type of batteries that we might be using in the future that will be compatible with our current AirDog design. Kind regards, AirDog team. ChangHwan Seo , Technically to pair one AirLeash with 2 AirDogs is not a problem. We will not promise this to be included in first software version, but it may come as a software update later. Ol Jmdc, thanks for sharing.. we will definitely contact them and see if we can collaborate on this. Josh Evans, Thanks for sharing your opinion. You are right... in some cases this limitation can be unnecessary. We will think how we can ensure that you turn minimum altitude off when you really don't need it and you understand what you are doing. Good point about climber. We may be comparing the take off spot altitude (ground) and Air Leash altitude to determine that you actually are above ground and minimum is not really needed. Thats something we got to test in real life. We don't want to limit anyones creativity for sure. Justin, Thanks for your ideas.. we are testing some ideas like the virtual bubble you are suggesting, just a bit different. We have had no incidents hitting the rider but hitting a tree is more likely especially when you set an offset to one side and you forget to keep distance from a trees while doing your sports. Drone is unlikely to hit yourself since you would hear it coming too close and we haven't seen that happening actually. please keep on sharing your ideas and we will be keeping you guys updated all the time on our progress and whenever we will have an idea you wlil be the ones we will ask if you think this is how you would want it to use or not. Together we will be creating this totally new drone category. Thats so exciting, right? Sincerely, AirDog Team Hi Claudio, Just add 2 x $195 USD for extra two AirLeashes to you existing pledge. You can do this by entering amount you like in the box on top of the award selecting page. Before shipping we will contact every backer to confirm every order detail. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hi Benny Tang, AirDog will have accessory - floater, it is currently under development. Floater will allow AirDog to takeoff from water and land on water. Kind regards, AirDog team. To all who are asking about close up following... Actually most of videos AirDog is not further away from subject than 10 meters or 30 feet. That is the distance from which we are getting a better view since you can see some scenery around as well. It is a wide angle lens on GoPro that makes subjects look further away than they actually are. You can change your camera setting to "narrow" angle when you want it to look closer. In the production version we will be limiting minimum altitude to about 3m (9ft) above the altitude of the AirLeash to keep it safe and above everyones heads. We hope to manage to make a video of close following really soon. Our team is working on this right now. But what we have found from our experience is that you mostly will want to fly higher then 3m and have another camera on your board or helmet to combine with aerial shots and get awesome videos. Sincerely, AirDog Team Andy, we do not know what was the speed of the cars since it was varying all the time from around 30-120 km/h. Again all of the videos were done in Flight mode #2. There are different settings for it which you will quickly learn when you get your own AirDog. It is hard to explain in words but pretty easy to understand when you have the thing in the air. There was no manual override in these flights. All done with what current version can do and what you will be getting when we ship it will be much more advanced than this for sure. This is still just a prototype and we are releasing more flight modes every week. Will be posting new test videos regularly to keep you all updated also after Kickstarter will be over. Sincerely, AirDog Team Justin, Yes we couldn't say no to filming these super beauties :) It was a lot of fun and also responsibility so we kept it on a safe distance this time. (by the way it was a Bugatti Vitesse) Now regarding your questions: 1) we doubt if we will make the final app ready much sooner than the shipment of first batch. Actually to implement this obstacle avoidance solution we are now updating our electronics as well since we will need more memory to store this data. An this cannot be solved by a memory card because of read/write speed limitations. So we will be keeping you all informed how we are progressing and might create Beta Tester community who will have access to app before official launch on Apple store and Google Play. We will be having a forum as well where we will communicate everything so stay tuned. 2) Yes, you will have all of mentioned features in manual mode when using your radio. And you will be able to mix manual with Follow modes as well. For example you will be able to turn on/off following from your RC controller and other functions as well. Will be releasing details on our website soon. Sincerely, AirDog Team Hi primaldistro.com, We will publish the poll results very soon, we just want to make sure that every backer gets a chance to vote. You can vote for your favorite color scheme and 3 most favorite schemes will be included in final AirDog's design. Link to the poll is over here : <url>"magnetic north" from you, or any other angle you set before flight. 2) I will post 10 seconds for you in additional link 3) there are no tricks, we do the edit to show most interesting parts in video, so viewers don't get bored 4) we are flying our carbon frame because flying and crashing our very expensive 3d printed frames would simply be very expensive (remember to make plastic parts in injection moulds you have to spend $100 000 for the mould itself). We test electronics not frame, frame is irrelevant at this point. The size, the motors, the battery is the same. Stay tuned for link we will upload it very soon. Hey Joel, You can record the lap (the trajectory of the AirLeash), then edit the AirDog trajectory so it starts from the left side, for example, then transitions to the right side and so on, it's up to your creativity. Currently it is not possible to override distances and angles with the AirLeash while in the "follow track" mode, because the AirDog tries to follow the preprogrammed trajectories and if you change it's position - the trajectory breaks apart. You can use the second AirLeash in free-follow modes when exact positions are not preprogrammed though. Kind regards, AirDog team. @Victor currently we have no plans to make our software completely open, but we will work on API and connectivity options for developers. @Justin thanks for insightful commentary and questions. You are absolutely right, technology is not just there yet - either it is not performing good enough or it is waaay too expensive or too heavy to carry onboard (like this one <url>"record lap" function where you will be able to tweak your flight trajectory! There are lot of ideas and getting visual data from GoPro via backdoor connection would allow us to do some interesting things (amazing what can you achieve with simple camera and this <url>"Follow Track" mode AirDog will respect your speed. If you stop - it will stop too. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hey Dawin, Best way to do this would be to use "Follow track" mode. Simply go for one lap with AirLeash and it will record your track. Then adjust AirDogs trajectory to your liking in smartphone app. You can mark where the jumps are and set altitude for each of them separately. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hey Ruslan, If for any reason AirDog loses the AirLeash signal, it will hold its position at the point where signal was lost. The AirDog will hover for 30 seconds, then do one of the following: a) fly to the takeoff spot, or b) land at the spot where the signal was lost. You can set preferred behaviour using the AirDog mobile app. The AirLeash display warns you (flashing lights and sound signal) you when AirDog has reached 30% battery capacity. Additionally, AirLeash provides a warning when you should stop your run in order to allow AirDog to complete safe landing. If you are operating with remote takeoff and landing settings, AirDog will fly back to the takeoff spot and land automatically. You can also disable remote takeoff and landing settings so that it will land on sight when battery reaches critical point, warning you before, so you can guide it manually to safe landing spot if necessary. Airleash will record GPS coordinates of where AirDog was when it landed so you can find it using our smartphone app. Best regards, AirDog team. Justin, Im glad to hear that you are here to stay :) we really appreciate that a lot. This project wouldn't become real without your support. Regarding forums we are already in process of new website development and forum is part of it. It should go live in couple of weeks. Edgars Hey Matt, The AirLeash display warns you (flashing lights and sound signal) you when AirDog has reached 30% battery capacity. Additionally, AirLeash provides a warning when you should stop your run in order to allow AirDog to complete safe landing. If you are operating with remote takeoff and landing settings, AirDog will fly back to the takeoff spot and land automatically. Obviously if you are riding down a mountain you don't want AirDog to fly all the way back to take-off spot. In that case you can disable remote takeoff and landing settings so that it will land on sight when battery reaches critical point, warning you before, so you can guide it manually to safe landing spot if necessary. Also, it will record GPS coordinates of where AirDog was when it landed so you can find it using our smartphone app. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hey Justin, Yes, you can adjust roll and pitch in manual flight mode. Regards, AirDog team. Justin, I will try to explain you what is AirDog and how it differs from other RC controlled drones. AirDog originally is NOT built for manual piloting from a RC controller. We built it to do aerial video shooting in an automated way. AirDog aims camera (pitch/yaw/roll) at the AirLeash (tracking device). This means you do not need to control camera and gimbal. All you can do is to choose one of the flight modes that suits best your activity. You can set altitude and distance from you and you are good to go. The rest will be done by AirDog - it will follow you and film you. It will takeoff and land with a push of a button. We have left connectors for adding RC controller for experts who know how to do that and how to control drones manually and we will not go into explanations about this since there are many great forums and websites you can learn from. We do not encourage you to buy AirDog as your first drone for learning manual flight. There are cheap toy level drones that are excellent for learning to fly manually. AirDog is built for action sports enthusiasts and adventurous people in mind who actually do not care about owning a drone, but want to get aerial perspective from their GoPro camera. This is a drone for those who don't want to know how to actually control it I hope this will help you to make your decision to keep with AirDog or to choose something different, but we hope you stay with us and your pledge will help us to develop this personal drone technology. Regards, Edgars Rozentals CEO, AirDog Joel, this footage was taken with first try. We set altitude at about 30 ft (10) (higher in few shots) which was above small trees that you can see below and it simply followed without any prerecorded track. It would fly over power lines at this altitude as well. Camera settings were: 1080/50, Protune, Medum. We did no stabilisation only pushed through GoPro video app that enhances colours and sharpness. Andy, thanks for helping us by answering backer questions :D Darwin, in the cycling video we used flight mode Nr. 2. Relative position follow. Read more in Kickstarter project description. You can see that cyclist changes its direction but drone stays at the same relative angle. This way it creates an illusion of someone controlling the drone to achieve better cinematographic effect, but actually drone simply keeps the offset and the cyclist is the one that is turning and changing directions and we can see it from different sides. This makes video much more interesting than if it would simply follow from back all the time. Also we have set 5 meter freedom radius for drone in horizontal plane. It means it doesn't try to keep too precise in same offset again to reduce robotic look if we would force it to fly very very precisely. John, we are not using APM flight stack so we wont be collaborating on software development at the moment, but who knows. Our code is closed source for now. We think Pixhawk is a great flight controller from hardware point of view (APM flight stack is great as well, but we started our software long time ago and went our own way with it) and we want our products to be compatible with the upcoming hardware updates and new add-ons 3DR will be releasing in near future. So stay tuned! We will see how our communication with NPS will go :) Hi Justin, AirDog will have navigation LED's pre installed. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hey Justin, We have thought about this scenario as well. AirDog will refuse to fly this route if the starting point of the track is not close to Airleash. Sincerely, AirDog team. Hey Kirpa, Yes, DX6i will work as AirDog is compatible with PPM-sum, Spektrum satellite or Futaba S.BUS RC systems. Sincerely, AirDog team. Hey Garry, AirDog will not fly automatically indoors. This video was filmed using remote controller. Regards, AirDog team. Hey Kevin, Yes, it will be possible to record multiple tracks with different settings and name them to your liking. Regards, AirDog team. Hi Justin, Thanks for the good words, you will make us blush! :) As there are so many different RC's in the market. We recommend using the one your most familiar with and the one that fit your preferences as most of them can connect to AirDog. Simply connect any TX module that supports PPM-sum, Spektrum satellite or Futaba S.BUS mode and has more than 6 channels, and fly AirDog completely manually. I hope this helps, if you have any more questions please ask. Regards, AirDog team! Hi Justin and Lorant, Thanks for the questions. AirDog uses standard 4s LiPo batteries that are widely used in RC models. The charger we provide is optimized for optimal and safe charging to ensure that your batteries will last longer. Also, extra batteries will be available a bit later in our online store and you will be able to add them to your order and they will be shipped together. So you don't have to worry about extra shipping costs. Kind Regards, AirDog team! Hi Ian, Theoretically with 3D gimbal one can achieve better results, because the copter does not have to yaw it's body so gimbal can yaw smoother. This is done in big industrial copters for aerial photography as well as some hobby grade copters designed for hovering and flying slowly along straight paths. AirDog is designed for aggressive flying constantly changing its directions, during such maneuvers 3D gimbal would experience high overloads and would not work as during regular flights. Regards, AirDog team! Hi,Griffin, Rutger and Andy Thanks for your questions. AirDog will have an accessory to ensure safe landing on snow and soft sand. Although for most beaches the default landing gear works really well. Also, catching AirDog in midair is possible but it is quiet dangerous and we don not recommend this. I hope this help and if you have any more questions please don't hesitate to ask. Regards, AirDog team! Hi Ian Knight . There is no need to integrate 3D gimbal in the future . AirDog has 2 axis stabilisation. The gimbal stabilises roll and pitch and AirDog itself is adjusting yaw to keep rider in frame at all times. It has no difference if it needs to fly with camera forward, sideways or backwards to keep you in frame. 3D axis is used only for manually controlled drones where yaw of camera and drone are adjusted independently. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hi Nihal Friedel . Weather resistant means that AirDog is not bothered by pelting rain, freezing temps, massive waves, or freaking insane places. AirDog doesn’t say “no.” It just follows, flying right along. Electronics are covered with lack. So they are splash proof. We have tested several times water submersion and our prototypes have survived after them. If AirDog is dropped into salt water, be sure to disconnect the battery and rinse it with fresh water immediately to avoid salt crystallization on moving parts and electronics. AirDog must be removed from water immediately after crashing. The longer it stays in water and the deeper it sinks, the more likely it is to be damaged. At the moment we are not providing warranty on water crashes. If you'll have a need to takeoff from water and land on water AirDog will have accessory - floater, that is currently under development. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hey Justin, Its is not possible to adjust roll and pitch via Airleash or smartphone. The gimbal stabilises roll and pitch and AirDog itself is adjusting yaw to keep rider in frame at all times. But there is option to disable pointing camera to the AirLeash, so it is possible to take some sort of creative shots and fly AirDog using Airleash arrow buttons. We still recommend manual piloting via additional RC system if you require advanced movement control which includes controlling gimbal. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hey Andy Sydney, Thank you for taking interest in AirDog. We haven't tried attaching filters to GoPro, technically it could work but there is a possibility that this will affect gimbals performance Best regards, AirDog team. Hi Gary , Autonomous “Follow Me” flight mode is recommended only in open places with a strong GPS signal. However, if you have RC piloting skills, you can use your AirDog indoors and control it manually without the AirLeash or “Follow Me” functions. Best regards, AirDog team. Hey Andreas, Adding weight to AirDogs body can technically work but it needs to be distributed evenly otherwise it will affect manoeuvrability and flight dynamics. Best regards, AirDog team. Hey Andreas, Thank you for taking interest in AirDog. We share the values of GoPro as a company, and believe that it is by far the best action camera available. We have no plans to design AirDog with support for any other action camera in the nearest future. Best regards, AirDog team. Hey Nihal, Thank you for asking. Most of the setting will be tweakable by end users. We will provide default settings for each sport and you will be able to edit them to your liking. If you have any other questions don't hesitate to ask. Regards, AirDog team. Hey Justin, We have been developing AirDog for two years completely unaware that there is some other auto follow drone for action sports out there and only a day before our Kickstarter campaign another company claimed to have similar drone ready. Coincidence. Regarding obstacle avoidance solution we will disclose some further information in the near future. Best regards, AirDog team. Hey Solder, Thank you for taking interest in AirDog. It takes around an hour to fully charge the battery. We will announce information regarding spare batteries in the future. Stay tuned! Best regards, AirDog team. Hi Justin, Thank you for the good words, support and noticing that there are other companies "playing an unfair game". We have been working hard for the past 2 years to deliver everything that we promise and we will keep up the good work to prove everyone that it is possible. Thanks for the great suggestions and to be honest our technical team already was thinking about this feature as this could be very handy, especially in sports that you mentioned. We will keep everyone informed about any add-on or upgrade that we will be implementing on AirDog. Thanks again for your suggestions and support, Regards AirDog team! Hi Michael, Currently AirDog has this setting to disable pointing camera to the AirLeash, so it is possible to take some sort of creative shots and extremely easy to use. We still recommend manual piloting via additional RC system if you require advanced movement control. We definitely will add more creative modes as future software updates based on the feedback from our community. Thank you for your support! Sincerely, AirDog team. Hi Joel and Kevin, As you already probably know our speed is limited by software. This is due to conserving battery. Faster you fly, less the flight time. We believe that 40 mph is decent speed for AirDog to keep up. It has some latitude, and will keep up when you slow down again. With advancements in lithium polymer battery capacity we will be increasing flight speeds gradually in the future . Sincerely, AirDog team. Hi Kevin, There is no estimated delay in delivery schedule. Everyone will still get their AirDogs in November 2014 in US as well as outside US with no added cost to their existing pledge. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hey Ravy, AirDog team is dedicated to the ultimate quality and performance. Our drones are crafted for perfection. We reserve our right to release a complete and ready to use product to ensure the best user experience possible. P.S. You don't ask for a DIY GoPro or DIY iPhone, right? :) Sincerely, AirDog team. Hi Kevin and John, I read your communication with a lot of interest. I must admit you have been digging deep into FAAs interpretations. I do agree with your findings and conclusions. Just to add my 5 cents to the discussion. I still think that in general the goal behind FAAs efforts is to protect general public, at least as far as I can see. With that in mind I just can't see a surfer being prosecuted for shooting a video of himself no matter what type of drone technology he is using. Responsible usage is something I would take seriously as an individual though. Regards and thanks for your thoughts on these a lot discussed and important matters! Agris Kipurs co-founder Hey Kevin, Thank you for sharing your ideas and opinions. Opening up a forum is a great idea and we agree that this would be a good way for people to discuss any topic and share their thoughts about AirDog and everything related. We will seriously consider this idea. Kind regards, AirDog team. Hi Doua, Thank you. We will release our next stretch goal very soon. Stay tuned. Sincerely, AirDog team. Hello Pascal, AirDog weighs 1800g and the heavier it is the more stable it is. Also we have worked very hard on our design and aerodynamics to make it as stable as possible in windy conditions. Thank you for taking interest. If you have any more questions don't hesitate to ask. Best regards, AirDog team. Hey Kevin, Thanks for asking. AirDog will support MAVLINK dialect in the future and probably will be compatible with QGroundControl. Best regards, AirDog team. Hey Julien, Regarding AirLeash's battery it will last for about a day on a single charge. You can charge it via USB port with any USB charger you have at hand. Thank you for taking interest in AirDog. Best regards, AirDog team. Hey Pascal, Thank you for taking interest and sharing your ideas. Current construction of the gimbal does not support anything but GoPro in its casing. We are working on live broadcasting options, but current AirDog is not designed for this .At the moment it is only possible to stream videos via GoPro WiFi and GoPro app, but it has limited range. Sincerely, AirDog team. Hey Saurabh, We will develop different default settings for different sports which you will be able to select using our smartphone app. AirDog is made for any action sport but it probably works best in snowboarding, wake boarding and anything where jumps, tricks and some spectacular aerial footage is involved. Best regards, AirDog team. Hi John, AirDog was designed to be used for recreational purposes thus as long as it is used responsibly our backers will be fine. Was there something in particular you wanted to hear our opinion about? Regards, AirDog Team Hey Maurizio, Thank you for taking such great interest in AirDog and sharing your ideas with us. Sincerely, AirDog team. Hi Paul. AirDog can stay in relative position to AirLeash with a precision of 2- 3 meters. However when rider in MX for example will exceed AirDogs top speed or dynamic acceleration capabilities then AirDogs distance to AirLeash will increase until it will catch up with the rider or until rider will come back after next corner. Also when doing rapid direction changes AirDog has some preprogrammed delay in its trajectory change to keep video smooth and we have different settings for each sport that will be possible to adjust to your liking.. Whatever is the distance to the AirLeash it will always keep camera pointed at it. AirDog should not be used in very tight urban canyons close to buildings. This will relate to any GPS technology until we have obstacle avoidance sensors on board which will be available later as add-on. Very narrow forest trails also can be challenging if you are flying low under lush treetops because they might obstruct GPS signal. For these situations we have developed modes where it hovers above kicker or fast corner and aims camera at your you as you ride along. When you will receive your AirDog we suggest trying out different modes in unobstructed place so that you get better understanding how different modes work for you. But you always can make AirDog fly higher than obstacles to keep it safe. Best regards, AirDog team. Hi Doua. Yes you can turn off one of your AirDogs so AIRDOG BUDDY becomes AIRDOG MASTER. Any 2 AirLeashes (later even more) can be paired with any AirDog and any of them can work as Master or Rider AirLeash. Best regards, AirDog team. Hey Andreas, GoPro uses very little energy to operate and we are using relatively much larger battery to power AirDog so flight time is not affected. You will appreciate never having to worry about charging your GoPro and taking it out of its case. Best regards, AirDog team. Hey Paul, No we haven't tested AirDog on a race track yet but we will definitely do it. Using Auto-Follow mode AirDog will fall back on straights and catch up on turns but it won't know where the turns are so it will follow you at full speed and brake frantically when you cut corners, this can lead to Airleash getting out of range depending on speed in which you continue to drive. It depends a lot on track size and speed. For race track you can use "Follow track" mode as this is the safest way to operate AirDog. Simply go for one lap with AirLeash and it will record your track. Then adjust AirDogs trajectory to your liking in smartphone app. AirDog will repeatedly fly over the exact set trajectory and the camera will be continually adjusted to aim at the rider. Best regards, AirDog team. Hey Doua, You definitely can set one AirDog to fly to your left and one to your right in a safe distance from each other but you will need to wear two Airleshes on you for this to work. Best regards, AirDog team. Hi Kristjan, Our tracking solution relies on GPS and inertial sensors working together and it is not possible to track Airleash without GPS signal. Thats why tracking will not work indoors. Best regards, AirDog team. Hey David, Filming for 10 - 20 minutes isn’t an issue but if you own multiple sets of AirDog batteries then your GoPro battery will run out before your flight time. It may sound confusing but when filming action sports you will appreciate not having to unscrew GoPro casing and changing its battery. Its all about efficiency, changing Airdogs battery literally takes 5 seconds. Sincerely, Airdog team. Hey Paul, Rewards will be shipped to all of our backers at the same time. Best regards AirDog team. Hey Kristjan, AirDog is using GPS and inertial navigation system, this makes for very precise tracking calculating the position, orientation, and velocity (direction and speed of movement) of a moving object. Current system will not work indoors, but we will consider possible technologies for that. If you have RC piloting skills, you can use your AirDog indoors and control it manually you just need to add a compatible radio control system (PPM-sum, Spektrum satellite or Futaba S.BUS). Sincerely, AirDog team. Hi Pascal, No need to apologise we are happy to answer all of your questions. Current construction of the gimbal does not support balancing, so adding extra weight to it most likely won't work. Adding weight to Airdogs body can technically work but it needs to be distributed evenly otherwise it will affect maneuverability and flight dynamics. Best regards, AirDog team. Hey Shaun, Have you considered choosing AirDog Master as your reward where extra Airleash is already included? We will announce information regarding spare batteries in the future. Thank you for your patience and support. Sincerely, AirDog team. Hey Doua, Thanks for your support and taking interest in AirDog. Details about flight controller is going to be disclosed later, thank you for understanding. Technically it is possible to pair two Airdogs with one Airleash, but using Airdogs in this manner can potentially be dangerous as AirDogs will not "see" each other so there is a chance of collision. Perhaps this feature will be enabled later, when we have collision avoidance technology ready. Best regards, AirDog team. No worries we are here to answer all of your questions so don't hesitate to ask. 1. AirDog is designed for 5m/s vertical speeds 2. AirDog will have navigation LED's preinstalled. We will look into possibility to support external user added LEDs, thank you for the idea. 3. Battery cost is something we can't comment on for now. 4. At the moment you can preorder Airdog on Kickstarter. You just have to select pledge you desire and back us, so this way you will get AirDog delivered to you in November 2014. 5. When new GoPro comes out, we will make new mounts for the new camera if it will be necessary and they will be available in our website www.AirDog.com online store. 6. AirDog is designed with precision in mind. Extra battery will change weight distribution and can negatively affect the performance of the gimbal. Our 2-nd stretch goal is custom backdoor for the GoPro waterproof case that will allow to charge it from the flight battery, control camera functions and output video signal for FPV module. Best regards, AirDog team. Hi Fuad, Thank you for asking. AirDog reports most vital telemetry data to the AirLeash (or both AirLeashes in Master setup): It's mode, battery state, and signal strength. No external telemetry is supported so far. Sincerely, AirDog team. Hi Jeff, Thanks for the blog post, guys from Stonemaier Games have done a great job digging into complexity of international shipping. Currently we have an option to ship either from our US or EU based company. We will look into geographical distribution of our backers to assess whether there is something more we should and can do. For the time being I hope you have an option to provide either US or EU address for the shipment. And thanks again for the blog post, will keep it. Regards, AirDog Team Hi Elijah. We are working on warranty details but it will be different period for different parts of the drone. Regards, AirDog team! Hi Pascal, Yes, AirDog can carry some extra weight but it will affect it's performance. We are considering different options to provide video broadcasting solution, but for now it is still too early to promise anything. Regarding the API - we will announce the details later. Regards, AirDog team! Julien, AirDog cannot be compared to this sample because it works in completely different way. Lets see if we can explain this to you.... AirDog has 3 axis stabilisation. The gimbal stabilises roll and pitch and AirDog itself is adjusting yaw to keep rider in frame at all times. It has no difference if it needs to fly with camera forward, sideways or backwards to keep you in frame. So 3rd axis on gimbal is not needed. 3rd axis is used only for manually controlled drones where yaw of camera and drone are adjusted independently. Elijah, please see this update for more info on 2nd AirLeash: <url>"AirDog Master" pledge for $1,345 USD reward is AirDog Pilot kit + 2nd AirLeash remote for your assistant director . Your assistant can adjust distance, altitude and angle, change modes and presets, pause and restart the follow-mode. If the AirDog needs a battery change during the ride your assistant commands it to come down, changes the battery and lets it run again- return to track and continue filming. Julien, AirDog uses normal 4S LiPo inside a custom plastic case with connector and some electronics to monitor batt health. This way it is very easy and quick to slide it in&out to change batteries and also charging is simple. So you will need to order extra packs form us which ensures excellent user experience because of ease of use compared to hobby charging systems. Hyatham, GoPro has a small remote included in Black edition which would be your choice. It does all the things you are asking for wirelessly. Here is link to it: <url>’t an issue but if you own multiple sets of AirDog batteries then your GoPro battery will run out before your flight time. It may sound confusing but when filming action sports you will appreciate not having to unscrew GoPro casing and changing its batteries. Its all about efficiency, changing Airdogs battery literally takes 5 seconds. Sincerely, AirDog team. Hi Haytham, Thanks for your opinion and interest in AirDog! At the moment we are concentrating on technologies rather than accessories but we make note of every request we get. In future we will offer different accessories for AirDog in our online store. Thanks again for great ideas! If you have any more questions please don't hesitate to ask. Regards, AirDog team! Hi Pascal, Thanks for your support and interest in AirDog! We are not providing ready FPV solution at this moment, but it is possible to use GoPro WiFi and smartphone app for live video. The only disadvantage is that is has limited range. We have tested AirDog in conditions up to 25 knots. It is stable! The mathematics are simple. Currently we have limited max airspeed to 40 mph. When you will go directly against the wind the (maximum possible speed) = (Max speed) - (wind speed). In Kitesurfing mathematics are better since you are not going directly against wind but perpendicular. Yes, app will be released as soon as we release AirDogs. We are listening closely to our supporters and we will add some more languages if we have demand for it, but at first its going to be in English. If you have any others questions please don't hesitate to ask. Regards, AirDog team! Hi Adam, Thank you for your support and interest in AirDog! We are now working on videos that we could show and present to the world. In the new videos, people will have the chance to actually see the AirDog flying, following and working as we promised. If you have any other questions please don't hesitate to ask. Regards, AirDog team! Hi Roger, Thank you for your support and interest in AirDog! The thing is that drone must be perfectly balanced and so the camera on gimbal. Virb has longer form factor moving with to the front. Also this would add stress to gimbal motors. If we will have many potential customers then we might redesign the gimbal to work with Virb but since GoPro has 80% of the market we started with them. Feel free to ask any other questions you might have and we hope to see you among our supporters soon! Sincerely, AirDog Team Hey Julien. Its going to be both hardware and software upgrade and we are planning to make it as an add-on to our standard package. Sincerely, AirDog team. Hey James. Thank you for asking. Obstacle avoidance upgrade is still in its early stages and we can't really tell exact time when it will be available for our customers. If you have more questions don't hesitate to ask. Best regards, AirDog team. Hey Gerard. Thank you for asking. Thank you for asking. It won't be possible to run dual batteries or larger battery packs because it will affect weight distribution and flight dynamics. We are working on system efficiency improvements to make AirDog stay airborne longer. Yes we estimate that there will be accessories and spares available in our online store before November 2014. Best regards, Airdog team. Hi James, Thanks for taking interest in Airdog! We are working on obstacle avoidance technology and it will be compatible with current AirDog version (as an upgrade!). Feel free to ask any other questions you might have and we hope to see you among our supporters soon! Sincerely, AirDog Team Aobjects, We will disclose details on autopilot a bit later. You have to understand that at this moment it is pretty sensitive information. And yes we are working on API release and will announce release date as soon as our engineers are clear about it. 3rd party App developers will be welcome to expand versatility of AirDog even further. Hi Andy, Thanks for taking interest in Airdog! Either way: you can use WiFi or manual buttons. We are planning to design a backdoor for GoPro to power it from flight battery and control the camera from the flight controller, so when it is released the camera will be started/stopped automatically when your AirDog takes-off. Also the backdoor will have video-out signal from the GoPro and still keep it waterproof. AirLeash is designed so it will not interfere with WiFi. If you have any more questions please don't hesitate to ask. Regards, Airdog team! Hey Bobby. Thanks for your support. Main differences are: Waterproof tracker that enables you to shoot videos above water (surf, wake, kite) without range issues and with delayed take-off option; Full camera auto-control including pitch control - keeps you in the middle of the frame at all times; GoPro is in its protective case (AirDog is the only drone that offers this); Foldable design which makes AirDog easy to carry and store; Tracker is easy to use with gloves or on helmet when it is out of sight; There is no evidence that aggressive action sports following can be done with smartphone. AirDog has many advanced flight modes (six) like record lap, aim &shoot, circle around plus many dedicated modes for different action sports, because in every sports you need a bit different settings from our experience. It is not just about sending drone to a GPS coordinates; Increased wind resistance. We could have made it smaller and lighter, but scientific simulations led us to current design. If it is too light - stronger wind will blow it away; We are looking into adding pledge to our Kickstarter where the camera is included in the near future If you have any more questions please don't hesitate to ask Regards, Airdog team! Hi Srikeerthi, thanks for taking interest in Airdog! When new GoPro comes out, we will make new mounts for the new camera if it will be necessary and they will be available in our online store. If you have any more questions please don't hesitate to ask as we are here to help and clarify everything. Regards, Airdog team! Ben, thanks for good words :) 1. thats a good idea and we had it too, but since we are a startup we need to focus all our resources to main goals. And main goal is to have working technology. So we thought people will forgive us small missing things like t-shirts and stickers, but will not bad product. We really keep on product development all the time and getting ready for manufacturing. We will include stickers when we will ship out the AirDogs, ok? :) 2. read it below. 3. We couldn't get snowboarding footage because season was over when we were starting shooting for our Kickstarter campaign video. But the answer to your question is YES. AirDog can fly all the time in front of you, it is not a problem. Actually videos from the front look awesome.There will be several different modes that will do this, but it is no use to explain it here. We will cover it in users manual. You wont need much programming for it... its done with few presses of buttons on AirLeash. 4) Yes, of course the AirDog will follow your altitude. There are air pressure sensors on AirLeash and drone that are used to keep drone in fixed relative altitude to you AirLeash. This is one of major differences from other competitors who claim that their drones will follow smartphone. yes, it can follow, but vertical precision will be unacceptable. We tested that a year ago. Smartphones do not have these sensors and rely only on GPS which has error in altitude between 10-30 meters and even more on some devices. So in flat sports smartphone following might work because drone will just keep altitude relative to its takeoff spot. When you will want it to keep in precise offset from rider in downhill or even riding over large ramp it will become serious issue. AirDog team Daniel, we have mention it in our page that tracker size in production version will be reduced almost 2 times it total volume. Now it is a prototype. Also the display will be a bit larger. AiDog team John, tracker remotes (AirLeashes) are the same. You can select both to be trackers or one to be master in settings. We hope you get the idea now? AirDog team Hi Isac, here are answers to your questions: 1) AirDog has 4 small foldable landing gear. You can see them perfectly in the video footage where it is flying. We are sorry that we have made other photos without landing gear. We will update images with latest prototype photos soon. 2) First of all we are working on obstacle avoidance system. We cant yet tell the release date, but it will be available as an add-on for first version of AirDog. Secondly you will be able to shoot great aerial footage without it as well. Simply you got to try it for few times and see how best to position it so that when skiing you see it and you ski so that it keeps away from obstacles. Another solution is to put narrower camera angle and go higher above ski lifts. 4) Yes battery will operate in -20 but with one precondition - you must carry it in your ski jacket pocket close to your body to keep it warm till takeoff. When drone flies it will maintain its temperature. AirDog team Hey Jorgen and Michael, thanks for your support and interest in Airdog! Thanks again to all supporters that helped us reach our goal so fast, you are the best!!! If you have any more questions please don't hesitate to ask, we are here to help and clarify everything. Regards, Airdog team! Hi MarcR74, thanks for taking interest in Airdog! You are absolutely right! Airdog Buddy - you get two Airdogs and two AirLeashes Airdog Master - you get one Airdog and two AirLeashes If you have any more questions please don't hesitate to ask! Regards, Airdog team. Hi Nirav! Thanks for your support! The artist is ELVI/DUNIAN - IUNO, you can also listen to it here <url>"Follow Me Mode" relies on smartphone GPS sensors. The performance of GPS differs from phone to phone. So it's not really usable for action sports where agile maneuvers are required. Also note that 3D Robotics warns that their current beta software is experimental and unstable. AirDog has a dedicated motion tracker with sophisticated sensors and clever software that's far more precise and reliable than any smartphone out there. AirDog analyzes data from the tracker and calculates optimal trajectory and required maneuvers. Another major difference is that AirDog is totally autonomous from take-off to landing. You don't need RC skills to operate it, no need to play with your smartphone to send a command Thanks for question, Hisham! In our video we have mounted AirLeash on boat, it does not have to be on your wrist always. You can put it on your helmet as well. AirLeash is going to be at least one third smaller in final production design! We will be working on additional mount options very soon! Hi Srikeerthi, thank you for taking interest in Airdog! About RC - sure you can add your own RC TX and RX , and control it manually still having enabled or disabled auto-follow function. We have described this on kickstarter page, section "Manual piloting and FPV modes" Hi Gary, we are very happy about your enthusiasm! 1. During a ride AirLeash communicates to the AirDog via a dedicated radio link. We use 2.4Ghz frequencies for communication. By design there is no interferrence with Bluetooth or WiFi. Other RC systems could fail or interfere because they don't comply to standards. 2. AirDog’s warranty does not cover any water damage. However, AirDog has survived most water crashes. The electronics components within AirDog are coated with a waterproof lacquer. If AirDog is dropped into salt water, be sure to disconnect the battery and rinse it with fresh water immediately to avoid salt crystallization on moving parts and electronics. 3. Curently we don't have a plan to release a Windows Phone 8 app yet. Most of the settings for the AirDog can be set via AirLeash. Some advanced features like flight path editing are only available in the app because they require visual interface. We are thinking about PC and Mac software that could let you create presets and upload them to the AirDog. Thanks Airdog Team! Hi Simon, thank you for taking interest in Airdog! AirDog is designed for aggressive aerial maneuvers and it easily turns around to frame a perfect shot. So the third axis is not really required here. Also we designed AirDog to be foldable and packable without the hassle of attaching and detaching a gimbal hence the low profile and front mounted camera. Hi Jerry,thank you for your support! AirLeash connects to your phone via Bluetooth to let you upload presets and configure your drone. During a ride AirLeash communicates to the AirDog via a dedicated radio link. Thanks for your interest Nirav! Main differences are: -Waterproof tracker enables you to shoot over water (surf, wake, kite) without range issues and with delayed take-off option; -Full camera auto-control including pitch control - keeps you in the middle of the frame at all times; -GoPro is in its protective case (AirDog is the only drone that offers this); -Foldable design which makes AirDog easy to carry and store; -Tracker is easy to use with gloves or on helmet when it is out of sight; -There is no evidence that aggressive action sports following can be done with smartphone. If it would be possible all DIY enthusiasts would have made plenty of videos already, but we have not seen any . We also tried this solution initially. We abandoned the idea a year ago and developed AirLeash - with sophisticated algorithms and very precise sensors inside; -AirDog has many advanced flight modes (six) like record lap, aim&shoot, circle around plus many dedicated modes for different action sports, because in every sports you need a bit different settings from our experience. It is not just about sending drone to a GPS coordinates; -Increased wind resistance. We could have made it smaller and lighter, but scientific simulations led us to current design. If it is too light - stronger wind will blow it away; -Hexo+ seem to have forgotten to add some landing gear, and we don't want to land on our gimbal and GoPro, right? So we have a camera mounted in front. -All footage you see in our video is made with actual AirDog prototypes. Extra batteries will be available on our online store immediately after successful kickstarter campaign, price to be confirmed in couple of weeks. Hey, Simon. Currently AirDog supports GoPro Hero 3 cameras. However if there will be released new GoPro cameras, we will provide accessories and attachments. Older cameras like Hero 2 are not supported because of their weight. About RC - sure you can add your own RC TX and RX , and control it manually still having enabled or disabled auto-follow function. We have described this on kickstarter page, section "Manual piloting and FPV modes" Hi, Davis! AirDog needs open sky to communicate with GPS sattelite system. If you are skilled RC pilot you can fly indoors manually. Then you will need to buy additional remote control. Obstacle avoidance system is under development, and it will be compatible with current AirDog version (as an upgrade!)
