You are wrong IanR. The images you're referring to were rendered for packaging purposes only. The images you would find in the dropbox link below are of very real pre-production samples, which were made using the final tools at the factory. All of the images shared in an update last year were also of the actual items. All of the images on the website are also of the actual items. Check the EXIF data on the photos if you like: <url>"draw this project out", "Keep this rolling", "Smoke and mirrors" - in the context of a KS project - these things have no meaning. The funds raised have all been used - on the project and nothing else. You keep saying that you have no hopes of this project at all, so I question why you are even here... I've just reviewed all your comments - you've called me a fraud 9 times, a conman 4 times, scam/scammer 9 times, fraudulent 9 times, etc. You've made 69 comments - all of them derogatory, nearly all of them defamatory. So in my view you don't deserve a reward. You will need to visit a lawyer eventually, so maybe do that now - ask them if you can post whatever you like about someone online! Bear in mind that in defamation actions *you* would need to *prove* the truthfulness of a comment if you want to rely on that defence. Jason, since you have so far declined the terms of my offer for a refund, and you don't deserve a reward - you will *never* ever receive anything from me, so you are wasting your time here. I see little point in replying to you again. Ah... the Greek Chorus! James and Jason. Such earth shatteringly valuable comments. But the same question for you - why do you feel the need to come here and comment at all, what does it achieve? Here's an interesting article I read. <url>’s built on the continuum of inclusion and exclusion. This creates a set of common behavior patterns. First, members of a group lavish one another with praise so that they themselves might be accepted and praised in turn. Second, there are nonetheless enforcers within the group who build their personal power and reputation by policing the group and condemning those who break the group code. Social media can be vicious to those who don’t fit in. Twitter can erupt in instant ridicule for anyone who stumbles. Third, people are extremely anxious that their group might be condemned or denigrated. They demand instant respect and recognition for their group. They feel some moral wrong has been perpetrated when their group has been disrespected, and react with the most violent intensity. Crouch describes how video gamers viciously went after journalists, mostly women, who had criticized the misogyny of their games. Campus controversies get so hot so fast because even a minor slight to a group is perceived as a basic identity threat. The ultimate sin today, Crouch argues, is to criticize a group, especially on moral grounds. Talk of good and bad has to defer to talk about respect and recognition. Crouch writes, “Talk of right and wrong is troubling when it is accompanied by seeming indifference to the experience of shame that accompanies judgments of ‘immorality.’” He notes that this shame culture is different from the traditional shame cultures, the ones in Asia, for example. In traditional shame cultures the opposite of shame was honor or “face” — being known as a dignified and upstanding citizen. In the new shame culture, the opposite of shame is celebrity — to be attention-grabbing and aggressively unique on some media platform. Hi Robin, Great to hear from you - I wondered where you had got to! I'd missed the ever-so-serious dumbfounded* face staring into the bright light that is your profile photo... Thanks for the character assassination too, now a question about you - why do you feel the need to come here and call me a moron? What does it achieve? (*dimwitted also springs to mind) Apparently your grasp of written English is lacking? Obviously I care very much about the defamatory crap that you are posting. Most people would understand that the sentence "I don't care if you *think* you have a right to post whatever you want" comes with the implied ending "you don't". Defamation laws are different all over the world, and by "publishing" the comments that you have, you are liable for any damage caused by those words. WTF makes you think that you can post such derogatory things with impunity? Jon <url>"your money". As I posted here in September, the funds from YuFu project have been expended on the project and nothing else. To put your startlingly stupid analysis in simple terms. I have $100 in the bank. My friend deposits another $100 on condition that I use it to develop a product. I spend $100 on groceries and then pay $100 to an engineer. Applying your logic, you imply that I have misappropriated $100. That would make you a small minded moron. As I also said back in September, to that date, the cost to develop the software, the hardware and the industrial design for the project had been considerably more than the funds raised here. The completion of this project was always dependent on extra funding from me and by necessity, since mid 2014, I needed to apply my own funds that I had allocated to other things. So, if this project was to be completed at all depended entirely on whether I was able to raise more funds elsewhere - the pinheaded dimwits who have been tearing me down here for the last year based on a bullshit article about a groundless legal case have reduced the likelihood of the latter. I'm now exploring other options and will see how that pans out in the next month or two. I don't care if you *think* you have a right to post whatever you want. If on the one hand you want a project completed or refunded, and on the other you continually post spiteful crap; then you need your head examined. In any case, WTF makes you think you can post such derogatory things with impunity? You aren't anonymous, my lawyers know who you are and where you live. We are in discussion with KS regarding the defamatory comments on this forum. You better hope those discussions are fruitful, because if not - you are going to be held personally responsible for every word you have written. Jon <url>"wow, just wow", usually this is followed by the "can you believe this guy" stanza, and quite often ending in a long winded uninteresting diatribe telling me what I *must* do immediately. For what its worth... I've done a thorough audit of my emails with James from Procreate and I see nothing that should have precipitated their response. Perhaps Tasmanians think differently? I will refrain from releasing all of the emails between James and myself which would settle the matter, at least until I have legal advice. Many of *our* emails were ignored or went weeks to months between answers, if they got answered at all. Phone calls and Skype IM's were never answered or replied to. In contrast I have answered all emails from them, most recently in early August I said that the earliest we'd be able to support JaJa for iOS9 was with our next update which we couldn't complete before October. The Procreate comment in the latest iOS9 update is just churlish and ill considered (on many levels) but that's their choice. To state the obvious, they are removing support for a stylus with many 10's of 1,000's of users... i.e. they are harming their customers and seem to be celebrating that fact in the update text - weird! We don't sell the JaJa any more except for spare parts... Never-the-less, I had already committed to updating the SDK, and they weren't happy with that answer for some unknown reason. @Jeff, as I said - if you are a Procreate customer, complain to them - not me - it's beyond my control, and from the perspective of our worldwide mass market sales there are a lot of other important Apps. Procreate isn't that well known in the mass market. Hi All, Firstly, the YuFu project is very much alive. Secondly, regarding the procreate decision: whilst it's disappointing for you, it is not the end of the world - there are loads of Apps on the Appstore and the YuFu will work with Windows and Android. After reviewing my emails back and forth with Procreate, I found the tone of the Procreate comments to be more than a little surprising. The Procreate decision is ultimately going to impact their customers (you), and that is their choice - if you are not happy about that, discuss it with them - or find a different App. The YuFu is still very much going into production, although I'm waiting on a couple of things to align before I will proceed further (quote negotiations, lead times and so forth). So far, the expenditure on the development of the software, hardware and industrial design for the project is considerably over the funds raised here, but at this stage I intend to use my own resources to fund production. Just like many of you, I am keen to see the Apple Pencil, and if the iPad Pro allows us extra opportunity. With the release of that device imminent, it's going to be interesting to confirm that the YuFu will work on the screen. Obviously the iPad Pro tech could appear in future iPads of smaller size, and it's usually only a small tweak to make sure the electronics can be adapted for new screens Finally, I find little utility in posting updates or commenting here, it just unleashes a firestorm of negativity and abuse. If we can go a week or two without the hate, I might revise my thinking. However, I give the naysayers about an hour before I hear that's it's all my own doing, I brought it upon myself etc etc... <url>~$15,000, it's still earning reasonable income with very little work done since it launched in 2009... surprisingly, I don't regret launching it. @Virgil, it's people like you that make this all worthwhile. I apologise if you think this is some sort of shop where I have a big pile of stock out the back and I'm just keeping it from you for fun. I also note you live in the UK, go and watch the cricket or something. No @James, clearly you have some problems understanding the written word. Aren't you the guy who was going to charge the sale back with your bank? Why are you still here? The comment I made in the update was directed at people who either make, or repeat false, slanderous claims - I will be following up in due course. Particularly when those claims were made with intent to cause financial or personal damage. Read that text over next to the text entry box. -----> It's not hard - keep your negativity to yourself, it's pointless. Terence - if you are trying to compete with Charmianne for inane and superfluous comments, you have a long way to go. I'll give you some credit though - you are hitting the right tones with your banality. Charmianne - you have now made 141 negative comments - great work. Thanks for your input @barrett - please explain why you think it would be helpful? What would it achieve? Thanks @Barrett - Please stop trying to be a thorn in my side - It wont work. Not surprisingly, I have my own views on what is best for me and my company. I have no intention of changing my mind - my rules have stood since 2012, I've personally backed 63 projects and never demanded anything of creators. I've now wasted a couple of hours on this forum rather than doing something productive. So, if you want me to keep wasting time here, keep posting your essays - otherwise please leave me alone to get on with my work. Let me re-iterate what my rules are, since you might not have been listening: 1. I will do updates when there is sufficient information to justify one. 2. I won't do "heartbeat" updates - that is just dumb. 3. I am working on this and other projects, yes - they are taking longer than expected, I do not intend to share anything at all further about delays at this time. Except to say... 4. There are a lot of patents in this area of work and we need to make sure we work through any conflicts. (Patent problems have been the major reason for the delay - our electronics were ready a year ago, but we needed to redesign - I am not going to go into this further publicly) 5. etc below YuFu Pro Stylus www.yufustylus.com is the world's best pressure sensitive stylus.

The YuFu is available for pre-order at www.yufustylus.com Congratulations Charmianne 132 comments - more than 10%. Oh, and you worked out how to use google translate, good for you. @JK - I am not sure why you feel a need to "get it". Never-the-less, as I have spelled out before - here is the situation: 1. We had a design complete and working that relied on a particular method. 2. We could not implement that method. 3. We pursued another method which included a lot of material research - I don't want to share any of this information, nor am I obliged to. 4. The YuFu is shipping soon and you will get your reward. 5. I am working on it and have enough motivation to complete the project without being harangued and abused by people from the comfort of their arm chair. 6. There are very few people I have contempt for, I get disagreeable when I am personally abused or accused - when I am simply working on making a device that works how people expect. Most of the 1,261 comments below are from a small group of people - for example Charmianne has made 131 comments <url>"heartbeat" updates - that is just dumb. 3. I am working on this and other projects, yes - they are taking longer than expected, I do not intend to share anything at all further about delays at this time. Except to say... 4. There are a lot of patents in this area of work and we need to make sure we work through any conflicts. (Patent problems have been the major reason for the delay - our electronics were ready a year ago, but we needed to redesign - I am not going to go into this further publicly) 5. The follow-up emails sent to previous backers are offering kickstarter prices, if you choose not to purchase more product that is fine - remove yourself from the list! Each email has a link at the bottom - it isn't difficult to unsubscribe. 6. Some of you people need to get a grip and calm down - the average reward is $40, to bring the YuFu to market will cost me a LOT more than what was raised here - if you think this is a way to make money you should wake up. Kickstarter prices are below cost price. Just the SDK development costs around $50K. 7. I have every right to defend myself if people are being obnoxious and defaming me or my company. I will be dealing with defamation actions and seeking significant damages in due course - there is a lot of malicious intent with many of the comments. This forum is read in the UK, my company has a presence in the UK - <url>"We needed to lock down .... holds the PCB." That's fairly clear I think? -------------------------------------------------------------- Pressure Sensitive Stylus for iPad, Android and Windows tablets: www.yufustylus.com Bluetooth Weather Station: www.stormtag.co Connected Alarm Clock: www.aclock.co Charmianne, Stop being a troll - read the update. -------------------------------------------------------------- Pressure Sensitive Stylus for iPad, Android and Windows tablets: www.yufustylus.com Bluetooth Weather Station: www.stormtag.co Connected Alarm Clock: www.aclock.co Charmianne - that is answered in the update.

The workings of a product like this are damn close to witchcraft and it can't be demoed in a half done state. -------------------------------------------------------------- Pressure Sensitive Stylus for iPad, Android and Windows tablets: www.yufustylus.com Bluetooth Weather Station: www.stormtag.co Connected Alarm Clock: www.aclock.co Charmianne. I did that already. As I've said a lot of times - I will do updates when there is relevant information for all backers. As for "trawling through the comments", you've posted 115 of the 1013 comments... We have the T1 prototypes coming out from the factory - they left China yesterday. After we have checked them we'll hopefully get into full production of the basic YuFu. Unfortunately there are still some things to sort out with the electronics. Apologies for the apparent glacial pace of this project - there are a few reasons, but I will not be elaborating on them due to terms of NDA and licensing agreements. Paul - those libellous claims have been posted before and are completely false. To answer some questions from earlier - yes the fine point electronics work on iPad Air 2. I have been waiting on a revised board before doing an update - clearly we have had some technical difficulties and marketing/packaging material is ahead of production. When you see the electronics and how small everything is you might understand the delays. I can assure everyone that we're still working hard on this product, I have spent a lot of money building it, but still have sufficient to deliver it to everyone. Yes it's late, but it will be delivered. By repeating libellous or slanderous claims (defamation in USA), you are a party. We have your address, so - as I said we'll be in touch directly. I can accept copping some flack for late delivery, I can also put up with receiving advice from people who have never started a business, built a product or developed anything. But I will not put up with slander, your comments can be viewed in the UK where we have business interests, take a look at the laws there. That's pretty out of line Woo. A lot of libellous false claims there, so we'll be in touch with you directly. Robin, from memory you were charging back your transaction and were no longer a backer? You are the only person I've been intentionally rude to - but you know... you deserve it - seriously look at the never ending string of negativity and comments trying to stir up dissent: <url>"discrepancy". @Jason - read the update, I am not sure I can say it any other way. I will not be providing an exact date until it ships. Nor will I be answering any further questions on the matter. The update I provided today is substantial. That is all. @Jason - I think it would be best if you read the update and understand why the battery plan was changed. It isn't a design "flaw" until a product is manufactured. It's a design challenge which has been rectified prior to production. @Kurt - I will not be providing an exact date until it ships. I provided a progress update today that shows we are progressing. I'll provide another update in due course. @Arning - there are some important adjustments to parts that make the battery and tips work - these are the same parts in the Pro and the Note. If I released the Note early the replacement tips might not fit, so it is better to make sure everything is compatible. @Jeeb - thanks! That is my aim. @Robin - In case you hadn't realised it, I merely replied to your comment with the identical phraseology that you threw at me. In one breath you say my update is pointless, the next you call me a clown. You try and claim I am disgustingly rude? Seriously? What makes you think you are entitled to any better treatment than I am?? All of your comments to me and other creators have the same entitled, aggressive, negative tone and a waste of perfectly good pixels. @Charmianne - packaging is needed to protect the product, and it will ship in retail packaging with instructions barcode and all the rest. @Yu - I'll announce a shipping date when it is actually shipping and not before. @Tim - as you probably realise, most of the parts of the "YuFu Note" are the same as the other models, it just doesn't have the pcb. Those parts will all be manufactured together and are interchangeable. @Christopher - if anyone is being arrogant it isn't me... demanding a shipping date will not speed up delivery, I can't provide one until I am happy with the quality and functionality of the YuFu. @Second Guess - please don't :-) Robin, you've made another pointless comment. Seems like you make a habit of it: <url>"caught my ire". I'm simply not going to send product to someone who shows a *propensity* to chargeback. What's more if you think making threats of a chargeback is a good way to get a response - you are aren't thinking clearly. @Charmianne - It's very clear that the last few days "heat" has been caused by other styluses coming to market, I do admit that another update is overdue. I also thought it might be useful to comment publicly on how the YuFu differs from recently announced competitors products. I can assure you that the final product will be worth the wait! As you know, I have added a few features since first launching the campaign. YuFu will now ship with an *interchangeable* rechargeable battery - which you will get for no extra cost as a thank you for your patience. NONE of the added features have delayed the delivery schedule. More details on the battery plan in due course. SO the YuFu now has the following features which *no other stylus has*: - 1.9mm fine point tip - Pressure sensitivity in the tip for sketching and drawing - Pressure sensitivity in separate sensor in the grip which give pressure sensitivity with brush tips and as an option to tip pressure, for greater control - These two sensors also allow for opacity in the grip and line weight in the tip (if apps support this) - Interchangeable rechargeable battery - the batteries are charged by USB, but you can carry multiple batteries and snap them on if one runs flat. - cap to protect the tip from damage (a damaged tip will damage your screen) - cap protects the power switch to prevent accidental switch on in your bag - carry case - tilt, gyro, compass, accelerometer to allow for calligraphy, tilt sensitivity, and true palm rejection - we are also working on tip hover algorithms to show a hovering cursor without the tip touching the screen. The YuFu works with iOS, Windows 8.1 and Android 4.3 and will work with all Apps in fine point mode. Pressure sensitivity, palm rejection increased accuracy etc will work with integrated Apps. Thanks very much for your patience and understanding while we build the best stylus possible Get a grip folks. The last update was about 3 weeks ago, the next one will be soon. Some things take time, and this is one of them. Quite frankly it's clear that several of you think that you bought something from Amazon! Kickstarter is somewhere to back projects that you are excited about and when they are ready to ship you get one of the first in the world, in return you get a discount on eventual retail and you help bring something cool to market. It's also VERY clear that in the last 2 days a lot of people have seen the Wacom stylus and decided to get on here and demand a refund, so I thought it might be useful to clarify a few things for those people. 1. There will not be any refunds. As I have said - the project is underway and the funds you pledged are a commitment, in return I made a commitment to ship a reward to you when it was ready. 2. Yes there have been some delays which will result in late delivery - this doesn't change the commitment I mentioned in (1) 3. Rudeness, inappropriate language and other troll like behaviour will get you nowhere - but as a few particularly special individuals have learned there can be other consequences. 4. I CANNOT speed up manufacture, so please stop asking for me to do so - I'm working as fast as possible - is there seriously anyone who thinks I am delaying this deliberately - I have some large pending orders here and these delays are painful!!! 5. I'm not going give a date until it actually ships from our warehouse, so please stop asking for one. It might help the more impatient amongst you to just forget about it until the box gets delivered - that's what I do, with the 63 projects I have backed. It's kinda cool when a new toy gets delivered. Of course this comment will ignite another round of comments from the usual people who will say I am being arrogant, rude, condescending and there will even be one or two who say "how dare he suggest we just forget about it until it gets delivered" To those people I say, sorry in advance, I'm sure you will get over it - to everyone else, including all the private messages of support, thanks! Russ, I don't think you can claim to speak for anyone but yourself. Never-the-less, I am not acting superior to anyone. Really we could go back and forth for hours, but since you called me an asshole in your first ever comment, I might decline. Russ, thanks for your thoughtful comment, you've made the internet a better place... Wrong on all counts Jason, The last update was ~3 weeks ago, there a blog post at HEX3.co from the same day. I'll do the next update when there is something to update. If you read the comments below, it seems very much to me about people wanting a refund to go buy a new product from a competitor. I know you are new here, so I might remind you that this isn't a shop - you backed a product/project - you didn't buy something off the shelf... While you are reading the update here: <url>#comments take a sec to read the mature patient comments. Folks, please give the refund advice a rest. The way Kickstarter works is that backers decide to back a project and then see it through to completion. Just because some other shiny product has come along doesn't change things. Yes, there have been some unforeseen delays, but no - you will not get a refund. From my point of view we are working as fast as possible to get a fairly complex product to market. The backer funds are used and committed to do that, it simply isn't possible to refund a portion of these funds, it would jeopardise delivery for everyone. I appreciate the patience of the vast majority... @William - not much I can do there really except let the YuFu speak when it ships... For example one of the main complainants on that board is a lady from the UK (Leanna ) who felt aggrieved when UK customs charged her VAT upon import - she demanded we refund her the import tax or she would start posting bad reviews... Since then she has had a vendetta, and made all sorts slanderous claims against me and the JaJa. Posting literally hundreds of comments across Amazon, Youtube and Procreate... I have had about enough of her though, and I am considering options. @Charmianne - early on I made several comments about the DotPen, I won't make any more. Needless to say the YuFu will be significantly better due to how it works with it's Bluetooth/sensors that I mentioned below. @Charmianne - I am not sure which iPad you have. Procreate has won a couple of awards from Apple though. It's lightning fast on all of the iPads I have here... If you just installed it perhaps restart the iPad? @Charmianne - Try drawing a small circle slowly, or a slow diagonal line - I have tested a truglide here and it has exactly the same problems as all other generation 1 fine tip styluses. The lines are wavy and the line is offset when drawing on an angle. The YuFu is a vast improvement over anything available - firstly we have some new tech that prevents offset found in a lot of fine point styluses - near the edge of the screen offset becomes an issue. The cause is that the screen sensors are tricked by normal fine point styluses when they move between the 4mm x 4mm grid found on the screen, and the position info jumps from one sensor to the next. The onboard YuFu gyro and accelerometer sensors allow the App to know when you are drawing a straight line when the sensors on the iPad screen are being tricked into thinking a wavy line is being drawn. The YuFu has both a gyro and accelerometer so even when you are drawing whilst in an accelerating vehicle the line is rock solid. There is no latency from any stylus - styluses emulate a finger. What you are seeing is lag in the drawing engines of those Apps - try Procreate to see the lowest lag of any App - they use the full graphics processing capability of the iPad. Lag is normally hidden by the finger tip or a fat stylus tip and not all Apps perform perfectly. Bluetooth doesn't convey the positional data to the tablet, so there is no lag in line drawing caused by Bluetooth - in fact even our JaJa doesn't have any pressure sensing lag either and it uses high frequency sound... Data transfer speed of the information from Bluetooth is a tiny fraction of the refresh rate for your screen. So any data from the stylus will be transferred and processed a lot faster than the next frame can be drawn on screen. What is more - the data that we do convey over Bluetooth is for palm rejection and pressure info. Tip pressure sensitivity and grip pressure enable line density and thickness, whilst the tilt sensitivity, compass bearing, gyro and accelerometer will enable the palm rejection, and line thickness in some calligraphy style Apps. The stylus you mention has none of these features. From our huge array of sensors we'll potentially also have "cursor hover" if we can get it to work in some Apps it will enable air brushing above the surface for example - we are still experimenting with this, and it might come in a firmware/sdk update. Finally we have some cool new electronics that will automatically enable the fine point to work on any tablet with any screen protector, with no manual adjustment - our App will handle any tweaks required and update the firmware. Most other styluses will only work on a few devices since they all have different screen properties - for example I've tested and found different screen results between an iPad Air sold in Asia compared to one sold in Australia @Karl... you feel insulted? @Adrian feels insulted? Really? Please stop reading the comments section - maybe you have been reading some of the language that has been hurled at me..! Sorry - I have nothing further to add here. I'll do an update when we have some news - play amongst yourselves. @Adrian - please get a grip. Where have I insulted anyone?! I am not exactly sure what you trying to achieve with your comment - or is it just a general gripe trying to inflame opinion? Hi all, Some great and exciting developments happening with YuFu which I will cover in the next update. Please read the latest update if you missed it - it was 8 days ago. @Idontexist - I'm sorry, there are no refunds - we will deliver a great product to you. I'm pretty sure I answered your question a while back. I think that it's fair to say that there are two groups of backers: 1. There are almost 2000 backers who are willing to wait patiently for a great product, 20-30 of whom have offered words of encouragement and commented below that they would prefer to wait for something awesome. (thanks - I'm doing my best! :-). 2. There is a 5-6 person vocal minority who would prefer me to ship something *immediately* whether it works or not... or something. I'm working to satisfy group 1. Ultimately, I think this is a more responsible course of action - I'd rather have a few complaints now than 2000 complaints when YuFu ships. I'm sorry for the delay, but it will work out in the end. I'm working long hours on YuFu - it's going to be great and ship soon. For all the reasons you backed the project in the first place, you will be happy with it when you get it! Thanks! Jon @Charmianne - we'll be adding more staff in due course. The Kickstarters are to raise money for building and shipping product. @Rita - thanks for your support. @Adrian - please read the latest update I made last week, your comment is offensive. @William - there are so many steps involved - I need to make sure each part works before moving to the next, if we released parts that couldn't interoperate, that would be a major flaw. doing our best to get it all shipped asap. @all - please read the update that was posted 6 days ago. You will need to log in to see it. There is nothing further to add at this time, when there is - another update will be posted! Other Projects - as some of you have commented. I have other projects in the funding stage... as I said in my previous update: New Products - aka why are you crowd funding more products when the YuFu hasn't shipped? You might also note that I am continuing our program of expanding the HEX3 product line - with the aClock, Luvy and StormTag (now on Kickstarter). There are various stages to our new product development cycle and there are not many conflicts or overlaps. If there is a conflict for time or development, our highest priority product is the YuFu and this will remain so until it ships, new work is always delayed until after any YuFu work. Products can take 6-12 months to develop and the rough timeline might look like this: 1. Concept work - Jon and Industrial Designer 2. Full ID and prototype - Industrial Designer, Electronics Engineer, contracted prototype manufacturer. 3. Kickstarter campaign video and photography - Jon 4. Campaign - Jon 5. Electronics Engineering - this is time consuming and involves PCB manufacture, integration with other electronics in the case of YuFu, intellectual property registration and protection, sourcing long lead time parts, fabrication, testing, testing testing... then multiple iterations if required to rectify problems as they arise. This is definitely the longest and most frustrating time in any electronics project, since nothing else can start until EE is complete. EE blocks the final industrial design, tooling of parts, all manufacturing and software development. EE can also be expensive! As an example, it takes 3 weeks to make a new PCB if a change is required, it then needs to be tested before being revised if required - just 2 iterations of the PCB can take 2 months. But the thing is here - there are several weeks where the EE is waiting for parts, and other work can be done. 6a. Software - SDK development, can now begin. As soon as the firmware is completed the SDK developers make it work with Apps. 6b. Final ID, complete the support structure designs or chassis for the electronics. (concurrent with 6a) 7. Final working drawings to factories. 8. Tooling and manufacturing process. 9. Distribution As you can see, while I am supervising a lot of projects, each one is at a different stage and they can certainly overlap. No delays are caused by other projects. For example the aClock is now at stage 5 and the YuFu is at 6 and 7, the Luvy is at 4, and Stormtag is at 4. Importantly many of the internal electronics are the same in YuFu, aClock and StormTag - the BTLE chip for example - so we get economies of scale and similar software can often be used. Many of you have backed all of my projects, some of you just the YuFu either way; thanks for your faith in me - the YuFu really is a game changer and you will be very happy with it! Batteries! A few of you have asked about batteries... As I mention in the update - I'm using the extra time while I wait for parts to be made to devise a rechargeable battery for the YuFu which will be interchangeable, this will be available after the YuFu ships. So it will allow you to use both AAAA and also a rechargeable. Update Published - Thanks for your patience while we build the worlds most innovative stylus, we're working as fast as possible to deliver you the best stylus possible. BTW @Travis - I didn't blame other people, I mentioned that I had some personal matters to attend to on Friday afternoon which prevented me from completing the promised update at that time. @Travis - Thanks for keeping me on my toes, update is being written now. There will be an update in 7-10 days. Production has started, but there are still a few dots to join wrt firmware. Yes it's running a month late as of today. The delay was mentioned in my last update. For those of you who are anxious for delivery - I'm sorry, but this process can not be hurried. There is literally nothing I can so to speed things up any more. Things are progressing - a proper update will be posted soon. Thanks for your patience while we build the best stylus possible. BTW @Robin I can assure you that I am working as fast as possible to produce a great product. When you get your YuFu, you will understand what has taken the time..! @Robin - sorry you took my comment to be rude... which bit of my comment do you find offensive? @Siavash - yes. @Everybody - I have backed 60 projects myself and personally prefer to only get updates when there is real news, but maybe I am more patient than most? Constant updates will not change the time it takes. The YuFu is definitely progressing, although more slowly than I'd prefer. There are over 100 parts in the stylus and they obviously all have to work perfectly together before I can release the product. Anyone with any experience with product development will understand that good things take time and iterations in hardware can take a week or two - sometimes three! I'm working as quickly as possible but I will only do updates when there is real news to report. The YuFu will ship when it is ready, it *cannot* ship before that. I recommend that you read my last update regarding other project timelines, if you still have questions *that I have not answered already* please send a message. Thanks Travis, I'm not sure what the point of your comment was? Please read update #10, shipping update is mentioned there - maybe you missed that? For a schedule of when updates will be made please look at the schedule, it's found near the bottom of the project page, here's a link: <url>"updates". The most recent one was 7 days ago. I can't respond to every individual comment on all our kickstarter pages, but instead respond to the most common questions in updates. My team and I are focused on delivering product, so please have patience while we prioritize that. Questions about shipping, add-ons, address changes etc will be addressed in one update just prior to shipping, addressing any of these things now may lead to changes or confusion later. Individual questions of an URGENT nature can be sent to customer service here: <url>"I have requested Amazon to refund the full $80 of your transaction." and separately: "No you cannot change the pledge, the transaction has been refunded." Both statements are straight forward and should not require much clarification. That said, I'm terribly sorry that it has not been possible for me to handle this as rapidly as you would like... 1. You confirmed you wanted a refund on Sun, Jan 19, 2014 at 4:14 AM. 2. I attempted to refund via Amazon on Sunday afternoon, I got an error and emailed Amazon customer service. 3. Amazon replied to my customer service request on Mon, Jan 20, 2014 at 12:29 PM. 4. I have been on a plane, in bed or in a factory in Taiwan since then. 5. It's now almost midnight in Taiwan, and I have now taken the steps Amazon suggested to rectify the error. 6. Expect funds back in your account early next week. The end. Nothing more need be said, so I won't. Syreeta, Please calm down. As was said quite clearly in the last email to you - you will receive a refund for the full amount through Amazon. When we attempted to process that over the weekend their form gave an error, so we raised it with their customer service. Since you are getting a refund, your reward was cancelled; this should neither be mysterious nor surprising to you. Hi guys, no need to be concerned. Bamboo a Bee is the correct account, it's simply the old company name from before Hex3 was formed - when we did our first Kickstarter a few years ago. Thanks guys :-) Awesome, thanks for your support folks! :-) I think that makes it officially beer o'clock! 30 seconds folks - last chance! :-) Thanks - there's a few excited people here too! :-) @Angela, the Webpage will be updated next week when my web guy is back in the office. I would have preferred to have it pre-setup, but didn't get to it before the holidays! @Angela - after the Kickstarter ends we cannot edit the page, I changed it just in case I lose connection - I'm in a fairly remote area! :-) It's midday here on the Murray River in Australia! tick... tick... tick... :-) Prices are US Dollars. Not long to go now! @Steve - The case prototype we received needed to changes - the case and tips will definitely be worthwhile and the case will not be available separately after the campaign. @Gabriela - thanks! @William - when we collect the addresses and colors we will offer some extra tips for sale at that time. @Eric - yes so long as the Windows device has compass, gyro accelerometer we can support all features. @Syreeta - the difference between the Focus and Pro is negligible, the weight with battery is 19.5, the battery is around 6grams. The YuFu range are around the same weight as a mechanical pencil. @Rita - we might get there- it will be close! @Shadow - yes it includes the case and tips @Syreeta - I said "both the Focus and the Pro have the sensor in the same position and use the same finger pad mechanism". I also said the exact design might change a tiny bit. Hi folks, With 26 hours to go and $4690 to go, we still have a great chance of hitting the final stretch goal - please share and tweet - it all helps! Thanks for your enthusiasm. Here's something I just sent to one of our backers to answer some queries - I hope it clears things up... It's only just morning here in Australia... Kickstarter is a place where we get to meet our customers for the first time, so it's great to see the passion from our first customers! Kickstarter is also where we first hear about any problems or queries that they have about our products - this helps shape our products. Everyone knows that Kickstarter is not a shop, the products are not fully iterated, we have some work to do still and that is why we are raising money here. We are very advanced in our designs and software development and reached the stage where we are 100% confident of delivery, so we launched it on Kickstarter to fund the remaining software iterations and hardware tooling and manufacturing refinement. That said, both the Focus and the Pro have the sensor in the same position and use the same finger pad mechanism, the Focus will use a less expensive pressure sensor. The Pro has tighter tolerances on the pressure sensor - and in actual fact is capable of determining 10's of thousands of levels of force variation, largely irrelevant when dealing with the precision of the human hand and brain, but still it's there! :-) I hear what you say about the grip based pressure sensor, we know this hasn't been done before, and that we need to pay particular attention to ensuring it works exactly right. It works well, but without you holding one, of course it can't be demonstrated perfectly. I developed the first ever pressure sensitive stylus for the iPad a few years ago and everything we did there was totally new - even the use of high frequency sound instead of Bluetooth - (BTLE did not exist then) - so trust me, we know how to innovate and create new products! :-) Whilst we have working prototypes of all our products, the designs are by no means final and we can and will make small alterations over the next few months as we go into mass production with our factory and their engineers. Our backers know that we have their interests at heart - I know what people want, we know from 2 years of JaJa sales - and after all, I designed the product you see on our Kickstarter page! So whilst I say there might be some small changes, it's unlikely that you will see anything too different in the final product, and the design and features will be improved and refined. So the durability, manufacturability and importantly the usability will also improve - until we have a product suitable for the mass market. The palm rejection in the Focus relies on algorithms to determine your palm position - this is similar to how the Jot Touch and Pogo Connect work - but art Apps don't generally support this because the multi touch used in most Art Apps causes it to fail. (We added and accelerometer to the Focus to improve the accuracy of the tip position - this isn't used in Palm Rejection though.) In the Pro we have added a compass to determine the direction the YuFu is pointing, an accelerometer to determine the direction and speed of movement and a multi Axis gyroscope to determine the 3D orientation of the stylus. This data is all then compared to the iPad sensor data and the position of the stylus tip can be more accurately calculated - using some rather fancy code that is still being developed. We certainly have the design, and know it works, but funding the software development is part of the reason we are on Kickstarter. Also, here is a very rough feature table you might find useful: <url>"beamer"? @Thomas - I will take a look at that, but the Black Nickel version will give you the look you are after. @Michael - I'm sorry, but until our next round of prototypes is complete I can't demonstrate anything new. I had expected them before the holidays, but they have not been delivered yet. @Anthonny - our fine tip will be of a similar dimension to the Jot, but will be a softer material so it doesn't make as much noise. It will also be finer in the last few mm of the pen, so it provides more visibility. Thanks all - 6am New Years Eve here, I hope you have a fun time tonight where ever you are (and when ever your tonight is! :-) @Syreeta what I meant to add was, I am not sure that there any 1.5V rechargeables - often they are only 1.2V. What's more, and as I said - dismantling 9V batteries is not recommended at all by us. @H - I misread your question. Yes they will work. @Alexandre - will work with both. @H - it can only work on touch screens @Syreeta - not sure that there are rechargeable I'd recommend using proper AAAA rather than dismantling 9V. to add to my answer below... 1x AAAA will be included in the pack. But they are also available here: <url>"contact us", or "suggestions" page to ask for YuFu support! Thanks Hi Yudi, Yes that will work. Thanks Frank! Appreciate your support :-) Firstly sorry for the delayed response - there are several places we get messages on Kickstarter, and comments on the main project don't go into my "inbox" I missed these earlier. @Walter - for just basic navigation and the occasional quick line drawing or annotation the basic YuFu would be great - and it is a very nicely finished product as well. :-) @Gene - the rubber pad where you naturally rest your finger has the sensor under it - it's very simple to get used to, and feels quite natural. Our sensor is a real force sensor - not a movement sensor like both the Pogo and Jot, I will go into more depth about the sensor during an update this coming week. @Andrew - thanks, not totally convinced on the magnetic attachment :-) - but the main problem is the size, we are using every available space with electronics! I'll investigate further. @Rajesh - I wouldn't agree that I spring any surprises!! :-) Firstly the offset can be very easily fixed with some software changes, you will see in our "risks" section for Nota and also in the timeline of Nota that the final few weeks are improving the accuracy. Also, the apparent offset you see in the video is made worse by the parallax error caused by the camera angle. The App I am using has a larger offset towards either side - the offset really isn't very bad. I'll do a better video very soon to allay your fears! :-) @William - I'm thinking about expanding support for other OS, and also maybe doing another type of tip. Announcement soon. @Jokin - it is not that much. The important thing to understand is that there is not always the same offset with all Apps - there is a big variation in how different developers deal with parallax. When you use your finger the line appears under your finger and you cannot see it - fat tip styluses hide this, and ultrafine tips need some correction - we'll have something you are happy with I can assure you! @Mance @Alejandro - We'd love to see our styluses supported by these great Apps - the best way to get support for your favourite Apps is to email their customer support and ask. We obviously do what we can, but App developers listen to their users more than us :-) (don't leave reviews on their Apps) @Ron - As long as the Smartphone has support for Bluetooth4 (LE) the Focus and Pro will work on them in pressure sensitive mode - please consider that not all art and notes Apps are available in the smaller form factor though @Johnny - Yes the Art pack has 6 tips in total. We are still finalising the design for the case - I should have the prototype today. We will consider the size and comfortable use of the case in the final design. We won't be doing a fully round version - they roll of desks! The grip of our stylus is round though, and it is very comfortable. Most wooden pencils ever made were hexagonal - they stay where you put them on a flat surface and offer a little bit of rotational grip. I think you will be very happy with the comfort of the YuFu - it is also the lightest stylus available at just 19.5 grams with a battery. @Brian, yes correct - it work as a fine point stylus. @Graham our styluses work on all retina iPads and the iPad mini's. The Pogo has what they claim is an "exotic" pressure sensor - it's the reason that it doesn't work. Ours uses a far more robust system. I am not aware of the Wacom problems you mention. @Hao - I know my highest score with dots is with the JaJa Teflon tip! But sadly, I don't really get a lot of time to test out with games - I thinkt he brush would be quite good for the game syou mention though. @Wei - we are still finalising the battery budget for both and this won't be absolutely final until we have production units and compare the two - I would estimate the the Focus might have a 30% greater battery life. @Gaelan - the SDK software is still being worked on, I would hope to be able to demo this soon. @Kaijun - Yes, there is palm rejection on the Focus which uses an algorithm to determine where the side of your hand is resting. The far more advanced palm rejection is found in the Pro which uses the onboard sensors to determine orientation and tilt of the stylus compared to the iPad/tablet. Both systems need the Bluetooth LE to work with the iPad or Tablet. The basic YuFu has no palm rejection since it is not active and has no electronics. @Wei - yes it does have one spare tip @Darren - the ultrafine tips should last a considerable time - we are yet to do friction testing on production units. We are still finalising the construction of the production tip, we want to keep it pretty quiet though, so it will likely be silicon. @Rajesh - Yes the extra YuFu in the Art Set is a basic YuFu which can use any of the tips. I have a few people ask me a similar question, so I will get a table done up to explain it better. In the Art Set you get: 1. YuFu Pro with 2 ultrafine tips 2. The case with 3 spare tips - teflon, brush and 6mm rubber 3. A basic YuFu with a 6mm rubber and a Teflon tip. @Carlos, cool - well spotted. I can't get them delivered to me, but I will test them before we launch. The pack will come with a battery to get you started. The best price I found on Amazon was around $0.90. @Alejandro - you're welcome :-) @German - Yes, it will work with both iPad Mini (sorry for the slow replies - it's morning here, so will be on hand all day and night now :-) @Alejandro - The YuFu Pro will work only as a fine point stylus on the iPad 2, the pressure sensitivity, palm rejection, angle etc will not work because BluetoothLE is needed for that. All the spare tips will work just fine too - so if you were to buy the YuFu Pro you could use it now, and if/when you upgrade iPad in the future you will have the extra features... @Hao - Yes, there is power on/off. Yes there is an LED. It is very simple. thanks! :-) Yes, that will work Andrew. @Dominic, yes the ultrafine tip for the Focus and Pro will work on most tablets including the Nexus. The App support for pressure sensitivity etc will come when developers integrate the Apps. @Rajesh Firstly, that timeline shows shipping in January, the line with January under it is the *start* of January. The Nota is very much on schedule for shipping in January. Secondly - you will find an update here: <url>"manage your pledge" button. @William @occam, thanks! @Occam, we might try and do a soft case as a stretch goal. The hard case might look bigger in the drawing than it really is - I will have prototypes here in 7 days so you can see the scale. I'll get an image up with each of the colors named on it before the end of the campaign, for the moment please use the main image as a guide. The nickel plate I got as a sample is too silver for my liking - it is the right hand one in the main image - I wanted it a bit darker, I will work with our factory to get this exactly right. It will be something like this image: <url>
