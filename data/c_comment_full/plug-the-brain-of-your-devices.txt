@Javier Arce I invite you to contact the customer support, they will help you quickly: <url>"[Action needed] Your Lima is waiting!", did you get it? Basically, you just need to go on your backer dashboard (<url>’s an issue with your Lima so that they can help you out. You can send an email in Spanish if you want to. @Lior Happy to hear that! @Rick Borden I will check with support where they are on your case. @Rick Perez Glad you like the product :) @Jerry The software is still in Beta. Current versions are 0.11 on iOS and Android, and 0.10 on Mac and Windows. We’re no longer using the Google Group if it’s what you’re referring to? We’re now using the Lima Feedback Centre: just go on “Report a bug/Send Feedback” and you’ll be able to join the conversation with other users and Lima developers. Full explanation of how it works here: <url>’re far from saying adieu, although I surely appreciate your use of French words :) A plus tard ! @Mike We’re glad you like the headphones, and don’t hesitate to send an email to <email> if you have any problems with your Lima. @Everyone: the last weekly update is live! <url>’il se passe. @Amit We just sent you an email to confirm your address? Did you get it? (it’s your hotmail address). Otherwise, if you haven’t changed your shipping address, let me know and I’ll update the status for you. @Yashwanth I’ve just sent you an email to confirm your address. Did you get it? Otherwise, let me know if you haven’t changed it and I’ll update yours manually. @Sandip: The Lima app is indeed not compatible with El Capitan at the moment: we’ll release a new version of the app next week that will be compatible with El Capitan, right when it’s no longer in Beta. @Saurabh Panchal: We just need you to confirm your address and you’ll receive yours right away. I’ve just sent you an email to do so: did you get it? It’s your gmail email. @The Alamo: We just need you to confirm your address and you’ll receive yours right away. I’ve just sent you an email to do so: did you get it? It’s your aol email. @HotMayoSandwich I wish you had actually tried the Lima device before judging it. @Eduardo If you reported the problem on the Lima feedback Centre (“Report a bug/ Send feedback” on the Lima icon in the taskbar), support and tech team will get back to you shortly. @Swissmawi: When you install Lima, we ask you the permission to upload your pictures and videos. The app can’t upload the pictures if you haven’t given permission, so you must have done it without realizing it. If you want to change this, I suggest you go to the Settings of your smartphone/tablet, scroll down to “Lima”, click on privacy, and revoke the access to “Photos.” Note that you indeed control what you want on Lima or not. @Swissmawi Thanks for your feedback. Being able to rotate the app is indeed something that is planned but I don’t have a precise date yet. What I suggest is that you put it as an idea in the Lima Feedback Centre (just click on “Report a bug/ Send feedback” on the desktop app) so that you can raise awareness about this problem: the more people request it, the more prioritized this feature will be. @William: I’m sorry for this as it seems your address confirmation didn’t work. I’ve sent you a direct email to sort this through. @Marzsman Thanks for your feedback. Don't hesitate to check out the Lima Feedback Centre (Report a bug/ send feedback when you click on the Lima icon in your task bar) for your bugs and follow up on problems you might be having. Concerning the space take by the Lima database: this is only temporary. Once the files have been transferred to the hard drive attached to Lima, the space is released. @Lukas We just need you to confirm your address. I've just sent you an email to do that: did you get it? Your Lima will be shipped automatically once your address is confirmed (it's your Yahoo address) Hey Andrew,I've just sent you back the email to confirm your address. (gmail address) Once you confirm it, you'll receive an email with your tracking number once your Lima leaves the warehouse. @gouichi hatakeyama Google translate couldn’t help me on this one, sorry! Can you tell me what your question is in English please? @Lei Chen We just need you to confirm your shipping address and your Lima will be shipped right away. I’ve sent you the email to do so. did you get it? (it’s your gmail address) @Gail We need you to confirm your reward on your dashboard first, as mentioned by Narim by email. Did you receive the email to create your dashboard? Just fill it in and your Lima devices will leave our warehouse (you’ll receive an email with the tracking number when it does). @p-middy We know. It’s coming soon. @Ikalios: You should :) @Gary We need you to confirm your address: I’ve just sent you an email to do so (your Yahoo address). Did you get it? Just confirm and you’ll get your Lima right away. @Henry Young: Good to know :) @Stephen Have you tried contacting support yet? <email> @Jacques I will ping support on this and they’ll come back to you ASAP. @Terry we don’t have an official date about the end of the beta. As you know, we were never quite good with keeping deadlines :) But be sure that we’ll let you know. @Mayank I’m glad you were able to make it work! @Frank: We just need you to confirm your address and you’ll get yours by next week! I’ve sent you back the email to confirm your address (it’s your hotmail address). Did you get it this time? The weekly tech update is out! Check it out here: <url>’t. Can you please send an email to <email> giving your new address? They’ll be able to handle the case :) @Marv Would be happy to see you there :) @Seth We need you to confirm your address first. I’ve just sent you back the email to do so (it’s your gmail address). Did you get it? Once you confirm your address, your Lima will arrive within a week. @Patrick Great! We do not handle multiple drives yet but the feature will arrive in the near future. @Heather: Hey, we need you to confirm your address. I just sent you back the email to do that. Did you get it this time? (Your bigpond address) @Mayank Solving these type of problems is far easier in a direct conversation. Why don’t you give it a try? If your Lima is broken, we’ll provide a replacement but it’s very important for us to find out what’s going wrong in your situation. @Grant If your device is broken, we will replace it. I’m guessing the support team is waiting for an answer from the tech team and hasn’t got it yet but I’ll ping them to see where they are on your case. @Lorenzo: My bad. I promise I won’t forget next time! @Henrik This is strange. Can you please send an email to <email> with your final address? They’ll confirm it manually for you. @Christine I just sent you again the “confirm your address email”. Did you get it this time? It’s your Yahoo email address. @Karthik: We just need you to confirm your address and we’ll ship yours right away! I just sent you an email to do that: did you get it? @Casey Severin sent it today and I sincerely don't see how you could have found his email scornful as you seem to be implying. @Henrik: Just sent you back the email. Did you get it this time? @Mattias We’ve actually shipped already: I just need you to confirm your address to receive yours. I just sent you back an email so that you can confirm it (it’s your <email> address) @Bruno: Thanks for the heads up :) @Marius Very cool, thanks! @David Thanks for the heads up! @Adam: Your Lima was stuck in the warehouse for some reasons. Our team is on it, it should be able to elave tomorrow. @Jose I’ve just sent you the email again to confirm your address. Did you get it this time? @Casey I will check into this and come back to you. @Rui Enjoy! @Corey I’m sorry to hear that and I hope we’ll be able to change your mind in the future. @BrianS I mean “Desktop” “Downloads” “Pictures” “Music” “Documents”. @Steve Thanks for your comments and sorry for the unjustified suspicion you’re getting from some other backers. Unification indeed means that there will no longer be a Lima drive and that all your files will be synced automatically. @KC I don’t know where you’ve read that the back-up plan is no longer on our roadmap. This isn’t true. The back-up plan is one of our highest priorities and will arrive in one of the next releases (not 0.11 though). Not that it will change anything for you though, as you refused to receive a Lima device and have been issued a refund. But we know you can’t live without us, can you? :) @Michel It looks like you’ve just confirmed your address, so you should receive your Lima device early next week. Everything looks fine on our side, but if you haven’t received it by the end of next week, please send an email to <email> ! @Lorenzo: Thank you, I had indeed forgotten to post the link on the Kickstarter wall as I normally do. @Jason: The Lima device you received is the final product. The Lima software, however, is still in Beta. You can either start using it now (no danger for your files as long as you have back up), or wait for the software to come out of beta. We publish regular software updates (approx 1 every two weeks) that keep improving the software. We will notify you when we officially come out of beta. @Eugen, Let us know when you do! @Albert Lima doesn’t handle prepopulated drive at the moment, but it will soon. @Alan, I saw that you just confirmed your address so your Lima is on its way! @S. Peter Kane: Cool, enjoy! @Li Ting You should have received an email in July asking you to confirm your address so that you could receive your Lima device! I just sent the email back: did you get it this time? (It’s your hotmail address). Just confirm your address there and you’ll get yours in the next few days! If you still don’t see the email, check your spam and send an email to <email> so that they can help you out. @Jerry It’s Lee-ma. @Cedric Enjoy! @Kim You should have indeed received emails in July to confirm your shipping address and get your Lima device. I just sent you back the last email where you need to confirm your address to enable shipping. Your email address ends with “shaw.ca”. Did you get the email? If not, please send an email to <email> and they’ll confirm your address manually. @Jerry: WD MyCloud is a modern NAS device. You can see the differences just below. @Brian @Casey @Christopher Lewis: Lima is indeed part of the connected storage device family. However, classical NAS devices typically don’t require installing software on your computer: they appear as a hard drive on your computer but they use standard protocols to do so. Most of them won’t work outside of your home. Some modern NAS devices now have a software included that you can install on your computer. That enables you to connect to your NAS device more easily from outside. Lima goes beyond all of this. Its software: - is entirely P2P, which enables you to access your files from other devices even when your Lima device is offline, and without being limited by the upload connection at home, - enables to keep some files available offline if you want to, which is pretty useful when you don’t have an Internet connection. Another big innovation of Lima is unification - which isn’t publicly available yet. Thanks to it, Lima will soon be able to manage the content of your Users folders. That means you will no longer need to manually move files into a drive to have them on all of your devices. @Casey: “I put data from storage medium 1 to Lima storage medium, Why is is that LIMA is creating a secondary folder on Storage medium 1 in its own format, the same size as the data that was transferred to the LIMA in the first place?“ When you do this, the secondary folder on Storage medium 1 is simply cache. This folder will be emptied once the file you moved to Lima is correctly transferred to the Lima device. Thanks to this, you don’t have to wait for the copy of the Lima device to finish: the transfer happens in the background and you can enjoy your computer / shut it down and restart it, etc. @P-middy we will keep you updated when this feature arrives, which is indeed soon. @ronjadler: Thank you for your detailed feedback! Concerning Android app, we’re having stability issues with the latest release and it’s one of our n°1 priorities. It will be far more stable in v 0.11. Otherwise: - When you need individual support, you can send an email to <email> and they help you deal with it. - If you find a bug, you can send a bug report so that our developers have all the info (they can’t answer the messages though) - We actually do have an help center already that you can find right here: <url>’t advertise it enough as you couldn’t find it so we’ll make sure to fix that in the future! @Rift Thanks for your feedback. If it’s that slow, that means that there’s an issue somewhere. Is your device in relay or in P2P? (See that in PReferences while running the 0.10 version) @Daniel Cool, enjoy :) @Omri: Ok, perfect! @Cameron I’m sorry that you’re disappointed with Lima so far. I’m not sure I perfectly understand what happened in your experiment. Can you please give me more information on those 3 points: - where was your Lima device? At your home or at your friend’s house? - when you say “Lima went offline”, what are your referring to exactly? What you saw on your Preference on your desktop computer? What you saw on your smartphone? - what were you trying to see? That your devices could interact with each other by being on the same local network without using the Internet? @Sergio: Thanks for the heads up! @Jerry There are indeed some instabilities in the latest Android app version. We’ve identified the bug and it’s one of our highest priorities at the moment. @Tony I’ve also sent you back the email to confirm your address (its your address that finishes with .org). Just click on the confirm button and you’ll get your Lima next week. @Shannon: Unfortunately, a lot of other people have changed their addresses since then, which is why we needed to confirm it before sending the packages. I’ve just sent you another email to confirm your address (to your Yahoo address.). If you want me to confirm it for you, I can also do it right away. Let me know. @Casey We’re both losing time here. Lima is not a NAS. It doesn’t work the same way as a NAS. It doesn’t have the same features as a NAS. If you thought it was a NAS, fine, why did you back this project in the first place? @Omri From our records, your device is in Israel and is trying to get to you (you have all that information using your tracking number that was sent to you by email) The last status stays they attempted a delivery on August 16. Can you send an email to <email> so that they can help you figure out what this means? (They’re the experts). @Andreas Please see this with support and make sure to notify them that the USPS tracking number shows that the units haven’t been accepted. @Eduardo: The new files you put on your Lima drive should be available right away from your other devices by streaming from the originating device if it’s online or on the same local network. If that’s not the case, this is the bug and you should send a bug report. However, if you put files in the Lima drive and close your computer right away, it’s possible that those files aren’t available on other devices because Lima hasn’t had time to retrieve them and is the only source available when other devices are offline. @Oliver: From what I see, you haven’t confirmed your address yet which explains why you couldn’t receive your Lima (the email asking you to confirm it was sent on July 20: “We're shipping! Just confirm your address to receive your Lima :)”) I’ve just sent you back the email so you can confirm your address now and receive your Lima within a week. (Note that it’s your gmail address.) If you don't receive that email either or have changed your email address, please send an email to <email> and they'll help you out with this. @Kyle: You should have an AirPlay icon on your Lima app. @Casey: We are answering your questions. This wall isn’t very convenient to hold a conversation and we do not seem to understand each other. But if you don’t want to Skype, fine. We just feel it would have been easier to explain you, and we (Lima) could have learned from that in order to be clearer in the future. If you wish to record the conversation and share it with other users, you’re perfectly welcome to do it. Now, concerning your questions: > Why did you create a local database not on the Lima Storage medium? The product is not "just a NAS", it enables you to browse your files even when you’re offline. You can see all of your files; some are available locally, because you asked so explicitly (‘keep an offline version’) or because they are in cache, and some are not. Obviously we need a local database to do this. To be more precise, only the metadata of the filesystem (file tree) is in an actual database. The local and cached data itself (binary blobs) is stored in plain files. We sometimes mean both when we say "database". > Why is there no word on an audit regarding credibility/security of the current code? This is something we’re thinking about in the future, but not as of now. I don’t think it was ever something we promised. > Is there an access port where we can hack this device? No. The device isn’t meant to be hacked. > What system is this hardware based off of so we can easily put on a different firmware if need be? The hardware is a variant of the Wanser-R, as stated in the Kickstarter campaign. The device isn’t supposed to be used with a different software than Lima. @Scott: thanks for the heads up! @Jerry Note that there’s a cache that can take up to 10% of your available storage. Lima deals with this and won’t necessarily erase all of the temporary files if there’s still some cache left. More info on this in our last tech update: <url>’t read the files directly on the external hard drive attached to Lima. It’s a feature that will arrive soon. @Casey We have the impression that we keep answering the same question over and over again. Why don’t we schedule a call together, as we already offered, so that we can discuss this face to dace and understand what you don’t get about Lima? That will enable us to have insights on how to better explain it in the future to other people. @fmotta If all you wanted was Linux computer with the ability to install open source software on it, why didn’t you just get a Raspberry pi? @Michael: Install it by going to install.meetlima.com :) @Daniel: Can you send an email to <email> explaining this? It shouldn’t have had broken seals, and they’ll replace it if it proves broken. @Eduardo: this is an abnormal speed: can you check with <email> so that they can help you out on this? @Bill Can you please send an email to <email> and they’ll be able to send you back your device? @Rey Cool :) Enjoy! @Ahsan You should have received your Lima already… Can you please send an email to <email> and they’ll ship yours right away! @Norman: No prob! @Gerold: This is really weird. Have you sent a bug report yet? Do not hesitate to contact the support team (<email>) as they might help you figure out the problem here. @Gnome The software is indeed still in beta. We stopped using the term “beta tester” because we weren’t expecting you to send bug reports etc. but just to use the product normally. @Casey As promised, here are the answers for your questions from yesterday: - Concerning the creation of a database: Lima works internally a little like git. As git, there is an internal database which stores files in its own format (see the hidden folder `.git`). As git, Lima works when you're offline, so a local database is obviously needed to store locally the file awaiting to be transferred to the Lima when offline. The files you put into your Lima drive are stored locally *until* they are on the Lima, then they are purged and decrease the used memory of the local storage. You can think about this local database like a cache which contains your important files, or files which are not yet on your Lima. - Concerning the “insertion” of a database: It was always part of the product. How would it work offline without it? Lima implements a full file system. It is NOT a network file system like NFS, Samba. We are not a NAS. De facto, a file system needs a database to store the files. - Concerning the fact that Lima duplicates data: As said previously, it does not duplicate in the long term. It just stores the files to be transferred to the Lima. When done, the files are purged and the local memory is free-d. - Concerning our “own format”, a lot of programs you use daily use custom format database. The program to export the file from your local database has not been released yet but that's something we need to do and that will arrive in the near future. @Casey: I will double-check with the tech team before giving you an answer on this. So answer coming tomorrow. @Alistair: Cool, thanks for the heads up! @CK I understand that this is frustrating and I hope that the support team will come up with a solution very soon. @Adiplin thanks for the heads up! @Jerry Support should get back to you tomorrow regarding this if you’ve already sent an email. @BrianS: Changing hard drives and adding new drives is something on our roadmap yes. @Everyone: The much awaited version 0.10 was released today! You’ve normally received an email explaining you how to install it and what’s new. Here’s a recap of what you should do to get it if for some reasons you haven't received the email: - If you already have a version of Lima installed - For Mac users: 1. Quit the Lima app, 2. Download the new app from <url>’t compatible with Windows Phone at the moment, but no problem with your Nexus! Just go to install.meetlima.com from there. @Philipp Did you send an email to <email>? Let me know if they haven’t answered you by tomorrow and I’ll ping them again. @Joshua Thanks for the heads up! And yes, phandling repopulated hard drives is on our roadmap. @Brian You can use flash drives but it’s not as fast as with a regular USB drive and won’t work when unification is enabled (because it’ll be too small). @Casey With 0.10, that is not the case anymore. This feature makes sense when unification is enabled, but is painful with the Pioneer Kit, which is why we changed it in 0.10. @Eron @Yovan @Craig thanks for the heads up and your feedback! @Xanthos We need you to confirm your address, and you'll receive it right away! I've just sent you another email to confirm your address. Did you get it? (sent it to your hotmail.be address) @Fire sorry for this, it's not in our hands unfortunately. @Casey why don't you try with a real hard drive to see the difference? @AnnMarie: I confirm that you do not need any specific skills to use Lima at this point. If you run into any trouble during the installation, just send an email to <email> and they'll walk you through every step of the way. Why don't you give it a try? If anything seems weird or too complicated for you, don't hesitate to send me an email directly on <email> as I'd be very interested in hearing your feedback. For those wondering about Linux support, the CLI client is arriving very soon. You can get a preview here: <url>’ll be in touch ASAP. @Yahya If you need help, just send an email to <email> @Casey: It’s a bad idea to use a USB thumb drive as the technology used is different and the transfer speeds are far lower. You should use an external hard drive with Lima as was mentioned all along. @Sangwoo Sean Nam Indeed, the unification feature is missing as of now but we’re working hard to make it arrive ASAP. We’re still on target with September. @KC You did manage to get a refund though. @erick @Jerry @Victor: Shouldn’t have told you Monday sorry! The software update that changes this is more likely to arrive tomorrow, or Wednesday at worst. You’ll receive an email so you won’t miss it. @Jerry: As Johnny said (thanks!), just go on install.meetlima.com from your Android device and you’ll be able to download it! @Antoine: Thanks for the feedback! Enjoy :) @Richard Problem #1 should be solved by the next software update that is most likely to arrive on Monday. For problem #2 I’m not sure it’s a bug: as long as Lima needs to send stuff and that your device is powered on, it’s probably preventing the device from going to sleep. It’s sending the items you put in the Lima drive to the hard drive attached to Lima (shouldn’t take that long though). I’ll ping product on this to give your feedback. Do not hesitate to send bug reports when you run into some issues: that will enable developers to tackle the bugs faster. @Kristin Thanks for the detailed feedback. I’ve passed the info along to tech team and hope that this issue will be solved with the next software update that should arrive on Monday. We’ll keep you posted in our weekly updates here: <url>’ll receive an email when the next software update arrives with what it solves. @Pierre Carme: Did you contact support regarding this? They should be able to help you out (<email>) @c c Shen: Can you contact support explaining your issue? It’s very weird indeed if you have new folders appearing! What you should do: 1. send a bug report so that developers have the info about the bug, 2. send an email to <email> so that they can help you come out of this situation. @Lius: This should only be the case until your files have reached the hard drive on Lima. You shouldn’t need to have your computer on at all times of course! Did you check your “Lima preferences” to see if files were still sending? If that’s not the case, please send a bug report so that they can track this bug. @Tim: OK perfect. @Srinivasu Kota: These are things that we are working on. Please note that we will soon offer the possibility to back up your content with 2 Lima devices: we recommend putting the 2 Lima devices at two different locations and they will automatically back each other up at distance, just in case one of the hard drives fails. @Andrew: Thanks for your feedback! @Jannik As Merijn said, Lima is not compatible with El Capitan at the moment, but will be when it’s out of beta. @Roloff, Thorsten: Great, thanks for the heads up! @Ian Way to go :) @Tim Don’t hesitate to send bug reports when you have these types of problems. I’m not sure what you mean by working with it outside of your home network? You can already access your Lima files from outside. @Kyle: Thank you! @Srinivasu Kota: Thanks for your feedback. Note that you can’t share the files to outside users as of now. That feature will arrive later. @Daniel: There seems to have been some misunderstandings -> If you install Lima now, you'll be using the Pioneer Kit, which means you'll have a Lima drive appearing on your desktop computer, in which you'll be able to put files. -> As this is still a beta, we make clear during the installation process that you should only put backed-up files in the Lima drive to be extra-safe. That means you should COPY files into the Lima drive, and not MOVE them. Those files will appear in the Lima apps of your mobile devices, and in the Lima drive of your other computer if you have installed Lima on another computer. Additionally, the pictures and videos taken from your mobile devices will automatically be uploaded to Lima as well so you'll see them from all of your devices. -> "all my files will be renamed and will be unusable to me unless using the Lima software" => no! Your files will keep exactly the same names, and you can move them around in and out of the Lima drive on your computer without any problems. What people have been complaining about is the fact that if you *remove* the external hard drive attached to the Lima device, and plug it directly on your computer, you won't be able to read those files directly. That is indeed true but note that unplugging the hard drive attached to Lima isn't and has never been recommended: the Lima device needs the external hard drive to properly function. However, this isn't a final limitation: we store the files on the external hard drive in some internal format for efficiency as of now, but a software update will arrive soon to enable you to be able to read the files directly if you unplug the hard drive attached to Lima (Note that it still won't be recommended!) All in all, you can wait for new releases to arrive before installing your Lima (for instance wait for the external hard drive files to be readable if that reassures you), but know there's no risk to permanently lose files at this stage if you make sure to copy files in the Lima drive. The original file will remain safely on your device in case something goes wrong. To have more info about what you can do with the Pioneer Kit in its current version, you can check this out: <url>’ll keep you updated when this feature arrives. @Johnny This is really interesting. Did you send a bug report with this info? If you haven’t please do, it’s the best way to make sure our Windows developer fixes those bugs. @Terry Well, you have nice friends :) @Andrew: Thanks for your feedback. No, I’m afraid you can’t backup to a Cloud as of now. @John We’ve sent you an email. @Nicander Sorry about the VAT! Not much we can do about that :/ @John Spence: Thanks for your feedback! @David We’re glad too ;) @Everyone: please check our last tech update to see what we're working on and what you can expect in Lima 0.10 and 0.11 <url>’ll get you a replacement. Sorry for the trouble. @Nicolas Thanks for the heads up. @David: We’re now working on the Linux client so it should arrive soon. @Henrik Please send an email to <email> regarding this and they’ll be able to diagnose if there’s something wrong with your device, in which case we will replace it for you. @Mark Thanks for your feedback! As Coco Chanel said, fashion passes, style remains ;) @KC @Christopher Lewis: Oh, you mean some people who have actually received the device and are happily using it are astroturfers? But surely people who have never even touched the product and have been refunded are far more legitimate to talk about it? I’m sorry that you came to a point to which you’re so paranoid about us that everyone who disagrees with you is surely an astroturfer. I am, as it obviously means we’ve been doing some things wrong. But now that you’ve been refunded, maybe you can stop wasting your time on us if we’re that bad and let people enjoy the product without being insulted. - Penelope @Casey : I think your email was answered. @Truls Thanks for letting us know :) @Scott: Why don’t you send a bug report using the Lima app? Thanks. @Guilherme: Thanks for your feedback! Did you check out your dashboard? (Lima icon in your taskbar, “Lima preferences”) You have more info about which files are being transferred there. And sorry for the taxes, but it’s not something we have control over :/ @Lawrence Copying 250K files all at once was probably a bit too much for Lima, which is still in beta. Can you try copying a bit less files at a time? That should work. If it doesn't, please send a bug report using the app. @FE Sent you an email as well. @Mau Merci pour votre retour! @Michael @Leomaier @Gabriel @Daniel @gift of gab @works @clemens We've sent you an email. @Lee Chern, Thanks for the heads up :) @Alvin Please let us know what your questions are. @Johnny: You should install Lima after your Windows 10 update. You’ll be guided to install the Android app during the desktop installation or you can go to install.meetlima.com from your smartphone to get it (but need to have created an account on desktop first) @Showmecn You should have the first steps in the packaging, or you can go to install.meetlima.com directly. @Shn Can you send an email to <email> to help you out on this? @Paul Is there anything unclear? @Murphy Super! @Tommy, Thanks for the heads up! @Eduardo Our support team does its best :) @Luis Thanks for your feedback! Will let the Android developer know. @Charles Cool :) @Marc Thanks for your feedback and let us know if anything is unclear. @Scott If your power supply breaks, let us know and we’ll send you a new one. @Ian R: It’s really weird but I can’t find your address on Kickstarter. Can you please send me your Kickstarter email to <email> and I’ll confirm it for you? @Terry If you’ve received the email it’s perfect. Your Lima should arrive early next week. Lima will work on all your Mac/Windows PCs and Windows/iOS tablets for now. Linux support will arrive very soon but I can’t give you an exact date as of now. Some of our developers are already working on it in their spare time. Please note that you’re supposed to use Lima only for your personal usage for the moment, in view of the unification feature that arrives at Fall. @John: Thank you, we’ll make sure to update this ASAP. @Terry Mmmh, well you don't *need* a smartphone, but you need to have several devices or you wouldn't need Lima in the first place. Your order should leave the warehouse tomorrow morning. @Terry OK, I've confirmed it for you. @Anders Great! Here’s a little blogpost to help you choose: <url>’ll be able to put 2TB of data in the Lima drive (you choose which files) and access those 2TB of files from all of your other devices. Note that Lima is thought for a single person only. @John Can you tell me which webpage you’re referring to exactly? Unfortunately, we don’t have an exact schedule of the timing future features as of now. We were never too good at giving dates as you know :) @BravoJoe \o/ Thanks for your feedback and looking forward to the unification update too! @Marcus Just go to install.meetlima.com from your smartphone and you’ll be able to download the app without an SMS! @Pepe Sorry for this temporary issue that is now solved! To download the mobile app, just go to install.meetlima.com from your smartphone and log in to your Lima account. We’re still using Crashlytics to be able to push software updates faster and get easier feedback/bug reports from users for the moment. @Bjorn, Thanks for the heads up, let us know when you start using Lima! @Gertjo: Thanks for your feedback. To install the Lima app on your smartphone without the sms, just go to install.meetlima.com from your smartphone. @Hugo: Thanks for your feedback! @Gabriel: Users will have to switch to unification eventually but you’ll be the one making the change from one mode to the other. @Olivier We'll hope the replacement unit will provide you with a better experience. Customer care has been a bit under water, but they're getting better and better (experience!) and are now able to answer way faster than before. @Terry You haven't confirmed your shipping address yet so we can't send you your device yet. I've just sent back the email. Did you get it? It's your gmail address. @Aurelien thanks for your support :) we're glad the backers meetups enabled you to meet the team and see our determination! @Moe @Frans thanks for the heads up! @Elias @ronald Can you please send an email to <email> regarding this? They’ll be able to help you out. @Eduardo If you don’t have an empty hard drive, you can indeed wait for the software version update that will make it possible to plug an already-filled hard drive. @John The filesending feature has indeed been unprioritized to focus on Lima’s core features. We don’t have an exact schedule regarding this. Hey everyone, You can read our last tech update here: <url>’ll let you know when you’ll be able to add an already-filled hard drive and I’m sorry for the delay on this. Concerning your EU plug instead of a UK one, this is the first time that we have a case like this. We’ll send you a UK adapter right away and Customer care will follow up with you on this. @Vince I’m sorry if you had a bad experience so far, and I hope you’ll give Lima a new try with upcoming versions of the software. @Taylor: This isn’t normal as right clicking and setting the files to be online only should release some space. Can you please send a bug report? Note that with the next release 0.10, we’ll change this and the files won’t be kept offline by default (it’s really important when unification is activated, but is actually frustrating with the Pioneer Kit as you noticed.) More on that here: <url>’t support multi-user at this stage. You’re supposed to use it to share files with all of your own devices but not with other people. The reason behind this is that we’ll ultimately move to the “Unification feature” which will sync your entire computer, and you do not want to share your entire computer with other people. There will be a collaboration feature such as what you’re looking for, but not in the near future. Concerning the back up plan, the feature where you can have two Limas that back each other up will arrive very soon yes! @Clemens: We try to answer as many questions as possible, including negative ones, but it’s true that it’s sometimes hard to answer questions that have already been addressed multiple times or that don’t really expect an answer. Please tell us what you would like to know that you feel hasn’t been answered yet. @BrianS I confirm Customer care has received your message and they will get back to you as soon as possible. @njwringley Thank you for your honest feedback, and we'll look into this popup issue. I hope 0.10 or versions after than will make it better for you and that you'll give Lima an ultimate trial. @Amy We'll let you know when you can plug hard drive that are already filled in to Lima. @Steve the backup feature has the highest priority on our to-do list. We invite you to read our weekly update on the blog that details the latest progress <url>’re right that you need to plug an empty hard drive at the moment, but this will evolve in the next versions. @All: We’ve spent the week to finish Lima 0.9, which has been tested by a selected group of backers and was made available to all current beta testers on Thursday. We will post an update very soon with all the details and the shipping schedule. Have a great end of weekend! @David, @Matthieu, @Chris, @Irene & Richard, @Sandy: Thanks for the feedback @David: Yes, we're working on enabling you to setup Lima with a non-empty drive. Feature has been de-prioritized but is still on the roadmap. @KC: (About backup) You're right. Version control is coming. @Chris: Thx for your feedback. Your setup process seems unnormally long. Could you let us know which step took 20min, and which kind of HDD you were using for the setup (old one / new one + format)? @Irene & Richard: Beta period is still running, but things are improving fast. We'll let you know when we have more info about the multi-lima feature. It's one of our highest priorities right now. @Rob we’re sorry to hear our contact webform did not work for you. Do you mind writing us at <email> to let us know more about your issue (both the Lima setup fail and the non-working webform)? @Wayne: Did you register to the beta list? @BrianS: We do plan, in the Pioneer Kit, to turn off the feature keeping a local copy of files on computers by default. As mentionned in an earlier response: this feature makes a lot of sense for unification, but not at all in the Pioneer Kit. We’ll let you know when that happens (priority: high). Until then, keep in mind that you can remove the offline version of files in your computer by 1/ right-clicking on any file/folder; 2/ Selecting [Lima]-->[Remove offline version]. Tell us if that works for you! @Sandip the AppleTV is supposed to be compatible, could you please let us know with which device you’ve tried to play your videos from? Were using version 0.8.1 or version 0.9? Thanks! Regarding Chromecast: we’ve found the issue too. We’ll work on it. Thx for reporting! @Jean Luc you should see the Lima drive on your desktop or finder, so you only have to drag and drop the files you want into it. If you can’t see it, there is something wrong, the support will help you (<email>) Thanks @James for your support! @Jacques, it seems you have an issue with your HDD, could you please send an email to our customer support at <email> regarding this? @Audric, @L Christer, @Sandeep thanks for your support and your feedback!! @christopher, for Cameron’s shipment, the shipment took longer than it should (15 days). Our answer was not as well written as it should have been, we should have said that even if unfortunately there was a problem on our logistic partner side, we were working with our partner to minimize the logistic issues for the future, which we are. @Christopher, this feature is not yet available in the Pioneer Kit. For now, you have access to the files stored in your HDD but they are hidden and not organized as they appear in your devices. Thanks @Chris for your support! @Sandeep I've just sent you back your activation code. Sorry for the wait. @Venkat, please follow this link to get all the instruction you need to install the Lima app on your mobile: <url>’ve signed it, you have just to confirm your shipping address and we will send you your Lima right away! @Annette, Could you please explain your issue about Windows to our support at <email> ? They will help you solve that and properly install Lima! Hi @Justin, you’ll be able to update your address during your shipping process. Follow the link to start your shipping process if you want to join the Beta program: <url>"Remove offline version". This local copy makes a real sense when your computer has unification activated. It doesn't make much sense when in Pioneer Kit. We're currently thinking about disabling it for the Pioneer Kit. @Wayne: We’ll ship the devices of people who prefer not subscribing the Beta as soon as version 0.9 is stable. You can get more info on our last update: <url>’ll check it out with our mobile team. About UPNP, you can open a port manually if you wish. Here’s how (## Opening port 25211) <url>’ll be a desktop folder on the mobile apps that will show the same files as on the desktop of your computer(s). @J Thanks for your feedback. @Todd This feature has been de-prioritized until we get a stable version of Lima in the hands of all backers. It’s definitely still on the roadmap. @Daren: to receive yours, just sign up here and you’ll get it in a few days: <url>“Invitation to the Lima Beta Testing Program”? Just follow the steps and the Lima device will be in your hands in just a way days.” @Andrew: I checked it out and the problem was you actually put .com.com at the end of the email. I’ve changed it and you should receive an invitation within the next 24 hours. @Jochen, thanks for your feedback! Happy testing! @Sinnyc Our mailing address in the US is 2915 Ogletown Road #1837 Newark, DE 19713 USA and in France 10 rue de la Victoire, 75009 PARIS. @Stan thank you for your support! @Christopher: The Lima firmware is based on Linux and is compatible with hundreds of different hardware platforms. We didn’t re-write our firmware because of RAM chip change. We have trouble understanding where you got your information? @Sribeubeu: Inscrivez-vous à la beta et vous verrez bien que nous bossons effectivement sur quelque chose :) <url>’t declare them as gift, which would kind of be cheating. @Jonathan: Just register to the beta list and you’ll receive your Lima device in a few days: <url>’ve received (same email that the one in which you have your beta key). As explained by Merijn, you need to test first with an empty HDD. Thanks @Boris for your quick message. @Raul: Mass shipping is scheduled for the next weeks, as explained yesterday in the microupdate we’re posting every week (<url>’re not increasing the shipping pace until we get that part done. @Casey as indicated yesterday, we want to drop the NDA once debug information have been removed from the product, which should be done soon. We expect this around the release of Lima 0.9, which will be the version right after 0.8.1 (which should be available by the end of the week). You will be informed in an update. @Paulo, @Markus, @Sujith, @Tim, @Ralph, @Marius, @Nathanael, @Golia, @Jon, @Russell, as always, thanks for taking time to share your first impressions. @Everyone, we've just published our latest tech update on the blog where we tell you what's been happening over the past week in the tech team: <url>’ll need to adapt the back-up plan feature to the new firmware before enabling you to use a second Lima device to back up the first one. This important feature will come a bit later than we thought, and will be available a few weeks after we ship you all the devices. @Frank: thanks for raising those points. Christophe from the support team has sent you a direct email in order to run further investigations and identify your issues. @Alex: 0.8.1 is on the way. It will be released this week. Should be easier to install on Windows 7. We’d be glad to have your feedback. @Sandy: If you’re stuck somewhere during the installation, you can contact directly our Support Team at <email>. Please take time to describe as precisely as possible the issue you encounter. Do not hesitate to attach screenshots to your message. It will help our Team to understand better what’s going on. @David. Thanks for taking time to report the bugs to the team, we received them well. Last update was 3 weeks ago. Next update coming in the middle of this week. You should get a better experience with the new release. Else, we’d be glad to work with you on these problems. @terry we want to drop the NDA once the debug information have been removed from the product, which should be done soon. We expect this around the release of Lima 0.9, which will be the version right after 0.8.1. You will be informed in an update. For Linux, as previously said, we will do it post shipping, once the other platforms are stable. @Nicholas, thank you for informing us about this, it doesn’t sound normal. We’re currently investigating and we will get back to you. @Lorenzo, we invite you to read the weekly updates posted on the blog to follow the latest developments, they’re written for all backers, and not only for beta testers. The last one is here: <url>"cost of legacy"), or why a company like DropBox can take an entire year only to release a feature to share files via a link. On a much smaller scale, our tests at Lima after the campaign showed us that our software had to be modified to be as robust as we wished. It's not something we had anticipated to be blocking before the campaign, but we figured out later on that our first technical choices wouldn't work as well as anticipated on the field. And that's the reality of projects under development: you discover problems in the middle. It can happens and it does happen now and then. Because yes, shit happens. What we discovered was that pursuing development with the technical base we had at the time would have implied shipping a buggy product, very difficult to maintain & to improve. Our F1 needed a better engine to do the race. So we did like most project managers would do: we decided to solve the problem. We rebuilt our engine (the core) in C with all the learnings we had made from our tests & our first version and all the code "porting" we could do. And we went on to build a Lima that would be properly functional, because that's what we promised to do during the campaign. At this time, we estimated this tech-base change to induce a 4 month delay in the development of the project. The reason we suffered from much more delays is another question: we simply faced more problems than anticipated in the development of the project, as explained via our updates. @Christopher: >> Why was CGC company formed using KS money which was direct violation of KS terms? Our company CGC is handling this Kickstarter campaign. It wasn’t formed using KS money. You cannot run a KS campaign as a company if your company hasn’t been formed. We have trouble understanding your logic here. Where do you take your information from? >> Why throw away 2 years of coding and starting again? See answer to your first question. >> Does Lima gather meta data? Yes. The Lima app gathers metadata from external services (Gracenote, TMDB) about your files, to improve your experience on the mobile app (you can disable this in our app). None of your files is uploaded to these external services in the process. Our company doesn’t gather any of these metadata. The Lima app contacts the external services directly. >> When data has to be routed through your servers is any data being gathered (file traffic should be encrypted but other data can be gathered)? No. >> Are there any security holes in the device seeing how it tries to switch on UPNP by default it worries me that other security issues are being hidden No. There’s not point in purposedly building a product with security holes. For your information, Lima is only using UPnP to ask your router to open an external port from inside your LAN, which is pretty standard in the industry and is not a security flaw. Our device doesn’t use UPnP in any other way and is not impacted by security flaws related to UPnP. >> Servers that route data, where are they based? have they been through penetration testing? We use Amazon instances as relay servers. They are geographically distributed around the globe (US, Europe, Asia). They have not been through penetration testing but the data they transport is encrypted end-to-end. >> Has coding been through 3rd party audit? No. Audit will only really make sense on a stable product. >> Which escrew company is holding the data needed should cgc go under and we need other routes? None. Why do you think we would need an ecrew company for? @Todd, we're sorry to hear you feel like this about our company. A lot of your statements seem to originate from misinterpretations in this thread and are either not accurate or not true. No matter how hard you believe in them, CGC is indeed a US company and it's difficult to argue that the products we ship every 15 minutes now are fundamentally different from what you backed. These are simply facts. If you're interested to check them, we invite you to register the the Beta to receive your reward to verify it by yourself. We'd be glad to get your feedback and to work with you to make Lima match your expectations. @Zied, @Jordan, @Sandy, @Jose, @Louis-Bassett, @Timo, @Bill, @Tim: Thanks for your feedback! @Gianluca: Thanks for your feedback. Linux version will come post-shipping, but it's definitely still on the roadmap. What distro do you use? @Daniel: Lima 0.8.1 for Windows is coming up soon. We'd be interested to see if it works on your Windows 8.1 computer. Let's stay in touch! @Evangelos, @Steve and @David Thank you for your feedback. @Andry A 0.8.1 release in the works for the beginning of next week (the QA team is currently testing it). We’ll give you more info on Monday in our weekly tech update. Don’t hesitate to check out the last one here: <url>’m sorry your experience with Lima is not yet as good as it should be. The AMA on reddit is a great idea and we will definitely think about it. @Kopikao, copying a huge quantity of files can “freeze” Lima at this point. It’s a bug we’re aware of: this is what the core team is working on right now with the refactoring of the Lima firmware. In the meantime, we recommend you to copy only small quantities of files at once. @Mitch We’re sorry but as you said, they only dropped them last week. Compatibility will be managed asap. @Maxwell, it seems that you haven’t signed the Beta testing agreement yet. That’s why your shipping process hasn’t started. Just look for the email “Invitation to the Lima Beta Testing Program” in your inbox and follow the steps to start the shipping process. @Provost, thanks for your feedback. We are currently working on that. Thanks @Ricardo, @Adam, @Hal @Carlos, @Marie-Louis, @john and @David for your feedback and your support. Welcome on board! Hi @Annette, for now, as @Merijn said it’s better to copy your files into the Lima folder while we are in beta. You can copy your entire music library in the Music folder of your Lima drive which will allow you to listen to all your music on the go through the mobile app. However, if your music library is huge, it’s better to not copy it entirely at once because of a current bug which compromises the copy process for a very large amount of files. So it’s currently better to copy your library little by little until the next releases. @Andry And we are very pleased that you’re helping us build Lima. We need your feedback (from all the beta testers) to help us take the right decisions on the product development. We heard your concern about the DLNA integration but we have to focus on the stability right now. Once the beta tests will be completed, we will have time to start working on that. @Andry Thanks for your feedback. Having a LED on the device itself is definitely something we will do in future versions of the product, as we saw it's more convenient indeed. Concerning subtitles, it should work if you have the SRT file in the same directory as the movie file with exactly the same name. Is it the case for you? If it is and still not working, can you please send a bug report? Concerning DLNA, we had to delay it post-shipping to focus on the core functionalities of Lima first, but it's already compatible with Chromecast and Apple TV. What's your setup? @Rafael When you sign up for the beta, you receive the final Lima hardware, and you keep getting software updates during and after the beta phase. Whether you start in beta or not, you'll always have the latest software available and the same product in the end. @Terence Thank you for sharing! @Paul, @Jerome: thanks for the feedback! @Provost We’re glad you decided to give it a spin. Happy to get your feedback after your first tests. @Martin: The idea of doing a Beta is to work hand-in-hand with you to help solve the issues you face when installing Lima on your devices. It’ll help us make Lima ready-to-ship faster, and help you get the awesome product you expect & deserve. Too bad you faced so much trouble on Windows. Good news though: as mentioned in our update, other beta testers have pointed out the issues and have worked with us since last week to help us solve them. Windows version 0.8.1 is on the way. Regarding Android, are you testing with the last version released on Friday (0.8.1)? It should solve most your issues too. Else, we’d be glad to get more info on the phone your using. @Joshua: we’ll send you an email to confirm your shipping address (and modify it) right before sending you your Lima. It’s the best way to do it. @Ikalios: We’d love to get more info on the use cases you wanted to explore with Lima. Not sure we’re so far from what you expect, even if we’re still in Beta. Have you registered to receive the product in Beta and try it out? @Andrew: We decided not to support using a NAS instead of a USB Hard drive for Lima storage as unfortunately it would imply reliability & security issues (because it would mean replacing our USB connection by a networ connection full of unknown). The idea has been poking us for a long time though, and we’re still thinking about we can integrate NAS devices in the Lima workflow. Setting the Lima to backup to the NAS is definitely something we will explore post-shipping. OK @Rodolfo, you’ll receive an email soon from our customer support. @Christopher: You need to open TCP, TCP port 25211. Tell us if you need anything else. @Nahum, could you please send an email to our support at this address <email>? We can’t deal all the individual issues on this wall, but it’s interesting for us to get more details on the issues you get & to troubleshoot them with you. Hi @Mark, Thanks for your feedback. Multiple hard drives support is indeed on the roadmap but will not be integrated during the Beta. We’ll let you know! @Andry: Don’t worry, you’re signature seems very real & legit, and doesn’t look at all like a dickbutt. Thanks @Merijn, @I&R, @Neumeier, @Benjamin, @Chad, @Alejandro and @Rodolfo for your feedback. Please continue to share your experience with Lima here. @Nimrod, @Andry this is just the beginning. We wish you’ll enjoy your Lima. @Rodolfo, We are very sorry your experience with Lima was a pain. We are very interested in your feedback. We’re currently working with the beta testers to solve most of the issues you've faced here, but each configuration/experience is different and the more info we get the better. Could we ask you some questions about your devices and your testing environment directly by email? @KokLeong, follow @Merijn, he’s right ;) Hi @henrik, you can report your bug on the Lima menu (to open it you have to click on the Lima icon on the status bar on Mac / right click on the Lima icon of the systray on Windows). Than click on “Report issue”. @Nathan thanks for reporting the bugs you’re facing via the Lima app, they’re used by the developers to correct them. If you need assistance and customized feedback, it’s better to send an email to the customer service (what you did yesterday afternoon). @Kjell, we recommend you to put offline the files which are already on your Lima drive to free up some of your computer local storage. @Everyone Don't forget that you can check our tech progress in our weekly update. The last one, published last Monday, is here: <url>’s the best way to get your Lima device as early as possible. We’re doing everything we can to be able to increase our shipping pace very soon. @Gabrielle, @min, @darren, @Kjell, thanks for sharing some words after receiving your Lima! @Kjell, we confirm what has been said by Christopher earlier. You need to plug a single empty HDD at this stage. Support for multiple HDDs will be added later on after the beta phase. 6000th comment! yay! @Timo you will be able to join the beta program in about a week. Once you’ve received the email, just follow the different steps. Once your shipping address is confirmed, you will get a tracking number to follow your parcel. @Everyone Don't forget that you can check our tech progress in our weekly update. The last one, published yesterday, is here: <url>’re currently thinking about and we would like to open such a forum once the BTA is lifted. At this stage, we collect all the questions and bug reports through our customer service. When necessary, we add information in our FAQ : <url>’t pay any import duties and VAT. 3- I confirm you UK power adapter are available, and I confirm you it’s what you have selected already. @Os since you encounter difficulties when testing Lima, we encourage you to contact the customer service (<email>) to receive assistance. @Nicolas, @Benjamin: To receive your Lima device, you can jump into the beta program whenever you like, please register here: <url>été transmis. Vous avez normalement reçu un email vendredi dernier pour vous prévenir qu'il y avait une nouvelle version : il faut l'installer et voir si vos problèmes sont persistants. @Espen: Thanks for testing on a Jolla! It's great to know Lima works well on Sailfish :) @Patrik, @Christopher: For clarification, this is a US-based Kickstarter campaign. Our company CGC is a US company, and so is Kickstarter. So European law may not apply here. There's nothing to fear about the warranty of Lima mentionned in our Beta tester agreement. What we're actualy doing is that we're giving you an *additional* half a year of commercial warranty when you Beta test the product. The warranty we apply to your rewards are an additional protection for you. It cannot lower or replace other guarantees given by the law. It's just an additional commitment from us to ensure that you'll get a properly working Lima. If you read in details, the European text you refer too make the distinction between commercial 'warranty' and the European 'guarantee' it in its second subpart ("Additional guarantees"). For the little story, in Europe most consumer-electronics companies offer only a 1-year commercial warranty. It offers clients an additional warranty for one year, but their products are also covered by the European 2-years guarantee (which often offers other, less-advantageous terms). Does that make more sense now? @Levvy: Lima only handles empty hard drives for the moment, as mentionned in our install wizard. You're data is actually still in your USB hard drive, but you just cannot see it through Lima. You can get it back easliy by unplugging your hard drive from Lima and plugging the drive back to your computer. @Brenna: Did you register to our Beta list? <url>"Sign the agreement" and you need to click on it. Do you see it? Maybe you should enable images on your email, even though it's supposed to be a button so appear in all cases. @rafael If you sign up to the Beta, you will receive the final Lima device, and will have 6 extra months of warranty, which sums up to a year and a half of warranty. It's not the hardware, but the software that is currently in Beta. You will then start with a beta version of the software, and get updates all along the way which will eventually lead to a non-beta version of the Lima software. @Jonas @Herman Thanks for keeping us informed! @All Beta testers. The new release is out! Check your emails. @Aaron: when installing this new version, you’ll be guided to install the mobile apps through text message. If you need help, read this: <url>’re on the beta list, and you get in the shipping process in about three days according to your number on our list. @all current beta testers: a new software release arrives tomorrow and I’m sure you’ll like it :) @Relle @Matan @maurizio @noelix Thank you for your feedback! @Sandip We are looking into it and are sorry for the delay of our logistic partner. @Matan You can already backup photos and video directly from your iPhone. a new release arrives tomorrow to make that process even faster. @ozymandias: Sorry for the email you just received. This wasn’t an official answer from Lima: this was an email from one of our employees who lost his temper. Some people in our team have difficulties tampering with receiving emails from you every day, and feel harassed. Of course, this was completely inappropriate and we deeply apologize for his behavior. @All: If you haven't seen it yet, the weekly update on our tech progress is here: <url>"talk through the Amazon Cloud". They establish a VPN and use it to talk to one another. In most cases, this VPN uses direct connection between devices (P2P). When no direct link is available (for instance: devices are behind NATs with no UPnP / open ports), as a fallback, the encrypted trafic is routed through relay nodes (proxies that are hosted on AWS) we provide to ensure your Lima can work properly. This traffic is encrypted end-to-end with SSL, with a per-user key we do not have access to, so even then we cannot access your data. To the few users confronted to this issue, you have to go in the admin interface of your router and active UPnP. Once that's done, UPnP will open a secure port allowing your devices to communicate directly with each other through VPN. If you have more question on how to do this, do not hesitate to send it to <email> and they'll help you out on this (They try to answer as fast as possible, but for trickier questions such as yours, it might take a bit longer than the average 8 hours as they have to ask developers) @Claes, we have not tested Lima with all the HDDs yet, it should be compatible with this one. @everyone, do not forget to take a look at our latest weekly update to be aware of everything we've done in the past week: <url>’s happening on a weekly basis, you can check our blog to get the latest news on debugging. Last week, we invited 200+ beta testers, pushing the beta group to 500+ people. We've been working on ejecting a drive, on the status of the syncing process and on critical bugs. See more on the blogpost <url>ɐuɹɐ Lechevalier: We've postponed this feature to stabilize the product & thus ship you faster, but it's definitely on the roadmap. We won't let you down on this one. @Amy Daley: For clarification, we won't require you to sign a NDA to send you your reward. You'll just need to do it if you want to participate to the beta test and help us stabilize the Lima apps. @TC, @BrianS: Linux version is still on the roadmap, of course. We just need to focus on Windows & Mac first to ship the majority of backers as soon as possible. @BrianS Some of our developers use Apple computers because its a prerequisite to develop well for MacOS or iOS. It doesn't prevent them from developping for other platforms. @TC: The Lima app will only store data on one HDD of your computer (you can choose which one). If you have multiple HDDs on your computer, they'll stay accessible. Their content just won't be accessible from your other devices. @Brian We plan to start shipping Lima devices to people who weren't in the beta list next week. The Lima will still be in beta though. We'll ship progressively, starting by sending one Lima device every hour. We will increase the shipping pace as soon as possible, and everyone will have received their Lima devices by the end of June. @Lorenzo: We’ll never force you to sign an NDA. You’ll have to sign a beta testing agreement if you want to receive your Lima in the next few weeks. If you don’t want to do that, that’s perfectly fine and we’ll send you your device once the beta testing agreement is lift, which will be by the end of June at worst. Note that you’ll be able to use the product right away using the Pioneer Kit version. If you’re unsure about the difference between the Pioneer Kit and the full unification version that will arrive in September, check out this page : <url>’t want to sign a beta testing agreement will receive their Lima devices as soon as we don’t need the beta testing agreement anymore. I can’t give you an exact date as we don’t know when the product will be stable enough to remove debug infos from it, but that will be in all cases before the end of June, as we’ll ship all backers by then. @Christopher Lewis: There seems to have been a misunderstanding on the reduced hardware warranty so we’re going to rewrite that part in the beta tester agreement: people who beta test the Lima device actually have 6 *extra* months of warranty, in addition to the one year warranty provided for the rewards of backers. So if you choose to receive your Lima device in beta test, you’ll have one year and a half of warranty. @TC: Lima’s core technology was developed on Linux: that means that everything is *already* coded for Linux except for the UI. @Lorenzo: Sorry. It's hard to find questions in this thread. > When are you going to deliver Limas to non beta testers? We'll begin shipping people that are not on the beta list next week. The product will still be in Beta. So technically, these people will still be Beta testers, and will still need to sign an NDA. NDA will be dropped as soon as the product is stable enough to remove debug infos from it. We then plan to intensify the shipping rate progressively so everyone can get his/her Lima by the end of June. > When will be Linux support be ready? We don't see that before the end of summer. We'll only work back on Linux after everyone is shipped and after we have spent the necessary time checking Lima works right for most of you. However, the core was developed on Linux, so finishing to develop a first Linux version should be quick and our developers are very eager to work on it. @Rey Espinueva, @Max Metz, @Ozymandias, @KC, @TaylorWatson, @Derya, @Chris Lewis, @TC, @IanR, @Brandon Williams, @Geert, @Dongjin Kim, @Keith Anderson, @Kjell Provost, @Brian Carter, @kokobin, @Ikalios, @Casey Allen, @John, @Michael. We definitely hear you. As mentioned earlier, we cannot provide refunds at this stage. Funds were already used to produce the Lima devices corresponding to your rewards. We understand your frustration. We understand how huge the delays have been since the first estimated shipping date. But the best and only thing we can do today is continue working on the project to ship you the best product possible. As you know, the technology behind Lima is unique and very challenging to build. We faced some bumps on the road, but we are finally coming to the end. - 500 beta testers are in the Beta program as we speak, - more backers will be able to join the beta and discover the Lima experience by the end of the month - all the backers’ Lima devices have been produced and are in our US and European warehouses ready to be shipped to your home, once we give a go. We will keep you updated as often as possible on Kickstarter and on our blog. Thanks for your patience. Thank you @Ian, @Tedd @Michael, @John, @Kane @Thomas @Olivier for sharing your feedback about the Lima hardware and the beta program. @All We indeed encourage beta testers to come here and comment on their experience. A new update will be posted early next week with the progress of beta tests and information about increasing shipping pace. @ozymandias Hello, this is Penelope talking. I was in the room with Severin during your conversation, so I heard what you were asking and what he answered. I can’t remember him saying “small people” or “small backers”. If he did - which I doubt - he surely didn’t mean it in a despising way as you seem to be suggesting. If Severin despised backers, he wouldn’t have spent an hour trying to explain you why it wasn’t possible to refund backers, as the funds were used for manufacturing the Lima devices you backed. What he did repeat over and over again, was that the project didn’t change. There seems to have been a misunderstanding concerning the Lima apps. As he tried to explain you, the Lima app is completely transparent on desktop, which makes it very different from Dropbox, but still requires a visible app on mobile, as shown in the Kickstarter description (Mobile section: "On your smartphone and your tablet, the Lima app will enable you to browse all of your files from everywhere”). And he did mention that you’ll be able to use Lima storage from other apps. All in all, I agree with you that the conversation wasn't very constructive, but I hope you’ve understood that our whole team remains fully dedicated to bringing you the best device possible, answering the project’s specifications, and that we’re all working very hard to achieve this. We’re almost there, and we’ll provide you with more info on the beta tests and shipping next week. Hey everyone, A new update is coming next week with some news about shipping. Additional beta testers have been invited (adding up to 300 in total). We hope that some of them will comment here to let you know who’s testing. Have a great week-end. @Pablo, @Peter we have started a new beta program in December, and by the end of this month, 300+ backers will have joined the program to help us stabilize the Lima software. From mid-April we will start to gradually ship more and more backers, we will bring more details in the next updates. You will get your Lima soon! Quick update: the Windows application is now live for beta tests. Previous beta testers and group Bangkok are starting to test as we speak. More info here: <url>’t worry, we will individually confirm your address before shipping, just as we’re doing with beta testers. @Ozymandias All backers are welcome to contact us anytime by sending an email to <email>. We answer all genuine emails, usually within 24 hours. Concerning your specific case, I’m afraid you have already emailed us more than 60 times asking the same questions over and over again. Christophe has repeatedly answered your questions, but after more than 20 answers that you do not seem to want to hear, he’s spending his time with people who have real questions. Let me remind you that we have also offered you to call you, or Skype you, but that you declined this offer. If you change your mind on this, do not hesitate to let us know. @David: I confirm that the Kickstarter money was spent in the production and development process (except for the shipping fees). All the hardware devices are ready and waiting to be shipped from our warehouses in the US and in Europe. As soon as the software is stable enough, we’ll roll out to all backers. The shipping fees remain untouched, as we haven’t shipped yet and are keeping that money to do so. @Stan: We’re still testing as this stage, as we’re only shipping backers who are part of the beta testing program. Concerning colors, you have chosen your color already on your backer dashboard. If you’d like to change, please send an email to <email>. @Joshua: we'll send you an e-mail to confirm your address right before shipping. You'll be able to change it then. @ozymandias and @Joseph, Linux is still on our roadmap. But we need now to focus on Windows to improve the performance and the stability of the app. We plan to develop the Linux client once the Mac and Windows will be more stable. @ozymandias: We haven’t changed the original project. What do you see different in the Android app? @Edson, we are currently performing private beta tests with selected backers. We plan to begin shipping gradually to the rest of the backers from mid-April. @David Unfortunately we can't refund your pledge as, as initially planned, funds were used for production and development process. As you may know, when you fund a project on Kickstarter, you’re not buying something, you’re helping a project to become a reality. And in return to your help you are rewarded. When you pre-order on our website you make a purchase, that’s different. So, as usual when you make a purchase you can be refunded. @Gio I confirm you that our goal is still to start shipping Lima to all our backers (outside of beta testers) in April. You’ll receive the Pioneer Kit which will evolve to the full Lima experience later in 2015 as we explained in the last update. The retail price will be $149 once people are able to order Lima directly without having to wait to receive it. The shipping date on our website concerns people who pre-order now, which isn’t your case as you backed the project on Kickstarter and will therefore receive it first. Regarding your question on update 36: yes, as mentioned during the campaign, we plan to add an “expert mode” to Lima enabling you to see a L: virtual drive in your system. Any folder you will place in this drive will be synced between your machines. You’ll be able to sync your files with very long paths by placing them at the root of this L: partition. @Merijn @Keith It will be possible to disable the metadata fetch feature if you don’t want to use it. We use Gracenote to find the metadata that improves the experience by enhancing your files data. During this process, your files’ content isn’t shared with Gracenote, and the connection to this service is anonymous. Concerning your second point, the development of metadata features has been handled by a separate developer from our team and didn’t have any impact on the shipping date. Hey guys, We've activated a great feature in the Pioneer Kit this week: movie recognition. Here's a little video to show you: <url>’s a fine line, but we’re happy with the first Beta results and that’s a good sign. @Christopher: Lima’s Unification technology only takes into account the folders in your user folder. So if you store something in the root of C:/ that will not be synchronized. Currently Lima’s technology is installed onto the drive where your system is. We’re working on making it possible to select the hard drive on which Lima stores data. @ozymandias: We explained in the project description (which can’t be changed after the campaign) that you don’t need an app for computers, whereas you do for mobile devices. You can even see a picture of what the app could look like entitled “Watch your movies anywhere // With the Lima app, stream your content on any device’ (Note that the design has evolved since). @Brandon: Thanks for your support! Leaving Lima on the Pioneer Kit is only temporary. The whole point of Lima is that you don’t have to think about synchronizing your files (which you still have to do with the Pioneer Kit, as you have to manually move the files into the Lima drive on your computer). So the concept of the Pioneer Kit is just there until we are sure Unification can safely manage all of your files. Can I ask you why you would prefer just to keep the Lima drive? @Merijn: The back-up plan will be included when Lima will begin general shipping in April. All you’ll have to do in this case is install your first Lima and then add the second one after that. @Andrew: 1. We currently use a server to serve as a relay only when communication between your devices or with Lima cannot be established by any other means. Even when using a relay, all communications are encrypted end-to-end. We’re planning to add settings options enabling you to control how the Lima connects to the outside World. 2. As of today, backup to NAS isn’t supported, but you can use free tools like CrashPlan to backup your data automatically from Lima to a NAS. Hope Lima will soon replace your Plex server & apps! 3. Lima enables you to access data “as normal” on your computer, directly via the File Explorer or via your apps. However, mobile devices don’t really have a File Explorer by default and don’t really use a file & folders paradigm to organize your content. So we created an app that works like a File Explorer to enable you to browse & access your files. Our app gathers any pictures & video you take on mobile to make them available to your other devices. We’re also working on features so you can save files in Lima by “Sharing” content from other apps. 4. You will indeed need to install a software to use Lima: an app for each one of your devices. These apps are a huge part of the product and Lima’s hardware cannot be used without them. 4bis: The Kickstarter funds are being used to fullfil our promise to backers. For each ~69$ backed, we’re currently producing a Lima device - as announced in our campaign. The $1,229,074 help us fund the production of 15788 devices. The costs attached to this production are split between hardware production (nre, electronics, plastic, auxiliary parts), software production and shipping. The biggest part of our software development costs is the cost of the team. You can count 15 people working on the product itself in our team. 5 other people work on customer care, overall management & marketing. Kickstarter funds support production and shipping to backers. Part of the software production costs and costs to build & grow our company are supported via external funding. @Cyril: There is a list of beta testers. Those who weren’t selected to be on the beta list were notified. About 100 beta users have been invited to receive the device and test the apps in January. More to come this month. @fmotta: Actually, the hardware spec hasn’t changed since the Kickstarter. Only the plastic casing was re-worked. The Lima you’ll receive is the one described in our Kickstarter page, even if we had to make serious changes in the software internals during the way to improve its performance, maintainability & stability. @Timo: Sure, it’s still happening. To keep you up to date, the project suffered from several delays due to bumps in software development (you can get more info through our KS updates). The good news is we’ve made a lot of progress and are currently running beta tests with the first backers. We’re about to add even more. As we progress through the tests we’ll add more beta testers and will ship all backers when Lima is more stable. For clarification, some people seem to think that the project has changed. We confirm it hasn’t, the project we’re working on is still the one described on the project description page, except for the plastic casing of the hardware which was improved post campaign. We understand how frustrating it can be to wait for the project to ship. It’s already been a year and a half since the end of the campaign. However be sure that our enthusiasm and our commitment to deliver your Lima are intact. We’re now testing the product with some of you on the field and we’re very close to delivering to more beta testers. We are living a very exciting moment of this project and we’re very close to getting the Lima devices to your hands. @Sean: When we opened signups for the beta we had 800 people to sign up and were able to select 500 who were eligible to test. Those 500 were divided into different groups to which we are gradually rolling out. We opened up our private beta to 100 beta testers and we’re about to include more groups in the tests. Currently the beta testers are limited in how much they can disclose about what they are testing. We know it’s frustrating not to be able to get more information from the beta testers. As we roll out to more groups this limitation will be removed and we hope more of them will share their experience here. @Noelix we can’t guarantee you’ll be in the beta test group (we have already 500+ people registered), yet you can send your details (devices used and OS versions, tech level) to Christophe (<email>) and we will see if we can include you in one of the groups in the future. @Hans: Transporter is a NAS device. You can read the difference with Lima in our campaign’s FAQ: <url>#project_faq_62136 Long story short: whereas Transporter will create only a single folder on your computer, Lima will synchronize every folder on your computer meaning you don’t have to think about moving files into one specific folder. @Haemophilic: As stated in the campaign, the Lima device hardware is based on the Wanser-R, a commodity device produced by MRT Communications.We’ve changed some components of the Wanser-R, so it meets Lima's performance requirements. The firmware, which gives its main functions to the device, is fully reprogrammed. The main innovation of Lima relies in the software used by Lima, not the hardware. @fmotta: We feel that the lack of device’s internal storage remains an important frustration for a lot of people. And we agree with you that more and more people prefer to go for lighter devices such as Mac Air or Surface. With a 2TB hard-drive plugged to Lima, even a small device can feel as if it has 2TB of storage. @ozymandias, @keith: The earphones are included with all Lima devices and are supporting the idea that with Lima all your devices will contain your *entire* music library, whatever their size & brand. @Keith: We announced in Update #5 that Lima was compatible with Google Chromecast. I confirm you that this feature is already implemented and is currently tested by beta testers. There is no mention of free Chromecast devices though. For everyone wondering about the packaging, each Lima has headphones but only beta testers receive a T-shirt with their Lima. More information about the beta is coming soon. We are currently preparing an update that should be up finished soon and will give you more information about our progress and the next steps. @Merijn: There is still a server that is being used for communications outside of your local network when a direct communication with your Lima cannot be established. It is still the plan that this will be removed in the future. @Benoit: Your Kickstarter reward is indeed late compared to the initial schedule, yet the plan is still to deliver your reward as soon as possible. The beta test program is currently running with 100 backers, and it helps us get a better idea of when we will ship the rest of our backers. An update is coming soon. Hey everyone, A quick update to debrief you about where we are. - Severin and the marketing team came back from the CES. It was a very interesting event, which also enabled us to meet a lot of backers. We met 5 backers at our meetup on Monday and a bit more than 30 backers at our booth during CES (including the founder of Pebble!). It was great to hear their support and enthusiasm, and we listened with attention to their feedback. @Robert: There seems to have been a misunderstanding between you and Severin. We knew that there would have to be an upgrade of the software some day, but that didn’t mean we thought our software wasn’t yet ready for consumers. It was only after auditing our code after the campaign that we realized it would be impossible to support the early version of Lima for 17 000 devices while simultaneously upgrading the software for everyone. Concerning the demo, we can’t remember for sure as we met and demoed Lima numerous times over CES. It’s very unlucky if you saw the demo crash as we were pretty happy with it during the four days. Is it possible that you left before we could give it another try? - On the product side, the technical team hasn’t been out of work while we were in Las Vegas. As planned, we released the Pioneer Kit’s Beta on Monday, and 52 beta testers have already started reporting bugs and providing feedback. Monday was a pretty intense day, but we’re really happy with the start of this new wave of tests, and will tell you more about it as soon as we have meaningful insights about the performance of the software. You can find pics and more info here: <url>’ve seen a lot of fantasizing about the fact that our project has changed since the Kickstarter campaign. It hasn’t: the Kickstarter page isn’t editable, and we’ve never said Lima was ‘just a personal DropBox’ or anything alike. We said it was the “brain of your devices”, and as we stated in the FAQ: “The main innovation in Lima is that it manages all of your data for you. Not only the contents of a specific folder. The Lima app replaces the entire file system of your computers. It handles everything: from the pictures in your "My Pictures" folder, to the files on your Desktop. So it really does feel like all your devices have the same memory: you can download something on your Mac, and open it on your PC. Everything is in Lima, and the Lima app makes synchronization invisible to you.” We don’t understand why there is a confusion on that point: we’ve always been building the project you backed on Kickstarter and we’ve never changed the scope of it. * This week has been a big milestone for us. We remain totally focused on debugging Lima’s software with our current beta testers, and hope to be able to make the beta group bigger as soon as possible. Our number one priority is on shipping and we’re nearly there. Quick update for everyone: So far 50 people have confirmed their participation as beta testers. We’re still waiting for the remaining to confirm their participation. After a tester signs his NDA, his device is sent out to him. With the CES coming up fast, we will be holding a meetup for all Las Vegas based backers or any out of town backers who will be in Vegas for the CES. The meetup will be held at 5pm on Monday January 5th in Spring Valley, about 2 miles away from the strip. We will send a registration link soon. @Merijn: We haven’t replaced any video, so I don’t see what you mean? The install video is still in update 33. It’s hosted on Vimeo so that we can give you the best possible video resolution. Once you publish a Kickstarter update it’s impossible to edit it after 30 minutes, so no video could ever have been replaced. We will post the NDA publicly as soon as the 100 beta testers have signed it. They can publicly confirm their participation and the fact that they have received their Lima (+ post picture of the Lima device). @Ozymandias: You were told that you were put on a waiting list for the beta. This does not mean that you are part of the 100 beta testers that are part of the beta right now. Please note that there are a lot of backers who followed the normal process this Summer, and who are before you in line. The other option we gave you was to receive the hardware without any software until the release for all Kickstarter backers but you rejected this. @ErikH: When using Lima you will see that all of your user files will be synced automatically wherever you save them. It means that even a document that is on your desktop will be stored on the hard drive attached to Lima, and thus available from your other devices. NAS devices (like Transporter) provide a specific drive into which you have to put your files if you want to make them available across your devices. On your mobile devices you will be able to open media content, such as movies or music, just by streaming them so that they don’t take up any space on your phone. The Lima app won’t force you to download the files before opening them. Hi there, As we said on Twitter yesterday the week has been very intense and we won't be able to shoot an update this week. The team is 100% focused on shipping the first betas this month. Sorry to make you wait for the beta details. We'll do our best to update you in the next few days. @Gio: An update, with more information about beta tests and shipping, is coming this week. @Alex: We replied to your e-mail on October 29th but it might have gone into your spam. We sent you another e-mail and a Kickstarter message today. @Christopher: The 100 beta testers will be selected from the list of those who signed up. We’ll explain more about the process in our next update. @Merijn: We’ll give more information about the process for the beta and the steps ahead in our next update. @Merijn: Chromecast is working and we’ll try to include something in a future update. On mobile devices, Chromecast will work directly from your Lima app. To cast something from your desktop, you do what you’ve always done and open the file in Chrome and then cast it. @Andreas, @Ozymandias: As we’ve always said we’re on track to ship beta testers in mid-December. We’re currently preparing an update that will explain the process in more detail. @Chante: We're going to send out deliveries for beta testers in December. After that we'll ship Lima to all backers. We can't give you a definite date for that yet. We explained the delay and the reasons for it in one of our past updates: <url>’t changed since our campaign. We suffer from delays, as explained in our updates. As mentioned here, our next target is to restart beta in December. @ozemandias: The update is not backers only. It's open to everyone. @Joshua: We’ll send an email right before shipping to check your address and you’ll be able to change it then, but alternatively you can also just send us an e-mail at <email> and we’ll take care of it. @KC: Answer on pin in the update comments @Henrik: Since a lot of the code is proprietary, we aren't able to fully open up things like that. If you have any further questions we'll do our best to answer them. @Friddie: We're going to be restarting the beta tests with 100 backers in December. After that we'll start shipping all backers. @Ozymandias: Some of you requested the hardware in advance of shipping. As we've explained those backers would receive Limas without the software. Once Lima is shipped to all backers those who have their hardware will be able to update and use their Lima. This does not mean that the Limas they receive will have been "deliberately broken" it's just without any software. The software will be reserved for beta testing purposes. If those backers who received their Limas in advance do not tamper with it then they will be able to use it at the same time as everyone else. @Amy: We can't offer any refunds because this would put the project at risk. We're doing everything we can to ship as early as possible but we can't foresee the results we'll have from the beta tests in December so it's impossible to give you a precise date like February 1st. We can give you a time frame which is beginning of 2015. Take a look at our recent update where you can see where we are: <url>’re very impressed with creators that are able to do that many qualitative updates while staying focused on their product. We try to do as many updates as we can, aiming at 2 per month. We feel it’s the right balance between keeping you updated on our progress and working on developing the product. Note that if you have additional questions, we do answer backers on this feed on a daily basis. @Peter: Refunds aren't possible as the project is still going on. We're as frustrated as you are about the delays. We explained the reasons behind them here: <url>’re going to restart the beta with 100 backers in December. Deliveries for all the backers will follow in early 2015. @James: Please send an email to Christophe (<email>) about this and we'll put you on a waiting list for the beta testers. @Henrik, @David, @James, @Merijn: We’ll publish an update very soon to tell you where we are. @ozymandias: Our firmware is still based on OpenWRT, even if we use proprietary filesystem drivers to increase performance and stability on NTFS & HFS+ drives. @fmotta, @ozymandias: Concerning the fact that our Kickstarter project has changed: our product is still the same. You funded a project of which the development wasn’t over. It’s normal for technical details to change over the course of development. However, you can be sure our product keeps following the specifications that were given at the time of campaign. The Kickstarter TOS would have been violated if we had decided to ship a product with completely different functionalities. Again, this is not the case. @ozymandias: As we explained in the previous comments the project is still under way. We held meetups in Paris, London and Dublin and have met over 70 backers who live in each city. We can't force them all to take pictures or record the meetups and post on Kickstarter or on social networks. Nonetheless, some have done so on Twitter. You just choose not to believe them. Our intention is to take the opportunity to meet backers wherever we go. So a meetup in Las Vegas is coming up in January when the team will be at the CES. We'll confirm the date and location as we get closer to the date. As we've explained in the past, we're incorporated in the United States but our office is based in France. We only send out invitations to people who live where the meetups are held, so that we don't spam everyone with invitations when there is little chance that they will be able to come since they don't live in the same country. Yet, we have also posted the invitation links in updates a week in advance (London and Paris here: <url>#comment-8260266, <url>#comment-8138074 , <url>#comment-8078652 ) as well as on our Facebook (<url>’ve held the product. See the picture here: <url>’t meet Lokiracer. We were at our booth all day, but he didn’t stop by. @fmotta: The scope of the project wasn't changed. Our reasoning for changing the programming language was explained in a previous update here: <url>“gain time”, but to try to answer your concerns as best as possible. That’s also why we held backer meetups, and will continue to do so. We remain available here and more content will follow about the project development. Let us know if there's anything else we can to do reassure you about the project. @Ian, @Christopher: An all black and an all blue Lima have been produced, and were available on the dashboard. Regarding the other colors, we announced that in a post where we explained the redesign: <url>’s Bistro at 8am. Wifi is a bit overcrowded around here. So Amandine sent you her phone number if we have problems to meet. Please confirm us if you can make it this time! @Awakened Sleeper: The campaign made possible the production of the hardware and funded our work to finish the product. As stated before, the Lima devices (hardware part) are indeed manufactured and, as we talk, first shipments from factory to warehouses are happening. Software takes more time than anticipated, but you’ll see more results soon, as beta tests with 100 backers will start in December. @Steve: We were a little disappointed. From the 9 people who signed up, only one came to see us and we showed him the same demo as we did at the other backer meetups. Regarding your suggestion for using two different networks, we'll include this in our next demo video. @Hasan: As we've explained before, we are looking into the possibility of shipping a non-working Lima (hardware but without the software) to a few backers. If it’s possible, you will get it at the same time as the deliveries for beta testers. We'll keep you posted to confirm your shipping details. @Ian R: All of the colors have been produced and are ready to be shipped to you once the software is ready. Don’t worry, you’ll get your Black Lima in the beginning of 2015. @Aaron: The Hootoo Tripmate Elite is a NAS, so you have to create another directory for your files to be stored in. If you want access to your files, you have to move them from your local harddrive onto the harddrive that’s connected to the Hootoo Tripmate. We also have an article in our FAQ that outlines the differences of Lima to a NAS like the Hootoo Tripmate that you can read here: <url>“deleted files”: After installing Lima, all of your locally stored files will be replicated onto Lima. By default, all the files that were initially on a device, or that are newly created on this specific device are “pinned”, which means that a local/physical copy is kept on the device. If you want to free up some space, you’ll have the possibility to unpin the file, which means that it won’t necessarily have a local copy but will still remain accessible when online using Lima. All in all, the Lima can’t remove a local copy of a file that was initially on the device unless you take action. If you delete a file on your device however, it will also be deleted on your Lima. @dim3m: We are looking into the possibility of shipping a non-working Lima (hardware but without the software) to a few backers. If it’s possible they would get it at the same time as the deliveries for beta testers. @James: Concerning Backblaze, Backblaze will backup the entire content of your Lima as it will backup (among other things) your entire User directory. It’s a separate service, but it’s a perfect addition to Lima. @James: A penetration test conducted by a third party is planned. Regarding point to point traffic, all the transfers between devices are encrypted via TLS, using open-source technologies (Open SSL). @Federico: We’re going to restart the beta with 100 backers in December. Deliveries for all the backers will follow in early 2015. @Lokiracer: We've sent an email with a place where we could meet on Wednesday morning and go to the Summit from there. We look forward to seeing you there. *** Reminder: we'll be holding a meetup in Dublin tomorrow, from 5 to 7 pm. Anyone living there or going to Dublin for the Web Summit is most welcome to join. Details here: <url>’ll recover all your data. - If you had more data on the drive attached in Lima than on your devices, Lima will have previously recommended you to find an another backup option for your data (second Lima or Backblaze for example), in which case you’ll just have to replace the failed drive. @ozymandias: Concerning the Lima mobile apps : once again, the difference on how Lima works on Desktop and Mobile was clearly described in the project description. Indeed, on both desktop and mobile, you don’t have to move your files in a specific folder but as we stated: “On your smartphone and your tablet, the Lima app will enable you to browse all of your files from everywhere. You’ll be able to display all of your pictures and videos, to open documents, and to listen to your entire music library. Everything will be there.“ @ozymandias: When you will plug several drives to Lima, it will offer you 2 options: - RAID-like replication between your drives or - using the additional drives for additional storage space with no redundancy. This option is useful if you have several small drives or several Limas. Finally, Crashplan and Backblaze are pretty neat services you can use in addition to Lima. Indeed, we recommend these solutions for those who don’t want to use several Limas or several drives, as stated in the project description. @Henrik: in order to control your storage space, we’ll allow you to manage the amount of saved versions in the History settings. However, it won’t be customizable by file type. For Blu-Ray or DVD, it won’t be a bottleneck as those are files you don’t often modify. @Christopher: Yes, a security review by a third-party company is planned. @Fernanda: We’re going to restart the beta tests with 100 of the backers in December. We’re aiming the ship backers after that, in early 2015. @fmotta: -- About rootkits We don’t understand the comparison between Lima and a rootkit. If your concern is about root privileges, we already answered to your comments here: <url>#comment-8186786 As James mentions, we only need root privileges to install the Lima app. It enables us to install the proper services and OS integrations needed for Lima to work with your computer. The Lima app then runs without root privileges. -- About FUSE You can get more info about the way we use FUSE in our previous comment: <url>#comment-8086164 -- About code review Verification by a qualified third party is planned. @ozymandias: again, OS integration is different between desktop computers and mobile. The Lima app won’t replace your entire file system on your smartphone so it can’t cause any issues. Our app creates a file explorer to browse through your files. On the Lima app, you see the integrality of your files and you can have access to all of them remotely. @Henrik, -- About encrypted drives: You can get more info about it in our previous comment here: <url>#comment-8122237 -- About file replication Replicating your files with Lima will be a possibility. You can set it up by setting up two separate Limas, each with their own drive, in two different locations that will then replicate the files between them. We are also working on the possibility to plug two drives on a single Lima, to get local replication between the drives in a RAID-like configuration. In any case Lima will warn you if some of your files aren’t replicated. @Ozymandias, @fmotta: As we said in our previous responses concerning the fact that our Kickstarter project has changed: our product is still the same. You have funded a project which development wasn’t over. It’s normal for technical details to change over the course of development. However, you can be sure our product keeps following the specifications given at the time of campaign. @Lokiracer: Wednesday morning is ok for us. Send us the address of your hostel and we’ll arrange something. @fmotta we don’t create a hard-drive format and Lima doesn’t use non-standard drive format to store data on the hard drive you connect to it. As stated on the campaign description, it’s compatible with drives formatted in NTFS, HFS+, FAT32 and Ext3/Ext4. It will keep the format of the drives you connect to it. @Steve: yes, our sharing feature will allow you to share a folder with other people. The rest of your data will remain private so they won’t be able to access it. @James: You’re welcome! Sure, we’ll keep you posted. @Lokiracer yes, backup in multiple location is still a functionality of Lima. As stated in the project description, if you have two Limas you can make them replicate your data in two different places. Moreover, it'll bring you a faster access as you'll be using several connections. @Lokiracer, @Gio Note that nothing has changed on that point. We can’t modify the project description after the end of the campaign. Finally yes, Lima will be able to handle your user folders even if they are not stored in the partition your system is installed on (as long as they are on an internal hard drive). It will actually store its own data on the partition used to store your user folders. Concerning our meeting in Dublin, Wednesday is still the best day for us too. We are available as well before the conferences (8 a.m) as after (from 5 p.m). Let us know the time slot which suits you best. @Lokiracer: We sent you an email to set up a meeting in Dublin. Did you receive it? You'll be meeting Severin, Amandine and Penelope. As you've gathered from the videos we've posted, I don't think bodyguards will be necessary :) @James: As we said we’re working on stabilizing the product as a whole. Focusing on a single folder helps us isolate bugs that would be equally reproduced elsewhere. Once we’ve restarted the beta in December we’ll be able to demo the final product in its test phase. @Terry: We have only sent an email to people living in Ireland because we didn’t want to spam 13 000 people who have little chance of flying to Dublin just to meet us. But if you are ready to get on a plane and come and meet us, we’d be very honored and invite you to sign up on the link I just mentioned in the comment below. All of those coming to Dublin for the Summit, as we are, are most welcome too. *** Dublin meetup on Nov 3rd *** Concerning the Dublin meetup: we’ll be meeting backers on next Monday (Nov 3rd) from 5 to 7pm. All of those interested in meeting us are welcome to sign up here: <url>’ve already answered your comments. <url>#comment-8122312 Concerning our meeting with you, we offered you to come during the week-end back in June because Severin was in China during the week, but you couldn’t make it. Doesn’t matter: I’m sure we’ll find a time and place in Dublin and finally meet each other next week. We’ll get back to you by tomorrow by email to tell you what would be best for us (we’re still waiting for the Summit to tell us on which day we’ll be exhibiting). @Kenny: To catch up on our progress, please watch this video: <url>’re starting new beta tests with 100 beta testers along backers in December, and will ship all Lima at the beginning of 2015 according to the results of the tests. @James: The aim of Lima is to manage all of the files in the user folder. Currently we're working on stabilizing the filesystem in itself. We decided to show you a demo of the one single folder because this is the configuration we’re working on at the moment. Testing on a single folder instead of our entire computer allows to better contain the bugs. If you want to see unification in action, please see what we’ve previously demo'ed: <url>’t understand you. Did you read our comment? (<url>#comment-8186604) We’re offering to meet you on Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday according to what suits you and also works for us during the Summit. It looks like you’re the one not wanting to meet us anymore. If you still do want to meet us, please send an email to <email> so we can arrange it. @Kyle: Concerning the Family Sharing iTunes update, we haven’t tested it yet, but it normally shouldn’t change anything for Lima. @KC: Indeed. Lima’s use is optimized for Windows Explorer and for Mac Finder. @Steve: Concerning your suggestion of turning off WiFi on the phone, it’s indeed a good idea and we’ll make sure to do that in the next demo. @Ozymandias: We’ll be using FUSE - which is open source - for all the things that are at kernel level. Updates will be available on Linux using the traditional distribution update mechanisms (apt, yum). @Christopher: The mobile apps are in the stage where they’re able to be on different networks. However, our developers are still working on them and testing them at the office. @Arnold: All the trips where we met our backers were already planned and only concern the marketing team and Severin. All the developers and people working on the product itself remain in our office to work on shipping a stable Lima ASAP. So, in under no circumstances are those trips impacting the shipping date of Lima. Concerning the filesystem driver, the Lima app and services all run without admin credentials. However, note that you need to have admin credentials to install Lima’s software (including the filesystem driver). @fmotta: Lima’s stance is to give you exactly the same content on all your devices, meaning the same file tree and the same files everywhere. That means that when you’ll put To-do files on your desktop, you’ll also see those files appear on all your other devices. However, the data of the files themselves won’t be downloaded on your other devices unless you click on the files, or pin the files on your devices (right click to make them available offline). That means that you’ll see the icon of the files, and that your computer will know there’s a file at this specific place (=it’ll have all the files metadata), BUT it won’t take up storage space on those other devices. Once you delete the to-do files on your first device, it will instantly disappear on all others. Concerning your system files, they won’t be synchronized (ex: APK). Lima only synchronizes the User folder and excludes app data folders (Library folder on Mac, AppData on Windows). Concerning the HDD attached to Lima, it’s not meant, and shouldn’t be unplugged or replugged. You can not speed up the process in the way that you described. However, you should do the first setup of all your devices on your home Wifi: it will go very quickly and won’t use the Internet (so won’t take up bandwidth) as Lima will be using your local network. Concerning your other external storage devices: the first time you plug them to Lima, you’ll instantly see all the files appear on all your devices. However, as stated above, the data of the files won’t be downloaded until you open the files or pin them on one device (so until you take action). @Henrik: Glad you’re back. Thanks for your feedback. Concerning meetups, all backers are invited and we have no control over who comes, who’s critical, who’s active on social networks and KS thread, etc. The meetups are pretty informal so we don’t want to record people’s conversations. But we are ready to answer all your questions here, so feel free to ask. @Lokiracer: we’ve chosen Monday night for the meet up as all the other nights are pretty busy with Summit events. However, we’re completely open to finding another time where we can meet you and show you the demo. Can you please send an email to Christophe on <email> so that we can find a time and place that suits us all? @Kyle: Thank you very much for your support! I’d even call it an Iron Man ;) Concerning hardware, we’re still working on logistics and seeing what would be possible to ship those who want the hardware without the software (which we still advise against). At this stage, we can only say that it won’t be before a month so it could be around the same time as we ship the first beta testers in December. Concerning software, Lima devices have a firmware that will automatically update when connected to the Internet once Lima’s software is ready. Concerning iTunes, it won’t be a problem: the iTunes accounts aren’t in Lima. That means that when user A goes on his iTunes session, he will only see his music, and when user B goes on his, he will have his own music too. However, when you go in the Music folder itself, and on the Lima mobile app for instance, you’ll have all the music that’s on the computer, so music from user A and B. @ozymandias: Concerning failure: a Kickstarter project fails if the Creator is unwilling or incapable of shipping rewards to backers. This isn’t by any means our case. The hardware is already produced in China, and we’re 20 people working day and night on Lima: we’re making progress every day and we’ll soon be able to start new beta tests. @Ozymandias: Our company is American but our office is in Paris, as we’ve explained numerous times, for ex here: <url>#comment-8086133 We’ll be in the US in January for sure (in Las Vegas, where we’re going for CES), and maybe somewhere else in the US before that. We’ll be sure to hold backers meetups when we’re there and let you know. @Steve: If you’re traveling to Paris while your Lima is at home in the US, you will indeed be able to see all your files on your iPhone from Paris and if you take a picture for instance, it will be instantly sent to your Lima in the US over the Internet. Our demo doesn’t show that part because it’s difficult to show 2 devices over different networks in a single video. But we'll take your feedback into account for future updates. @Lokiracer: We previously answered the questions in your list: <url>#comment-8122255 As we already mentionned, some of your statements aren’t correct. @Steve: The demo was to show everyone what we were showing at the meetups and to show the hardware setup. We already demoed the software in previous videos: <url>’t force people to post pictures on social media. Some backers did post about the event on Twitter: <url>’t want to ship Lima’s hardware without the software, as you just can’t use it without the software running. @Max: Lima will still allow you to share files with your family or anybody else. With Lima you just have the additional advantage that files in your user folder will be synchronized between all your devices. @London backers that attended the meetup yesterday: Thank you very much for coming, it was great to see you (and your families for some ;) ) and answer your questions! @Dave and all others wanting the hardware: We are indeed considering it and will contact you by email. @Dave @Lokiracer: We’ve posted pictures on our Twitter account (London: <url>’t force people to post pictures on social media. Note that some backers did post about the event on Twitter: <url>’t be any issues in your case. We were speaking about the hard drive that is hooked up to the Lima. If you have an SSD in your PC, Lima will not add any additional writes to it. @Scott Lorna is right. It’s an application for a trademark from our French company. @Christopher: Forgetbox is still the name of our French company. @Robert: A lot of people had questions about the hardware which is why we posted the update to show it. We understand the importance of the software and we will be showing you more soon. @All of those who want the device without the software, it’s duly noted. @Hasan Like we said in our previous responses, using the infinite symbol as a logo is something that is very common. @Lokiracer We appreciate that you encouraged us to contact you with corrections for your summary, but we’re a bit confused: we’ve answered all of these questions already (On October 9th and onwards). For some of them, several times. We agree making a list is useful. But we think that if this list isn’t updated or only serves to aggregate misinterpretations, then it’s more of a trolling than a summary. We want to take your feedback seriously, and answer your questions. We think you’re a great commenter. We know your intention is good, and we need you to help us keep the conversation constructive so we can all focus on the real questions & feedback. Regarding the list, we’re completely open to address it (see below) and we can check together items you feel are not sufficiently discussed. 1/ Patents are a confidential process. It’s normal that they stay secret as long as possible. 2/ We have some hardware at our offices, but the majority of the production is in Shenzhen waiting to be shipped to warehouses where they’ll be ready to be sent to backers as soon as the software is ready. See yesterday’s update for more info: <url>’m not sure what you mean here, but since one of Lima’s key features is to enable you to stream stuff away from your home thanks to the Internet, we are indeed looking at the quality of the WiFi in the places where we’ll be holding meetups. 5/ CGC is an American company, legally and administratively responsible for this campaign. It is the one handling the funds. It is also the one managing & paying production. It’s incorporated in Delaware, at 2915 Ogletown Road #1837 Newark, DE 19713. So we logically put this address on Kickstarter. The team behind the product Lima however, is located in Paris. You can have a peak into our Parisian offices on this Tyba page: <url>’t violated KS TOS in any way: we will deliver the pledges as promised. We are just late. 7/ Preordering and backing is different. You funded the development of a project, through its ups and downs, by pledging. We used that funding to manufacture the Lima product and finish developing its software. People who pre-ordered a device later on our website did it like in a regular store. They are not funding a project, but pre-ordering a product. It’s not the same type of contract. Pre-orders get Lima at a higher price, they will receive it after Kickstarter backers and they are allowed to get a refund if they cancel their order at least 15 days before shipping. 8/ We’ve already shown you the way Lima works here <url>’ll be showing more at the meetups and on Kickstarter soon. 9/ Concerning the fact that Lima will replace the file system of your OS: yes, that’s what we do. The project hasn’t changed since our Kickstarter campaign, and we’re still working hard to build Lima as we promised it to you. This innovation was explained in further details in the FAQ of our KS page : “The main innovation in Lima is that it manages all of your data for you. Not only the content of a specific folder. The Lima app replaces the entire file system of your computers. It handles everything: from the pictures in your "My Pictures" folder, to the files on your Desktop.” This is a very big responsibility, and this is why we’re taking the time necessary to make sure it’s stable and safe for your devices and your files 10/ UPnP isn’t a requirement for Lima: it’s simply the principal method that Lima uses to do cross-firewall communications. Lima will continue to work perfectly if UPnP isn’t available, and not necessarily using our servers. We're also working on other methods, such as enabling you to open a port manually on your router. 11/ We’ll ship towards the beginning of 2015 yes. We’re not giving you a more precise date as it depends on the results of the beta tests that start again in December. 12/ We rebuilt the software in C to give you a more robust product from the start. Explanations in our video 0’50”: <url>’t just black and white. There was multiple reasons for delays that we’ve explained here <url>’14”) 14/ We never said it was completely finished, and we didn’t finish it because we switched to the C version and put all our energy on that. 15/ Betas have been paused, Explanations in our video 3’53 <url>’s offices <url>’t a surprise and the bugs you seem to be referring to are solved. However, in such a complex project, Unicode isn’t something as simple as it seems. 17/ See answers 12 and 13. 18/ Lima will work on computers with multiple users. However Lima isn’t a multiple-user device: you have to have one Lima per user, just as you need to have one iPhone per user or one Jawbone per user. If you’re using a computer with multiple users, each user will need to have his own Lima, and his own session to work with it. 19/ Yes, your Lima syncs the integrality of your files from your “user” folder. Its a personal device that will only be used by yourself, so we don’t see why you wouldn’t want to have your family videos on all of your own devices. Don’t be mistaken here: files in your Lima can’t be seen by anybody else than yourself, unless you choose to share specific folders with other people. @Henrik Lima doesn't currently support encrypted drives (e.g. drives partitioned with an encrypted HFS+ partition). However, a version encrypting your files on the drive connected to Lima (over a non-encrypted partition) is planned. Regarding SSDs, Lima will use them a bit more than a computer does, as the disk will be used each time one of your devices wants to read your files. Lifetime shouldn't be degraded more than when you plug a drive into a classic NAS device. About multi-user devices, Lima *does* support multi-user devices. However, Lima isn't a multi-user device itself (just like your iPhone). @Terry Your Lima can be connected to as many personal devices as you like: your smartphone + your computer + your tablet + your other computer + etc., as long as its your devices. What we meant was that 1. There can only be one Lima per person. 2. Lima is based on the principle that your devices are only used by yourself, like your smartphone. In cases where there are multiple people using the same device, for example a computer (as family computers), we recommend using different sessions for each user to make sure that each Lima user is the only one with access to his personal data. @KC: The Lima devices are indeed sealed. If you want to see how, you can check the video we posted in the update : <url>’ll continue to update our backers approximately every two weeks. We cannot control who receives the update. However, if you want to stop receiving these emails, you can change the settings on your Kickstarter account. It should do the trick. Tell us if it works @Chris Currently, Lima is based on the idea of one computer per person, so it’s not yet ideal for family computers. In your case, our advice to start would be to create different sessions on your home computer, that can be protected by a password. A work mode is on our roadmap but is something that is planned in for after shipping. Lima is very different from ODrive. 1/ ODrive is a cloud aggregator. 2/ With Odrive, you can’t see the files inside a folder before you’ve manually synced the folder. 3/ If you want to keep your files off the Cloud, you need to set up a server yourself. 4 / And most importantly, Odrive doesn’t unify the memory of all your devices. With the unification from Lima all your files and folders get synchronized so you don’t need to move your files to a specific folder to have them on all your devices. Regarding the logo we were as surprised as you about it. We are in no way associated with ODrive. But as we’re sure you’ve noticed it’s a very common symbol to use as a logo. @Gio Don’t worry, the expert mode to sync files outside the user directory is in the works. @chris I’m sorry because there seems to be a big misunderstanding here, and we’ve obviously explained things badly somewhere if you’ve understood this. Here are the answers: A. You have to be online to have access to the *integrality* of your content. What does that mean? Let’s say you have a 2TB drive and a 300 GB computer. With Lima, you will see the 2TB of files on your computer as if they were on your computer. - As long as you’re online, you can click, view, modify, etc. any of those 2TB of files. - When you’re offline, you continue to see the icons of those 2TB of files, but you can only click on those that are stored locally on your device, which means your initial capacity of 300 GB (the files that aren’t stored locally will be grayed out). So, how do you decide which files are stored locally and which aren’t? That’s what we call the “pin” function. When a file is “pinned” on a device, it means that there’s a local copy saved on the device. By default, Lima pins all the files that are created on a device. So, when you install Lima for the first time, all the files that you have on your computer will be pinned by default on your computer. When you create a new file on your computer, it will also be pinned by default. You can also pin files or folders manually. For example, if you take a movie with your smartphone, it will appear right away on your computer. If you want to be able to access it offline on your computer, you just have to do a right-click and pin it. This pin/unpin function is key in Lima and quite unique. This is what enables you to have 2TB of data on your computer or smartphone (which is something Dropbox can’t do), and keep your content unified at all times, regardless of size limitations. B. You’re right that this is an all or nothing approach. The whole point of Lima is to have exactly the same content on all your devices, which is why you can’t sync just a part of it. This is also why you don’t have to move your files to a specific folder in order to have them synced (like you do on Dropbox) : if you create a new file on any of your devices, it will appear right away on all your other devices, without any action required on your part. If I recap: - You use your devices exactly like before, except that they now all contain the same files and the integrality of your files. - If you’re planning to go offline and want to see a file that hasn’t been created on the device, you have to do a right-click on it (or a swipe on your smartphone). You can see this in my demo here: <url>’t worry about having “less” files when you’re offline: you’ll always have at least what you used to have before Lima. And where you’re online, you will have absolutely *all your files* on *all your devices*, from pictures that were taken 10 years ago to your latest presentation. I hope this is clearer. Don’t hesitate if you have any further questions. - Penelope @ozymandias: we think there is a big gap between syncing the content of a single folder, limited in size, between your devices, and having the same user files on all of them @James The paradigm on desktop computers and on mobile is different: - On iOS/Android, there is no integrated file explorer to browse through your files, so our app creates one. On the Lima app, you see the integrality of your files and you can have access to all of them remotely. All the pictures you take get uploaded to your other devices. - On PC/Mac, Lima is fully integrated into the OS to the point where, at first, you don’t really see a change in your computer experience. Using your computer with Lima is the same as using your computer without it, except for one difference: instead of containing only your computer’s content, your filetree will display the integrality of your files - even the ones that are stored on other computers or devices. If you create a file on the Desktop of your Mac, it will be displayed instantly on the Desktop of your PC. Having a distributed index between your devices is indeed a good thing. Our “core” provides one. However, technically, we also need a filesystem to be able to display the files on your computer that are not locally stored on it, and at the right place (your Desktop, your Documents folder, etc.) This filesystem must be sufficiently integrated to make sure your computer experience stays seamless. The integration with the OS in itself enables your computer to react properly to the new use cases Lima introduces: when your computer is offline, the files that are not physically stored in it are grayed-out. If you want to access them when off the grid, you need to ask Lima first by a simple action that we call “Pin”. “Pinning” a file asks Lima to keep a copy of it on your computer, so you can access it when offline. The HDD connected to the Lima device is here to enable you to access your files even if the originating devices that created them are shut down. On your computer, everytime you create or modify a file, we indeed intercept every call to the filesystem and sync your data to the HDD attached to Lima. A copy is left on the originating machine and another is stored on the HDD. So at the end of the day, the HDD becomes a sort of reference storage device: it stores a copy of everything. If a device isn’t available to provide a file, Lima will use this HDD to provide it. Concerning selective sync, we aim to provide a solution where you don’t have to think about that. We firmly believe having different user files on different devices is not the best way to get an immersive cross-device experience for the end user, so we sync all the things the user needs. As you pointed out, that only includes the User files. In all the consumer-oriented OSes, these files are stored in a similar folders architecture, in a User directory. So we sync this architecture between your devices, without touching system files or application-specific files (eg: your Google Chrome binaries and settings files) Concerning competitors, yes things are improving as we’re not the only ones to think people want the same content on all their devices. However, at this point, we’ve haven’t seen any solution capable of taking the integrality of a user’s content, and syncing it seamlessly across multiple computers. All in all, the hardest part of Lima to create is that once you’ve installed it, it should be so native that you don’t even realize it’s here. That’s what’s complicated, and that’s what’s taking so long to build. But that’s also what makes it so unique and worth waiting for. Concerning TV integration, we want Lima to be able to act as a UPnP server, to enable you to have access to your media files from your connected TV. Lima will also work with Chromecast and Apple TV to enable you to stream your content even more easily. @monkeywrench About the case being glued and the removal of JTAG: this is pretty standard in the electronics industry. Concerning the openness of our code, we’re sorry there was a misunderstanding. We’re using open source technologies and will be happy to contribute to them when we can, but Lima in itself isn’t open source. This hasn’t changed since our Kickstarter campaign. Concerning automatic updates, this is something we do for security issues, to make sure your Lima is always up-to-date with the latest and most stable & secure software version. @Jminca, Christophe has normally sent you an email so that you can change your address. We haven’t shipped yet and plan to have new betas in December with a 100 people, and ship all backers at the beginning of 2015 depending on the beta tests results. You can have an overview of our progress in the latest update here: <url>’t plan for anything like this, but if ever our company crashed and we wanted to make our code open source, we would have to open source our servers’ code and our firmware’s code, and give access to the domain name used for our updates to a maintainer in the community. This would enable the open source community to update the Lima devices of willing users via Internet, without opening or modifying the devices. So, it’s not a problem that Lima’s hardware is sealed and that our JTAG port is disabled. It’s standard in the industry and won’t block you in case of problem. We’ve already seen other companies give the keys of their firmware update toolchain to the open source community like this, and it worked quite well for the users. @Terry Yes, people who pre-order their devices now should receive their devices in Spring 2015. As soon as our software is proven stable enough after the beta tests, we'll ship all backers, then previous preorders, then preorders from now. @Christopher The move from Python to C was decided after the campaign and documented in an update on December 11th. @Terry We were answering a specific question from Sebastian about Android and Windows. Lima will also support Mac OS, Linux and iOS as stated on the Kickstarter project. @James When we say we replace the filesystem, we do add a layer that sits on top of the filesystem that was already here (NTFS, HFS+, EXT4), which means that if you remove the Lima, you’ll have the possibility to retrieve the files that were stored locally on devices. And yes, we intercept syscalls of the filesystem (ex: open, read, close, stat, readir, etc.) thanks to a FUSE on OS X and Linux, and to a proprietary technology that is similar on Windows. Concerning the OS releases, as we previously said, the implementation of all the intelligence of Lima is multi-platform, and therefore generic. It's the same for all types of devices, and all versions of OSes. Of course, a platform-specific layer exists upon the Core to implement platform-specific features (filesystem driver, file's overlays, context menus, etc.). The core plus this platform-specific layer are what we call the "Client". We have one dedicated and specialized developer per platform: Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows (and the Lima). Those developers have written the specific code needed for each platform, and will continue to adapt them as OSes come. Some of the platform-specific IPs we use are open-source, and being maintained for the new OSes' versions by the open-source community, which eases the task. So Yosemite isn’t a problem, it’s just an extra layer of compatibility that our Mac developer codes. And our iOS app is already supporting iOS8. Concerning competition, of course it’s something we’re closely looking at, but we haven’t seen anything comparable to what we do yet. Were you referring to something specific? @Adrian We think Dropbox is a great company and we deeply admire them. However, Dropbox and Lima are very different technically. Dropbox enables you to synchronize a folder, while we create a decentralized filesystem. So it’s just very hard to compare the two in terms of development. @Henrik, see just below for your answers We think there was a misunderstanding. UPnP isn’t a requirement for Lima: it’s simply the principal method that Lima uses to do cross-firewall communications. Don’t worry: your Lima will continue to work perfectly if UPnP isn’t available. We have trouble finding where we could have said otherwise. Could you point us to the page that mislead you so we can correct it? Concerning VC funding, we don’t know what you’re referring to either. We didn’t *need* VC funding to ship in the first place. We also have trouble understanding why you’re holding against us the fact that we’re spending more money than we’ve raised on Kickstarter to build the product. Concerning the documentation of our spending: according to KS TOS, this is something we will have to do if we’re unable or unwilling to complete your project, which isn’t our case. However, we are quite transparent on this point: as we’ve already said below, the majority of the Kickstarter money was used for hardware production, then hiring, and a part is reserved for shipping costs. Concerning the fact that we’re now answering more questions on this thread, well we’re glad you’re encouraging us in this way. We did say in the last video that we wanted to interact more with you, and complete the updates with additional information + meet some backers. We’re always glad to answer your constructive questions here :) Concerning your last question, the fact that having 18 times more backers than anticipated would mean we’d have to take more time to ship a great product to everyone wasn’t something we had planned before the Kickstarter campaign. That’s what we tried to explain in the video. This is a Kickstarter project, and a lot of things pop up along the way. Concerning our location: CGC is indeed an American company. This company is responsible legally and administratively for this campaign. It is the one handling the funds. It is also the one managing & paying production. It’s incorporated in Delaware, at 2915 Ogletown Road #1837 Newark, DE 19713. So we logically put this address on Kickstarter. The team behind the product Lima however, is located in Paris. You can have a peak into our Parisian offices on this Tyba page: <url>’ll have a Lima application that gives you a file explorer enabling you to access the integrality of your files. For more info about how it looks, you can watch this video: <url>’re focusing on current OS versions, i.e. from Android 2.3 and Windows 7. @Matt As we’ve explained below, the fruit hasn’t changed. We’ll be shipping you the product that you’ve backed: a Lima. Concerning UPnP, its use is standard in the industry when building systems with cross-firewalls communications. This protocol is used by a lot of common applications, such as Skype. Concerning the fact that Lima will replace the file system of your OS: yes, that’s what we do. The project hasn’t changed since our Kickstarter campaign, and we’re still working hard to build Lima as we promised it to you. This innovation was detailed in further details in the FAQ of our KS page : “The main innovation in Lima is that it manages all of your data for you. Not only the content of a specific folder. The Lima app replaces the entire file system of your computers. It handles everything: from the pictures in your "My Pictures" folder, to the files on your Desktop.” This is a very big responsability, and this is why we’re taking the time necessary to make sure it’s stable and safe for your devices and your files. Concerning demos, we’ve already showed you the way Lima works here <url>’ll be showing more at the meetups and on Kickstarter soon. Concerning pre-orders, pre-ordering a Lima isn’t the same as having backed the project. You funded the development of a project, through its ups and downs, by pledging. We used that funding to manufacture the Lima product and finish developing its software. People who pre-ordered a device later on our website did it like in a regular store. They are not funding a project, but pre-ordering a product. It’s not the same type of contract. Pre-orders get Lima at a higher price, they will receive it after Kickstarter backers and they are allowed to get a refund if they cancel their order at least 15 days before shipping. Concerning Kickstarter’s TOS: pledges could be cancelled during the funding period of the campaign, according to those TOS. Now that the project is funded, and still in compliance with those terms, we’re using the funds to develop the Lima project and fulfill your rewards. As the project is still in progress and we’re still willing to deliver your rewards, there are no refunds planned at this point. Concerning CGC’s location, I confirm that the CGC company is located in Newark, DE in the US. Concerning hardware, please note that we’ll publish an update on hardware production next week and that we’ll show the finished hardware that we have in our offices at the backers meetups next week (Paris on the 16th, invitations sent, and London on the 19th, invitations to be sent soon). For those who want to attend the Paris meet-up, you can already sign up here: <url>’s key feature is to enable you to stream stuff away from your home thanks to the Internet, we are indeed looking at the quality of the WiFi in the places where we’ll be holding meetups. Concerning logistics (@Hasan), since 80% of our backers are located in North America and in Europe, we have two warehouses, one in the US, one in Europe. As you’ve highlighted it, setting up an efficient Supply Chain is essential and we’re following the plan to make it happen. 1/ Organizing the import of all Lima devices from Shenzhen to these 2 warehouses. When it’s the first time that you’re importing a product, there are a lot of documents to file and show (certifications, invoices, customs papers, insurance, etc). There are also a lot of stakeholders involved in this process, so it may imply some extra difficulties. Having 2 warehouses means more work since we will have to do all of this for each zone, Europe and US. We’re in the process of shipping one ‘test’ palet to each zone in order to check everything is going alright. Once this test is successful, it means we’re able to ship all the products safely. 2/ Setting up the shipping from the warehouse to your mailbox. This is also an important step and we want to do it right to avoid any annoying situations such as lost parcels, wrong addresses or misdelivery. Plus there is the whole IT between us and our logistic partners that we test and optimize when we’re doing these individual deliveries. If we ship beta-testers in advance, we want to do it under the normal procedure to do all these tests rather than just sending a parcel with a regular Post Office. Concerning patents, it’s a confidential process. It’s normal that the patents stay secret as long as possible in the industry, as it’s a strategic asset. As @P-middy mentioned, the 18 months period of our patents isn’t over yet. @John This tweet dates back from June, and this early backer was only congratulating us for our Series A. We haven’t sent him a device yet, he was only referring to the fact that he was one of the first backers. @ All of those who want to receive the hardware before the software is ready: To be honest, it’s something we hadn’t considered at all because our hardware can’t be used without Lima’s software. However, we see that it’s important for you to see people from outside Lima with the finished hardware in hands. That’s why 1/ we’ll be showing Lima’s hardware at the backers meet ups 2/ We're looking at whether we can ship the hardware to a select number of you. This will only be possible under some conditions as it’s not the finished product and since the most important part of it (the software) will be missing. On the logistics side, we will only be able to send the devices once they have arrived in our warehouses in Europe and in the US (they're currently in Schenzen). According to our current schedule, that should be in just over a month. @Henrik Concerning an outside audit of our code, it’s something which is part of our plans, yes. @Hasan: Regarding manufacturing, we’ll publish an update next week where you’ll see the part of the production that you haven’t seen yet: Lima’s final assembly from electronics PCBs to a nicely packaged product. You can already find previous information about Lima’s manufacturing in our previous updates, here: <url>’t over. It’s normal for technical details to change over the course of development. However, you can be sure our product keeps following the specifications given at the time of campaign. @Gio: Thanks for your feedback. Concerning the need of an adapted firmware to use Lima’s hardware as a basic NAS, that’s something we could consider if Lima’s software didn’t end up working in the end. However, 1/ we’re confident that that won’t happen 2/ As of now, we really have to focus on shipping Lima’s stable software, and that’s a full time job for all our developers. We have to use all our human and time resources to work on the Lima product itself, as I hope you will understand. @James Yes, we’ll bring the hardware at the meetups, along with Lima’s mobile apps. We’re currently looking at what else we can show you according to the setups of the meetups locations (space, WiFi, etc.). @Henrik Concerning the fact that we’ve put a firmware on Lima’s hardware that will automatically update over the Internet : well yes, that’s the way it works in the electronics industry. If something ever gets wrong with the firmware update mechanism, we’ll have to break all the plastic boxes to reflash Lima’s electronics. As you understand, this is why we’ve taken the time necessary to test Lima’s electronics at each step and why we need to be extremely professional and cautious in our approach to releasing the final firmware. We need to make sure bad surprises don’t happen. @Robert Our development team is based in Paris, France, so in Europe indeed. We plan to go to the US in November, but we’re not sure yet where and when: we will let you know as soon as we know. Looking forward to meeting you too. @Adrian You’re absolutely right concerning software updates in general. However, the current problem with Lima’s software is not that it’s missing some features, but that it’s not stable enough to handle your data. Remember that our software will handle your files: even we don’t expect it to be perfect from the start, we won’t ship a software that’s not reliable enough for the safety of your data. Once that’s achieved and we’ve all shipped you your devices, we’ll make regular software updates to improve the product and correct remaining bugs. Concerning patents: we indeed have several patent-pending technologies. As you might know if you ever filed a patent, it takes a lot of time. Your application goes through several steps and is kept secret this whole time. It is only at the very end of the process (it can take up to several years) that your patent is made public and appears on the website <url>’t find them on this website. Concerning the meet ups that we’re going to hold (more on that soon, but the first ones should be in Paris on Oct 15 and in London on Oct 19), please note that we’re going to all of the places for business purposes in the first place. We thought we would take advantage of those trips to meet some of you. Those trips only involve Severin and the marketing team: Gawen and the developing team stay in our offices and won’t be moving in the coming months. @Sebastian: The casing of our hardware is indeed sealed, which is why you can’t flash it with another firmware. If you really want to flash another firmware, you’d have to break the plastic casing and modify Lima’s electronics first. If you do that, you break your Lima and you won’t be able to use Lima’s software afterwards. Which is why we highly recommend against it. Concerning our staff, I assure you that we’re a team of 20 people (Maja, Alex, Christophe, Penelope, Amandine, Martin, Alois, Massimo, Julien, Pierre, Charles, Remy, Guenole, Jean-Christophe, Denis, Marion, Pierre, Leo, Severin & Gawen) working 100% on Lima. And believe me, it’s a full time job. @Gio, @Dave: Actually, the casing of our hardware is sealed and, as on a lot of production devices, the JTAG and serial ports are disabled. So you won't be able to flash another firmware on the device. The devices were flashed with the Lima firmware in factory. This firmware will auto-update once the product is ready and the devices are activated. @dave @Lokiracer @johnny @dim3m @Fateh We are curious to know why you would want the hardware while the software is not ready? The hardware without the software will not usable, which is why we haven’t considered shipping the hardware only. We’ll be glad to have your point of view on that. Dave, if you flash the hardware, you won’t be able to use Lima’s software afterwards so we don’t recommend it. @Gio @Lokiracer/TORREDDAYTONA We can’t refund Kickstarter backers, as you’ve backed a project and we've used those funds to make and deliver your rewards. As I’ve explained below, those funds were specifically used in majority for hardware production, then hiring and a part is reserved for shipping. We will honor shipping as promised but we won’t take the risk to financially endanger shipping with refunds. Pre-orders are different. People are not backing a project, they’re buying a device on our website, through a common e-shop. Those funds weren’t vital to make the project happen. They’re a common purchase, just like on Amazon. They just have a discount for buying the product early and receiving it in only a couple of months. If they want to get a refund, they can. Our terms of use (for preorders on our website) state that " 1. Orders. Any orders for Products placed through the Website are binding. All order quantities are firm, and you may not cancel or modify any order, except as set forth in this Agreement. (…) 3. Transfer of Risk and Title; Refunds. (…) Cloud Guys may in its discretion offer you a full-refund of the Product if you cancel your order at least 15 days before the shipment date by contacting Cloud Guys at <email>. » So, as set forth in the Agreement, pre-orders can have refunds if they cancel their order at least 15 days before shipment. We have noticed all the people who have pre-ordered that there was a delay and that they wouldn’t be receiving their devices before the beginning of 2015. We will, as soon as the software is stable enough, ship you first, then the pre-orders. @People who are afraid that Lima will be outdated when it ships because of USB2. As you know, Lima is a mix of hardware and software. 99% of the innovation comes from the software: that’s what’s innovating, and that’s what’s the most interesting about Lima. So your Lima won’t be outdated when we ship, because our software has no equivalent on the market. The hardware was only chosen and adapted to fit the needs of our software and our pricing needs. All in all, the fact that there is now better hardware doesn’t impact the innovation of Lima, since the innovation comes from the software. @Nestor: We know this additional wait is frustrating. Debugging is a long task, and we're 100% dedicated to it. Regarding the meetings, anybody is free to come and meet us. Except if you need transportation to one of the cities we visit, it shouldn't cost you anything to join us. @lokiracer: It's good that you come. We'll be glad to meet! @Johnny: the $10 for shipping were asked to backers during our KS campaign (you'll find their mention in the rewards section). We count them as funds raised during the campaign. Should we do otherwise? @James Concerning on "our hopes that we will be able to keep up with OS releases": the Core, implementing all the intelligence of Lima, is multi-platform, and therefore generic. It's the same for all types of devices, and all versions of OSes. Of course, a platform-specific layer exists upon the Core to implement platform-specific features (filesystem driver, file's overlays, context menus, etc.). The core plus this platform-specific layer are what we call the "Client". We have one dedicated and specialized developer per platform: Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows (and the Lima). Those developers have written the specific code needed for each platform, and will continue to adapt them as OSes come. Some of the platform-specific IPs we use are open-source, and being maintained for the new OSes' versions by the open-source community, which eases the task. All in all, when Yosemite comes, it doesn't mean that we go backwards: it just adds an extra layer of compatibility that our Mac developer codes. @Merijn We plan to beta-test Lima in December with 100 beta testers, which means that we won’t ship to everyone before the beginning of 2015. We don’t know exactly when, as it depends on the results of those beta tests. If you’re referring to this conversation: <url>’re confident, and yes, as a company, it’s in our best interest to ship a stable product as fast as possible to all of you. Concerning the software development: there is above all a lot of debugging and bug solving that need to be done. There were some loopholes/flaws in some part of our architecture that need to be rewritten, particularly concerning the pin function and the filesystem, as we said in the update. A part of the team is also working on improving the installation process. Concerning the hardware that is already packaged as you mentioned: all the Lima boxes have been programmed at the factory with the production firmware. The role of this firmware is to auto-update as soon as it's connected to the Internet, and guide you through the installation process. Concerning the Kickstarter funds, the majority of the money was spent on production in China (NRE (Non Recurring Engineering: molds, samples, QC tooling, etc.) + actual production). The rest of the money was used on recruitment, and the rest is reserved for shipping. @Terry, We're not asking you to come to the Summit: we are going to Dublin in the first place for the Summit. We will do a small meetup for backers before or after the Summit. We will let you know, and we're impatient to meet you if you can come. @KC Concerning software: maintaining our software with 13 000 people would have been more time-consuming than what was anticipated with 1000 people. We knew there was an upgrade that needed to be done, as we tried to explain in the video, and making the upgrade of the software *before* shipping seemed the only way to have that update for everyone within a reasonable timeframe. Concerning hardware production: as we explained back in March, the problems in China kept our CTO Gawen busy for a month in Shenzen. We had limited resources in terms of developers, and Gawen was and still is the leader on this, so most developers were dependent on him. So 1/ Gawen couldn’t work on the core, and 2/ his team was very slowed down because of his absence: that sums up as a month of delay concerning software development. Concerning the demo, Lima is a product without a lot of interfaces. We showed you how it worked (<url>’t be anything more meaningful than this. Concerning pre-orders, a lot of people are interested in pre-ordering Lima on our website. Pre-orders enable people to get Lima at a discount price. They are interesting for us as a company as they enable us to calibrate the size & schedule of our next batches of hardware production. We give our pre-orders coherent shipping dates with our state of development, and, as interested people are buying a product on our website as a regular shop, they can get a refund if they want. So we’re not cheating anyone. @Merijn Yes we were indeed at a Google event yesterday night with some members of the team. We even met a backer there. Trust me that we had been working on the update all day long with Severin though. @everyone Unfortunately, there are a still a couple of elements that we need to do the complete report that we've promised. So the update will come at the very beginning of next week, and I'm sincerely sorry for this delay. - Penelope @Merijn Thanks for your honest message. What's happening is that we're unfortunately facing important issues with the beta. We're still investigating and need a few more days to assess the situation and know what these problems mean and imply. Once that's done, we'll do a full status update in a complete post on Kickstarter and not just a comment on this thread. However, since we hadn't updated you in a while, I thought it was necessary to tell you what the current situation was for those of you following our work closely here. Hey everyone, Just a quick update. We've been working on some non-trivial problems encountered with the beta tests last week. It seems some of the bugs we found need important reworking. Gawen & I are checking with the team how big the issue is to get a better idea of the whole picture. I'll do a more extensive update once we've analyzed the situation. Just wanted to let you know. S. @Lexal Thanks for sharing the article. There are indeed a couple of problems underlined in this text. - It talks mostly about the fact that in some cases, the access to your NAS from a web app outside of your home isn't protected by a password, which makes the system vulnerable. Lima does not transmit your data to a device which is not authenticated, i.e., a device on which you didn't enter your account password. You won’t be able to use the Lima web app without a password, so you won’t be able to miss that crucial security step. It will also be possible to disable the web app access completely. - Having your files available on your home local network can happen if you enable UPnP on your Lima (i.e. so that your TV can access your content). As with any UPnP device, if you enable UPnP on Lima, some of your media files (the ones you want to stream) will be available to the users connected to your LAN. They will only be protected by your WiFi password and the security of your home. As of today, the majority of consumer electronic network devices work like this. If you think your WiFi is compromised or not comfortable with this idea, it's better to let UPnP disabled. Another way to stream movies on your TV will be to use Lima with Chromecast or Apple TV, which are based on other technologies and won’t require you to put your files on your local network. @Joey Smith Thanks for trying to be a voice of reason. We are hearing your concerns. We’re at a key point in testing, and we’ll get back to you next week with more substantial news and an update. Hey everyone, - Yes, we plan to make Lima work with Yosemite. We’ve only tested Lima with Yosemite internally though, as the OS is not publicly released. - The problem we solved about foreign accents is related to the fact that Unicode is normalized differently between platforms (Mac & Linux for example). We have been handling Unicode for a long time, and we had some bugs related to the fact we didn't always normalize UTF-8 in NFC, causing a bug in the comparisons between Unicode strings (more info here <url>’t seen other bugs related to that yet. The Unicode bug was only related to the Unicode normalization. - The next group of beta testers will have 10 people. Beta tests with this group will start as soon as the Lima app is more stable on the devices of the group Santiago. - We’re having a lot of questions on the Winter delivery on our website: our goal is to ship backers as soon as the Lima’s ready and fully tested. We’ll ship preorders after all the backers have their Lima, which is why we left a margin and will ship them this Winter only. @Khürt Lima is a UPnP IGD client (like many other applications like Skype or Spotify), not a UPnP IGD server. The UPnP IGD server is running in your Internet router. The UPnP hacks are about flaws in the UPnP IGD server, which may contain security bugs. Lima can't do much to fix such bugs, as it is not Lima's code which is running in the Internet router. If you're concerned about these hacks, you should ask your home Internet provider to fix these issues and upgrade your router. @Merijn: A lot of things have been happening with the Betas. We'll publish an update with current status by this week-end. Regarding how Lima connects with the outside world, we've mainly been using UPnP, which enables us to dynamically open ports on your router (cf update <url>’s a problem. This was a must for this first set of tests with the Santiago group (3 people in total): it's the first time we’re using the files of people from outside our company, so we want to be able to react fast if any unexpected problem occurs. This first phase is about testing progressively the various components of Lima and spot critical installation and file-management bugs. The group of testers is obviously very small. We'll make it bigger little by little once Lima has proved to work well with these 3 people. The timeline is very dependent on the result of these tests. While we're in the unknown, promising an end-of-test date is difficult. We’ve already been fixing some small install bugs thanks to Thomas. We'll come back to you when we get significant results. Thanks PierJ for calling, it was great to hear your feedback. I know it's frustrating that we're not much present on this thread, but we really are on the final line here and we try to stay focused on getting the product ready. We've heard your call though, and we will post on this thread on a more regular basis, while keeping our more global updates every two weeks. @Lorna, I understand your concern and that you're disappointed. I really do. We know that communication is very important and that ours could clearly have been better. We've tried to tell you as much as we could, making our geeky prose understandable for most, and letting you know about our ups and downs. Concerning our original claims that our product was nearly ready, here is the actual situation. We did have a working prototype in Python that was nearly ready. However, we figured out it was not perfect because that initial prototype was designed for a thousand people and wasn’t meant for the masses. We thought we would iterate with a small community and track bugs all together. Given the success of the Kickstarter campaign, we didn't want to ship this first version of the Lima to 12 840 people. Thanks to your support, we were able to get the human resources to build a second version of the Lima right away with far better technologies, and specialized developers to have the best experience possible on each platform. So we’ve pretty much rebuilt the entire product architecture to make it far more robust and resilient in the long term. This is why it’s taking longer than expected on the software side. This process would have been necessary anyhow, to scale our product from a 1,000 users product to the masses. And developers know how faster it is to switch from one architecture to another before going live. It is this better version of the Lima that's almost ready and that will be very soon beta tested. We should have communicated more to explain that change from our original software to the newer version and we’re sorry for that. We didn't want to ship a disappointing product because Lima is the project of our lives. And as much as I'm sorry to hurt the brand by being late on shipping, I'd hate it even far more if you were disappointed when you received your Lima. @hc: We don't delete or refuse comments, but it might have taken a day for us to validate your comment on the blog since it was the week-end. Concerning UPnP: if you have turned it off, Lima won’t use it. You’ll be able to open manually a dedicated port for Lima on your router if you prefer. We’ll provide you with the right port number that needs to be opened. Concerning your questions about security: Are you able to change certificates? No. Did we implement non-bleeding ssh-versions? No, because we’re not impacted by this well-known security breach. Did we have a "security code review" for vulnerabilities? Planned to be done before public release. And yes, we’re RFC-conform. @ Robert Tremaroli: We will support the main formats supported by iOS/Android so you’ll be able to listen to your FLAC on iOS devices and ALAC on Android. Afterwards, we plan to add support for background re-encoding to enable compatibility & streaming on all your devices without distinction of format. It will come with a software update. - Christophe Hey everyone, We’ve read your comments and understand your concerns. We too are not happy with our product slip date. However, to assume that we are thieves, scam artists and fraudulent because our product will ship later than our original estimated timeframe is a huge leap. Our team is small yet we are very passionate about our vision of making file sharing and management simpler to use and want nothing more than to deliver the best possible product we can. To help accelerate efforts, we sought VC funding from Partech Ventures, a respected and well known firm, as we announced on Wednesday. So, all in all, yes, we are late and we couldn’t maintain the initial estimated shipping date. We have posted in-depth updates from Severin and Gawen, explaining what the issues have been and why there have been delays, even though we already had 2 years of development on the product. We really appreciate the support of those of you who rather than assume we are not going to deliver on our promise, are standing by us and rooting for us. For other supporters who remain upset, we apologize again and know that we are working around the clock to meet our estimated delivery dates. @lokiracer Our invitation to come and meet us at Futur en Seine is still valid. (<url>’ll show you a demo & you can meet Severin, Amandine and Penelope. @Merijn – we apologize again that you are disappointed. We really are sorry. We will do a full status update when Severin returns from China; on this trip, he will be getting the latest updates about our hardware production, and we’ll have a better picture afterwards. @KC He’ll make sure to take new pictures. - Christophe @AlbertChung right, we foresee a delivery date in July. Just send us your new email address on <email> so we will change it for you. Best, Christophe @linoge @ozymandias We just wanted to give you the opportunity to do it. This will be our one and only email concerning this. Other emails will now exclusively be updates about the product, or extra information that we might need for your shipping. @Lokiracer: Severin will be in China until June 13th so he won’t be able to receive you before. However, we invite you to meet Lima and ask your questions directly to Severin and the team during the Numeric Festival "Futur en Seine" in Paris. We are going to do demos on June 14th and 15th. Hope to see you there and will be glad to answer your questions on this occasion! @Ian R: Got it! Pics of the complete assembly will be attached to a specific update in a couple of weeks. Stay tuned and feel free to send us your suggestion. Christophe for the Lima Team Hi everyone, I’m sorry for not being more present in the comment section. The workload here prevents us from answering each of you with a reasonable deadline but we take time every day to consult your comments and your suggestions. I hear the disappointment from some of you, but I can only say that we’re doing our best here and working days and nights on completing the Lima development as quickly as possible. We *are* moving forward. But as fast as we would want to go, our ETA is still July. @Phasmid: We understand your concerns. We read your comments, and we appreciate the time you take to contribute. But please be constructive. Sending 12 messages a day on this page is no longer feedback, it's Spam. Picking up on individual members of our staff and insulting them does not bring anything into the conversation and is simply not acceptable. @lokiracer: If you're coming around, it can be a good idea to meet. Let us know via email (<email>), and we can try to arrange something :) @Mat Unwin: We've cross-checked on our side. Everything is okay. Does the error still appear? @Marc: sure. Next update this week. PS: If you have any questions about your rewards, don't hesitate to contact us at <email>. Christophe answers personally to each request. Hey guys, We understand your concern about this project being late. I can assure you we do everything we can to make sure you receive your Lima device as soon as possible. When funding this campaign, you funded a project. It was not just about buying a product. We take this very seriously. It makes your participation to this campaign even more important to us, and we're sincerely grateful for that. The Lima project has started thanks to you, and its development is now deeply engaged. In every project, you might find bumps on the road and experience unexpected delays. That's the risk you take when backing a Kickstarter campaign, and the risk we took when starting the project. Today, we're experiencing some of these bumps. However, there is absolutely no reason for us to believe your devices won't be delivered. The project is well underway, and our team is working day and night to make Lima a reality. The funds collected have been engaged to successfully start the production of your Lima devices, and this production is currently happening. That's why we are not in measure to proceed to any refund at this point: these funds are currently contributing to fulfill the project. To make sure you get the last info about the status of the project, please continue reading the updates we post here. We do approximately every two weeks. We try to give you a new ETA through these updates every time we have a new shipping date estimation. Our last ETA to start shipping your devices is July. You can also write us by e-mail at <email>, where we do our best to answer you quickly and personally. Manufacturing a product is hard. And what we're building at Lima has never been done before, which makes it even harder. On the hardware side, using OEM components has not protected us from getting problems in the manufacturing process (cf our updates). On the software side, our timeline suffers from additional delays. But thanks to you, all of this is happening. Even with bumps on the road, the Lima devices are being produced. Even with delays, we are currently building a software that changes the way your devices handle their data. And we're advancing every day. You are the one that make this project a reality, and we're working really hard to get your devices ready. Thank you, for your patience and understanding. S. Hey everyone, Sorry for the wait. A new update is coming on Monday! Have a great week-end, Severin PS: @Eric you'll see the team next week ;) Hey everyone, A new update is coming on Monday! Have a nice week-end, Severin Hey everyone, A little light here: @Robert: Merijn is right. In your device, there will only be the Lima app running, and no third party involved. @Marcus: To secure communications, they’ll be encrypted. @All: To answer your concerns, yes, the Lima apps will be able to connect to your Lima device from anywhere, as we’ll be using a completely decentralized VPN that doesn’t need a server to function. From a tech side, when you want to build a technology like this, there are 2 major issues to take into account: 1) your home Internet firewall / closed ports might block your app when it wants to connect to your device from outside your LAN 2) the dynamic IPs might prevent the apps from knowing at which address they can contact your Lima device back home. To tackle the first issue, we are using technologies that are pretty much similar to those used by peer-to-peer software such as Skype: automatic ports opening via UpNP and UDP hole punching among others. Concerning the dynamic IPs problem, we’ll be indeed using the same technique as BitTorrent. At the beginning, we’ll be using our own DHT. But as soon as the process is optimized, we will be able to piggyback on BitTorent’s own DHT to make things go faster. To bootstrap the DHT in the first place, we *will* be using servers to accelerate the connection process. Those servers will only serve as cache (the data they keep won’t be persistent). None of your files will be sent to them. Cutting servers wouldn’t make the system stop working, but only make things go a little slower. They’ll actually be removed when the DHT is fast enough. Does that make things clearer? @David Glad you liked the card! Concerning your question, I/O operations on storage devices are unchanged (a bit better because, by re-implementing and doing another pass, we are improving these accesses). Network protocols are unchanged. Note that I/O operations on storage devices are not directly encapsulated over our network protocols : we add a layer of abstraction making them distinct and the performance analysis of our network protocols doesn't rely on sustained or random I/O on storage devices or RAM. We are still under heavy development so we cannot give you any statistic about performance improvements. However, as using multithreading and co-routines in C, it will be definitely faster than Python running over PyPy. Hey everyone, We've sent the cards through different companies, which explains why you're not all receiving it at the same time. All the European cards have been sent from Europe, while the other ones are starting to leave from the US. A happy new year to all of you! PS: A new update is coming soon :) @Chris Welham: Yes! Windows 8 development is in our lists of things to develop right after shipping. Until it's available, we'll try to fill the gap with our web app. @Robert Mohid: Thanks for the feedback. We will think about putting an opt-out setting for the auto-update feature. However, for the user, it's not an easy choice: auto-update has the benefits of bringing OTA performance & security fixes regularly, which might also be good for privacy. @kokobin: That's what we call advertisement ;) I'm not sure LibraryBox really shares much with Lima except for privacy, but of course we like the project's spirit. Hey everyone, Concerning Update #12, we've answered more thoroughly in the comment section of the update. We will also post an update about software development progress soon. Hi everybody, It seems we've corrected most issues regarding the dashboard invitations. Everything was sent. Is someone here still having trouble getting his/hers? We'd love to fix that as soon as possible. You can write our support at team AT meetlima.com Have a great day! The team @Dan Shapir: average transfer speed on the LAN is 30Mbps (you can get this kind of details in the "Technical specifications" part of the main page). However, keep in mind that Lima doesn't work like a classical NAS or external hard drive: it caches data on your local hard drive, so your computer doesn't have to wait for the network or for the external USB drive every time you do a read or a write operation. So in most situations, it feels way faster than a classical external storage device. @Marcus Schumann: Thanks for bringing up this use case. It helps us understand more specific needs like this one. This kind of mapping is not planned yet, but it's definitely something we an think of internally. One question is quite important for me: do you take this external drive with you on the move, or do you currently keep it at Home? @Don: If we call your hypothesis A,B,C & D, I'd say: - A: Exactly. And our answer to Brandon (just below) details what happens if you sync multiple sessions. - B: That's true for sync: we don't sync files outside your user directory. However, we backup your entire computer. If you want to sync files outside your user directory, you'll have to move them to a new partition (let's call it "the Lima partition"), created just for this purpose, for expert users. - C: Yes. But to be exact, I would say 'sync' instead of 'move'. We sync all the subfolders from your user directory, except for the application data folders ("AppData" on Windows, "Library" and "Applications" on "Mac"). The folders we match between OSes currently are: "Desktop", "Documents", "Music", "Pictures", "Movies" and "Downloads". - D: You're right: the Desktop is a specific case. We avoid syncing *.lnk files and from this directory, to avoid moving links to applications specific to a given machine. In the same way, we're thinking about removing .DS_Store and Thumbs.db files from sync. That's rules we use under the hood, to guarantee it works for the user without creating any glitch. Regarding usage, you're right: with Lima, we consider that what should distinguish your machines is not the files you find inside or the capacity of their hard drive, but only the form factor. It's a standpoint. We think it can really simplify the life of millions of people, even if it is not always adapted to some advanced use cases. Tell me if it finally make more sense! @Brandon: the username associated to the session doesn't matter. Lima will just sync the session from which you logged in to the Lima app. If you log in with the same Lima account, on the same computer but from different sessions, then Lima will sync the files of these two sessions together: just as if you where syncing two different computers. That may seem more complicated than DropBox, but as a user the feeling is that all your files are synced. And that's what matters :) @David Liew: Unfortunately, that's not planned. However, we're working on a multi-user version where you'll be able to share the same storage with your family but keep your files securely separated from one another (each one having his/her own Lima account, with password). It won't be based on folders, but more on sessions: you'll need one session per user on your computer.. Hey Don, Pierre, Brandon: We're currently working on explaining that better on our website, so all your input to make this clearer is super-appreciated. Here is how it works: The objective of Lima is to make sure you always see the same files, no matter which device you are using. Under the hood, this means keeping your user data always in sync between your devices. The (computer) OSes Lima is compatible with store your user data in a specific folder (your "user directory"). This folder contains: - your Desktop, - your "My Documents" folder along with other personal folders ("My Pictures", etc.), - and a folder to store some of your applications' data (AppData on Windows, Library on Mac). Lima synchronizes this entire user directory between your devices, except for the application data folders. Also, inside your user directory, Windows, Mac and Ubuntu all define some default folders to put your data (Desktop, Documents, Music, Pictures, Videos, Downloads, etc.). So Lima matches these directories between your devices: for example, if you have a Mac and a PC, your "Documents" folder on your Mac will be synchronized with your "My Documents" folder on your PC. The other thing Lima does is backup. Lima backs up your entire computer, even the files that it doesn't synchronize between your devices. This way, you can recover even your application data if ever your computer crashes (ie: your Outlook e-mails). Note that if you have several user sessions on your computer, Lima won't sync or backup the files you are not allowed to access yourself. These files are not taken into account, because following your OS' philosophy, they are not yours. In its current version, one Lima device can only be used by one person (eg: you can synchronize your Pictures directory with your wife, but she won't be able to unify the memory of her devices without having her own Lima -- it's one device, one person; one device, one session). Multi-accounts support is the next thing on our todo list after we ship. To finish, for expert users, we are working on two things: - Creating a Lima partition where they'll be able to move the files that they absolutely can't put in their user directory. This partition will be synchronized between all devices; - Adding an opt-out feature so you can remove some folders (or file extensions) from sync. Does that better answer your questions? @Jacob Tyler Abercrombie: We're sorry for the misunderstanding. The shipping fees are not here to remove your $10 discount. They need to be included for all reward tiers, as indicated in the description of the rewards. You'll still get your $10 discount compared to other backers, and in addition you'll have the right to get a limited (blue) edition of the Lima device. Don't hesitate to contact us if you need more info! (PS: we'd also love to learn about competing products -- don't hesitate to shoot us a private message if you have some info!) @dokumaya: You're right to ask about addonics. As said before, their device uses the same casing and hardware base as Lima: it seems they are using the same provider as us for the hardware, MRT (you can find more info in the "Technical specifications" part of our Kickstarter page). However, their product is very different: it's a NAS dongle, which enables you to access your USB drive from your local network. On Lima, we've beefed up the default hardware from MRT by working with them and changing some components. Also, what we build is not a NAS: it's a software+hardware solution which manages files in place of Windows and Mac and enables you to have exactly the same content on all your devices, at all times. @Gio, @Chan Chan, @Familia Guzman, @Mitchell Battino, @Grant, @Rajesh K, @Eric Fortin: Coming to that in a few hours! @Trianta: A torrent app would be awesome. We're actually thinking about this kind of integrations. Not the priority right now, but definitely in the to-think-about list. @Petri Oksanen: We've finally removed the label, for the best. We needed the intervention of Kickstarter for that: we cannot modify anything on the page by ourselves anymore. Fortunately they are really helpful. @Brandon: Thx for your help too! @GoodStuff: Yes. We couldn't send automatic confirmation e-mail in response to the survey, as the process is completely handled by Kickstarter... @GoodStuff + @Albert Lang, @KittyCanuck, @Kenneth Fread, @Florent Bro Varin: ...However, we're about to publish a backer dashboard where you'll be able to check your information, select the color of your Lima device and fix payment issues. This is where you'll get the best confirmation about your pledge and shipping details. The dashboard is in the (developer) oven right now.. @Kamilah, @Tom van Hoof, @Marcus Schumann: Thx for your help answering questions here! @Adrian Lazuardi: XBMC is a good option for your TV. By using it, you'll be able browse your local network and access the media files stored on your Lima. The only thing you need is to connect the device running XBMC device to your network. However, if you only need to display pictures, movies and music, we advise the use of Google Chromecast. It's really great: it will provide you with the same features, but without requiring any configuration - and it will enable you to use your phone as a remote control. Hi there, Sorry for putting so much delay between our replies. You're completely right: we need to change that. I'm glad to say that the dark ages of communication are over. We hired someone full time to help us answer you more effectively. We'll be able to come to this page much more regularly now, and that's *really* important to us. This Kickstarter has been an awesome experience for us so far. It's a lot of challenge and reorganisation, but that's exactly what we like. I'll publish an update this weekend so you can keep up with what we're working on. I'll also start answering your last questions on this page right now. Thanks for being so supportive in your messages. You rock! Cheers, Severin (CEO of CGC) Hello Stan, Thanks for the notification. The website's source code seems clean. Do you still see this warning? Hey everybody, We've just sent a quick survey to help us plan our logistics. You should be receiving it soon if you haven't already. There's no option to select colors in this form. We'll send you a link to a backer dashboard in the a few weeks where you'll be able to select your preferred color, complete your payment (when necessary) and verify how many devices you will receive. So no worries on this side. Thanks for your help! @Marcus Schumann: 1. Correct. 2. This is something we will consider to do. Unfortunately we cannot tell you when. @Kenneth Taylor & @Marc Christiansen: Thanks. @Edgar Furse: No. If your hard-drive is NTFS, HFS+, FAT, EXT3 or EXT4, Lima will use them as is. Else, Lima would propose to format your hard-drive. So your hard-drives will be natively readable from your devices. @Tom van Hoof: A "local version" is an up-to-date temporary local copy from your Lima. So it will always be the file to its latest version. @Albert Ang: Yes, it can be unpaired. @Max Ziebell: OK. This is not something we planned, but that may be interesting in some advanced usage. For now, when you connect "Lima drives" to a device, they will be recognized as native hard-drives and you'll be able to access their files. If the hard-drives are encrypted, the Lima application will decrypt them. This is a procedure we did if you want to stop using Lima and get your data back. But we didn't think it for temporary modifications. We'll think about that. Thanks. @Tom van Hoof: Oops! Yes, you can have Dropbox while using Lima. If you have enough space to storage all your files on the local storage of your device, indeed, you will be able to ask Lima to keep a version of your files locally. @Max Ziebell: unfortunately, this is something we won't do for this version. Lima cannot be connected to a device through USB or Thunderbolt via Drobo. @Max Ziebell: Yes, you got it! The criteria for a file to "get killed" is the famous 80/20 rule: "80% of the time, you use 20% of your files". So if you access and modify a document quite a lot, it will be in this 20%, so we will try to cache it (i.e. put a local temporary copy) on all your devices. At the opposite, if you didn't use a file for a long time, it will be outside this "20%", so it will "get killed". But anyway, it will always be in your Lima when you'll need it. That means that all your important files are always with you, on the local storage of your devices. They are very fast to access and offline-available. @Max Ziebell: - We developed a decentralized VPN software which can go through any NAT when you're outside your LAN. Because it is decentralized, our servers don't do much. They just help and speed up the process. But the system is built in such way that if our servers had to disappear, it will continue to work smooth. - Indeed, you could disconnect your drives from Lima and use them directly on one device. However, Lima would be disabled and you won't see the same files on all your devices. All the files which are already on your HD's will be in folders on your Desktop. We won't remove them! You will be able to move them anywhere you want. @paul vincent farrell, Yes. Our team will maintain our software after the shipping (firmware & applications). We will provide updates to fix bugs, improve security and implement new features. @Ryan Tirrell, We're sorry to hear that. We thought a lot and explained our stretch goals decision (you can read in our FAQ for more details and on this public feed). We prefer to focus on the current solution and ensure the shipping of the first batches than adding stretch goals which would definitely put at risk the production (changing the hardware needs to re-certify the hardware, which can take a long time). @Edgar Furse, The caching mechanism is something a lot of solutions on the current market apply for different scenarios for years: Spotify, Google Music, your web browsers, ... The point to cache is to consider your local storage memory as a temporary buffer, and not a exhaustive repository of your personal data like it is done nowadays. We apply the very famous 80/20 rule : "80% of the time, we only use 20% of our data". By trying to cache this 20%, this brings the smooth possibility to access your important files as fast as they were local (something than NAS solution cannot do) with the ability to see all your personal data in your computer (something than a common Cloud solution cannot do either, as they use your local storage). 10/100 is not a real limitation in most cases. We already streamed a 1080p Bluray quality movie from Lima to a device (computer, TV, ...). It works. Reading a file is actually streaming, and writing is actually syncing in the background. All transfers (intelligent caching, synchronizing, ...) are done in the background. At the opposite of protocols like FTP, Samba, ... which are synchronous, the user doesn't _feel_ the network latency. Anyhow, it may take few days (still better than half a year to upload 1TB in the Cloud if your computer is up 12h every day), but this will be transparent for the user. The RAID argument over several locations provides a smart and affordable way to back your files up without giving your data to a third-party you have to pay every month. In such case, we're dealing with exactly the same problematic you could have with uploading large files on Cloud solutions, except that you finally have the control over your data. Lima uses a optimized version of the Wanser-R hardware. Addonics uses an old version of the Wanser-R. We do not have any link with Addonics. The Lima comes with a completely different software (firmware & applications you will be able to install on your devices) to bring you the full Lima experience. @Itry Biomed, No. UPnP is a LAN protocol. It doesn't work on a WAN. @The JJ, Your NAS synology needs to be connected to your Internet router. The same way you would do with Lima. However, note that we do not support NAS for now. This is on our TODO list, but we cannot promise it for shipping time: it might take a few months more to develop. @Gloups, NAS compatibility is on our TODO list, but we cannot promise it for shipping time: it might take a few months more to develop. We really want this to happen. @Jennifer Sun and @GoodStuff, All your devices know your entire filetree of files and their metadata, either if they are online or offline. So the searching software on Windows, Mac, Linux, ... will be able to index the files even if some are "online-available". @GoodStuff: 1) Any device access can be revoked any time you want. 2) Lima has to be configured for every user of a computer. So, intrinsically, only the owner can access to his/her data. Another user account on the same device won't see the files on the Lima if the account is not paired with it. 3) Yes. You will be able to enable a password/PIN protection each time the application will be started. 4) Uniquely. That means you will be able to see that another foreign device accessed your data (because the hacker had your password). You will be able to revoke the device. Obviously, the best thing to do in such case is immediately change your password. 5) The Lima hardware can power 1, sometimes 2, portable hard-drives (it depends on the hard-drive's manufacturer and specifications). If you connect more, the Lima won't overheat: what would happen is the hard-drive won't be detected, and you will need a powered USB hub to solve this problem. Obviously, everything will work if your hard-drives are self-powered. @prosciutboy: 1) Our team will work to improve the software of Lima (firmware, applications, ...) to fix bugs, improve security and implement new features (like one Lima handling multiple user). We will push new versions of the firmware for the Lima. 2) Definitely! We are hackers and are definitely into this philosophy. We cannot wait to see third-party applications (mobile, native, web & Internet of Things) using the Lima to create new usages! @Max Ziebell, Yes Lima should work with Drobo. It has the right kernel version for it. We didn't test it, though: our Drobo died a few months ago. @Brad Wolff, Probably no, as the size of 200 iPad movies will be bigger than 16GB. The same way you cannot ask Spotify to store 100,000 offline musics on it. However, you will be able to access all of them when you'll be online. You can choose the important ones you want to have offline, until you have free space on your local storage of your device. @Mark Svendsen, Lima does need an Ethernet cable to be connected to Internet. However, WiFi-to-Ethernet bridges exist so that you can connect your Lima to your hotel WiFi. After doing so, by installing the Lima application on your devices, all your files will be stored on your Lima. @kokobin, Unfortunately, we cannot make sure your devices will be sent together. That's why we ask for $10/device, no mater how many devices you order. It greatly simplifies our logistics. @Rafael Ramos Zavala, Yes, we do ship to México. @Stefanos Neofytidis, this is what see in our KS backer report, we hope it helps you: "$79.00 on Aug 21, 2013 Status: pledged". @Marcus Schumann, For now, you can install the CrashPlan application on one of your computer. We're planning to create a fully-integrated remote backup solution so that in a very close future, Lima will do this transparently without needing to install anything. @Vamsi: 1) Yes 2) Lima is CE and FCC certified. So it is certified to leave it unattended. Lima checks the disk attached to it in real-time. @Joseph Balderson, 1) Yes. 2) Yes. 3) No. We do this for you. The goal of Lima is to make you stop thinking about things you should not think about (like defrag). @Clem Z, Having two Limas gives you the ability to replicate your data over two locations. You can install one Lima in your home and one in your office, for example. Your Limas will automatically work together to replicate your content. Two Limas are enough. But with each Lima you buy, your data gets more secure and also faster to access. However, the two Limas are not paired when you buy them. So you can either decide to use it for replication, or to give it to a friend for his own use. @CK, here we go! 1. It will be 1TB of data. 2. Yes. Lima is UPnP compatible, so XBMC can see Lima the same way it would with a NAS. 3. If your Apple TV is UPnP compatible, your media will be accessible. 4. Yes. If you connect 2TB to your Lima, you'll be able to access and modify 2TB of files from your devices, the same way if your devices was 2TB big. Lima uses your local hard-drive to store temporary file copies ("cache") of the files you use the most to give you a faster access on your important data, or when you're offline. When you are at home, your data doesn't go through Internet but stays in your local network, so the speed transfer is really fast. 5. Using remote backup solutions like Blackbaze or Crashplan, you can back up online any amount of data you want for $5/month. Whatever the size of your hard-drives, the price is still the same. You can also do the same by your own with 2 Lima installed in 2 different locations (i.e. home & work) : they will replicate your data to avoid you loosing them if one of your location is unfortunately destroyed. Another advantage of such configuration is it brings you faster access when you're away from home, as Lima takes advantage on your several broadband connections. 6. Your iPhone music app will be able to access the files you only synchronize with iTunes. Your Lima application will give you the access to all your media (included iTunes), even if your iPhone is too small to contain all your musics, a little like Spotify would do. 7. The amount of read/write operations are not a lot bigger than the "old-way" to use them. The life span should be the same. Note we also provide ways to replicate your data over several hard-drives to avoid you loosing your data if one of your hard-drive would fail. 8. We provide several way to avoid this situation. First, if you connect two hard-drives of the same size on your Lima, you can ask to do a replication over both so that if one fails, the other one would take the lead. Also, if you buy two Lima and connect the same hard-drives, they will replicate your data over two locations. Finally, the remote backup. If any of this had not been set up and one of your hard-drive fails, only the most commonly used files which were temporary copied on your devices will be available. @Gareth Evans, about your pledge, yes, this is correct. @geronimo, Lima doesn't have any storage limit you can access at once. The only limit is a maximum of 8 USB hard-drives, no matter their sizes. @Joseph Balderson, Yes, it is. We set a default maximum value, that you can change in percentage or in absolute. By default, we don't use all your free space to avoid problems like the ones you mentioned. @Christopher Currie, Lima already uses its own VPN to secure communication between your devices. You don't need another one for more security. We don't know the specificity of the VPN you mention, but if they respect industrial standards we should be compatible. Our VPN provides a huge layer of security to the system which acts like a super-firewall and makes your data safe from the outside. We have a full team which constantly works on new updates for the software in your Lima to avoid security breaches. Lima will be very hard to hack because we are there to monitor potential threat. Yes, Lima should be compatible with PS4, because PS4 is UPnP-compatible. @BAN: Don't know if it makes more sense to put it like this, but we like to say that Lima works a bit like the mobile app of Spotify: - When you're online, no matter where in the world, no matter the size of the computer you're using, you'll see ALL of your files on it. Not in a specific folder or virtual drives, but directly in Windows (on your actual Desktop, in your My Documents or My Pictures folder, etc..). Lima makes Windows or Mac display your files no matter where they are stored. If they're not available locally, our app will stream them from the Lima device. We have a technology enabling your devices to be connected to Lima at all times, even through firewalls or strange network configurations. - When you're offline, only some files will be available on your computer: the files you'll have specifically selected to be available offline (and the files available in cache but.. let's simplify). If you want to make sure a file will be available offline, you only have to right click on it and select "Keep an offline version". A bit like you do on your mobile with the Spotify app to get offline access to music. You can always edit files when offline. They'll be synchronized with all your other devices when back online. The big difference with a NAS or router/NAS combo is that Lima literally makes all your devices display exactly the same content, at all times. Is it more understandable when explained like that? @Jannick: in this specific case, you'll have to move your files either back to your user directories (My documents, Desktop, My pictures, etc..), either to a new Lima partition available for expert users. With Lima, you don't need to think about partitions anymore. The idea is that if you have 3 local hard drives of 1TB on your computer, you'll be able to have around 3TB of files "available offline" in your My Documents folder. Behind the curtains, Lima will use the various local hard drives of your computer as it wishes to store both your "offline" files and your cache (unless you forbid it to write data on a specific drive, of course). This is a part we're working on, because we've got a lot of input from backers who have specific uses and needs of partitioning their system. Right now, the policy of Lima is to unify all your storage, including partitions. We'll work close with you guys to find solutions where this behavior is not appropriate. @Gio: Thanks for notifying us. MySkiva is a router including a NAS functionality. Just like the ones you can already find in retail (eg <url>örn Ekenberg, The mobile experience we will provide is still a work-in-progress. We want the users to have access to all their data, to give an very unified experience to the user no matter the device (s)he's using. The applications provide a common access of your files through a filetree, showing your folders and files, opening or modifying them thanks to other applications. The files you are using the most on your devices will be temporary copied on your mobile devices so that you can access and modify them even if you're offline (i.e. you worked all day on a document with your PC, it will be automatically available on your phone in the subway when you'll go home). For media contents, we provide more customized universes, like a proper music player where you can play your musics and playlists from your Lima, a video player and a picture viewer. @Itry Biomed, Functionally speaking, a little. Technically speaking, no. We developed our own network protocol, which does what WebDAV does, with more features like the "offline access" of files, Torrent-like file transfers, etc. @Naoman Sheikh, It has not been tested, but it should work. A 10/100 Ethernet interface is already enough to stream a 1080p Full HD Bluray quality video. This had been tested. In your case, the stream will be redirected through the iTunes running on one of your Gigabit device, which should not be a bottleneck here. In our opinion, the worst which could happen would be a little delay of buffering before the video starts on your Apple TV. @Gareth Evans: 1 - This is something we're working on. 2 - By connecting first your 1.5TB hard-drive to your Lima, you'll be able to swap out one of your 1TB hard-drives to the 1.5TB one. When the operation would be finished, you could safely disconnect your empty 1TB hard-drive. 3 - For now, Lima is spreading out files over the available hard-drives. If you want to disconnect one, you can ask Lima to swap it out to the others. 4 - For now, all your files would be the same everywhere on all your devices. But we've been asked during this Kickstarter to think about "universes" (what you are calling "pools", for example "the work universe" and the "home universe"), where you would not see the same files. We think the idea is interesting, and we are considering to implement it in a near future. We cannot say if it'll be ready for December. @Ikalios ans @Varun, We heard about this. It looks like it was unfounded. Here's a quote from an article of The Verge talking about this subject (full article here: <url>"Google has responded to our request for comment, and any fears that the company may bar playback of local media appear to be unfounded. "We’re excited to bring more content to Chromecast and would like to support all types of apps, including those for local content," a spokesperson tells The Verge. Google notes that its Google Cast SDK is still in "early days" and may change significantly before an official release reaches developers. Google says it aims "to provide a great experience for users and developers before making the SDK and additional apps more broadly available." Dutta has admitted that he reverse engineered the Google Cast protocol to make AllCast possible, but it seems he may have another chance to do things the proper way once a full-fledged SDK arrives. The company's full statement is below." This looks good! We keep you updated about the topic. @Itry Biomed, Indeed, we are not transferring bits faster than other ones. We make the difference between sending files and transferring data. If you send thousands of movies to a friend, this friend will be able to see the list of files and their thumbnails nearly instantly in their computer. They'll also be able to begin watching these files in streaming during the transfer. @Lorcan Fredrik Garvey, Kamilah is right, Lima is the new name of the project. We decided to change the name due to a legal claim. But this is the same product than before. @Michael Hofer: - Just the shipping date. The product doesn't change. - It needs external power to work. @Alex Winkle, We cannot do such thing because limitations are set to avoid applications like ours to access these data. It's not because we don't want, it's unfortunately because we cannot (for now). If your "iTunes library" is in your "My Music" folder, Lima will be able to access your iTunes musics (if not protected by DRM) and you'll be able to play your musics in the Lima application. @Persi@ns, We didn't test it. But we don't see any reason why it should not work, as this product is completely transparent and doesn't need any driver. That'd be interesting to know! Note that Lima can also encrypt your files on you hard-drives if you want to. @Mathan Est Mort, Torrent sync makes you able to synchronize some folders on your devices. It works a little like Dropbox. The thing is this is still yet-another-memory (as @Brandon D said). Lima is not, it is the unique memory of your devices. Feel free to read "How Lima is different from NAS devices and NAS solutions, like Synology or Owncloud?" in our FAQ for more details. @Gio: - It would work, but the two Lima may not be able to replicate their data with each other. This might be a problem if you were loosing one hard-drives, as you would loose some of yours files. - You are actually talking about "file synchronization algorithms". There are several ways to manage the situations you described. Without being too technical, the Lima keep some kind of "timed journals" of files operations to know what is the last version to keep if such situations you described happen. CASE 1: Only FileY will appear. FileX will not "exist" anymore on your first Lima. CASE 2: As one file contains two contents, this is named a "file conflict". One file will be created, named "FileX (Lima 2)", with the content of the file in Lima 2. "FileX" will contain the content of the file in Lima 1. @Eugene Cartwright, Unfortunately we cannot give you any ETA. But some of us are *really* music lovers, so we guess it should not take a lot of time :) @Ty Jero, Unfortunately we didn't test it. We cannot tell you for sure. It looks like it needs some drivers, so it may not work natively. There is a lot of storage hardware out there, and we will do our possible to push firmware upgrades to support most of them. @Mike Faimer, Lima applications are not available yet. They will be when the first Lima will be shipped. @Lee Baker, NAS compatibility is on our TODO list, but we cannot promise it for shipping time: it might take a few months more to develop. In the meantime, backing up your files on your NAS is a very good idea. It should be possible with any backup daemon out there. CrashPlan provides a very good solution for this: their software is free to use if you backup to a NAS. We really want this to happen. Be sure that it is a priority on our TODO list. @Merijn Bolhuis :) @Kamilah Thank you again for helping us to answer public questions. @Edgar Furse, The main innovation with Lima is the software we will provide in the Lima (which is a Wanser-R a little pimped, at the opposite of the ones you can find on MSRP) and especially the software in your devices. The performance of the hardware might look humble, but we think it's definitely enough for most common use-case (i.e. Lima can stream 1080p movies). Our software does a lot of precaching (cache locally files before needing them to give the faster access possible) and transfer the files from every nodes it can find around (a little like Torrent). Feel free to read the "Why didn't you design Lima with USB3 and Gigabit Ethernet (or Thunderbolt, eStata)?" in our FAQ. Thank you for this feedback! It's important to us that our future users are satisfied with our solutions. We'll spend the necessary time to improve our products. We will need a involved community to get feedbacks, iterate and make the product better and better with the time. @Robert Tremaroli, We didn't plan to build a Roku channel for now. That is interesting though. We'll see in the future. @Joshua Kohn and @Evan Catlin, We heard about this. It looks like it was unfounded. Here's a quote from an article of The Verge talking about this subject (full article here: <url>"Google has responded to our request for comment, and any fears that the company may bar playback of local media appear to be unfounded. "We’re excited to bring more content to Chromecast and would like to support all types of apps, including those for local content," a spokesperson tells The Verge. Google notes that its Google Cast SDK is still in "early days" and may change significantly before an official release reaches developers. Google says it aims "to provide a great experience for users and developers before making the SDK and additional apps more broadly available." Dutta has admitted that he reverse engineered the Google Cast protocol to make AllCast possible, but it seems he may have another chance to do things the proper way once a full-fledged SDK arrives. The company's full statement is below." This looks good! We keep you updated about the topic. @Tom van Hoof and @gabriel del castillo, About multiple users: - "Can Lima handle multiple users?" > Not yet, but it's something high in our priority list. We are working on it. Hopefully, in the near future, people living in the same house will be able to use a single Lima. They would be able to share the same hard drives, without sharing all of their data with each other. However, this "family" feature will probably come only a few months after we ship. For the time being, we advise you to consider using one Lima device per user: you will win both in convenience and performance. @Giorgio TRAVAINI, While one Lima is accessible, you will be able to access your files. If one Lima is offline for a while, it will stop replicating your data from the other one. Which is not something good as you might loose some data if one hard-drive fails during this "offline" time. When it'll come back online, it will resume the replication. So this configuration should work, although quite unstable so not perfect. @Merijn Bolhuis, Social back-up is something we thought about. We may include such feature in a very near future. @shinn, Symbolic links are managed by Lima, but not followed. Note that because Lima will manage the storage of your Users directory, you will be able to put all your movies inside. The SSD won't be used unless you require the movie to be available for offline viewing. @Jennifer Sun - Yes, Lima app support playlist. - The Lima app doesn't see the musics which are already on an iPhone/iPad. You will be able to play offline-available musics only through our Lima application. For pictures, you won't be able to access your "offlined" pictures from your photo library. Note you'll be able to share a picture from Lima to another application (a little like Dropbox does). - For the streaming while out, we tested on a MP3/AAC 320kbs with a common 8Mbit/s ADSL connection. It works pretty well. About the video, you can ask Lima to re-encode your movies in a mobile video format, with the appropriate screen resolution. The re-encoded file will be smaller and can be more easily streamed through a average home connection. Note that if you have two (or more) Lima, your devices will take advantage of all their connections: a bit like Torrent. @Gio Thank you for sharing the link :) @Eric Yip, For now we're planning to handle the most common music codecs (MP3, AAC, ...) for your mobiles. We may integrate new ones in the future, little by little. The FLAC codec is definitely on our TODO list. @Matt Burrows, The music application experience is a little like Google Music or Spotify: you can ask a music or playlist to be available offline. The application will download a copy of your musics from your Lima and store them locally on your phone. So that when you'll listen to your musics, the mobile network won't be used and you won't experience any interruption even if you don't have any network. @Giorgio Travaini and @Walt We're waiting for the list of backers and their locations to try to optimize the shipping process. We will do our best to avoid the customer taxes. Unfortunately we cannot promise you anything for now. @Giorgio Travaini, Here we go: - Developing a new firmware requires some new development and a lot of testing. This option will definitely put at risk the shipping for December. - Indeed it looks like a mistake in our FAQ! Thank you for pointing it to us. The correct way is to add $10 per Lima. So if you backed us on our December backup batch at $129, you need to add $20 for shipping. - This USB port behind TVs are commonly used to connect your hard-drives. In our situation, your hard-drives are already connected to your Lima. We don't know any "Ethernet to USB cable" which could do the work. We guess the easier way is to use a "set-top box" which will make you able to play your media on your TV from your Lima (Google Chromecast being one of the cheapest). - A simple solution would be to connect your amplifier to your TV which is connected to a "set-top box". @Daniel Schotborgh and @David Ackermann: For now, no: Lima is not seen as a Time Machine. But this is something we already thought about and we will maybe do it in the future. @loner1200 Here we answer the questions of different messages: - About RAID. Yes we do :) We don’t want you to loose your data if one of your hard-drive burns. So we provide you an easy way to replicate your data over several hard-drives. When you add a new hard-drive to your Lima, it may be used in two modes: 1- normal, where the space of the hard-drive is added to the Lima space (I connect a 2TB hard-drive, I have 2TB space more in my devices) 2- replication, where the space of the hard-drive is used to replicate files from the other hard-drives, to avoid loosing them in case of failure. So like RAID. - Lima keeps every recent versions of a file you modify. So everything will be stored in Lima. If you're offline while you modify your files, your modified files will be queued and sent when you'll be online again. Because Lima keeps temporary local copies, you can access and modify these files while you're offline. - Indeed, Lima keeps in cache the files you use the most (you use 20% of your files 80% of the time) on your devices. So your tablet can cache automatically a file you use a lot on your PC. @Nicklas Johansson :) @R.M. - Lima provides on Windows, MacOS and Linux a native filesystem, integrated natively in the OS. So yes, your terminal (and any other programs) will be able to see the files in Lima. - We will provide a CLI command, which should work with any Linux distribution. We are finalizing an integration for Gnome's Nautilus. - Lima will not manage configuration files for the reasons you mentioned (as they are hidden files). @Marvin 1 - Yes, one Lima is fine. You can ask Lima to replicate your data over several hard-drives (RAID 1). 2 - Lima will manage these spaces as 1 logical storage. You can decide if you want an hard-drive to add space to your devices, or to replicate your data for safety. @pipersw Your devices will have the minimum capacity of your Lima (i.e. a Lima with 4TB + a Lima with 2TB => you will be able to manage 2TB). To be properly replicated, your data should fit on the Lima with the smallest storage space. If your two Lima have very different storage sizes, the app will guide you to fix that. @Brian: Yes. See the last bullet point of my comment to Jennifer (second one below this one). She had the same question. @Sergio: You don't need to activate sharing. On your phone, our app will display the exact same contents than your computers, even if your computers are offline. This is because Lima keeps a copy of your files in the hard drives you've connected to it. And it makes your data available to you whenever you need it. Regarding how it works, it's a bit like Skype: Lima can connect directly to any of your devices in Peer-to-Peer (P2P). It has the technology necessary to establish connections even through firewalls and even if your Home IP is changing. Security is handled by our apps: everything is encrypted, and you'll need your password to see your files. In case you lose your devices, several security mechanisms come to play: see the last bullet point of my comment to Jennifer, just below. @Jennifer: No problem. Those are great, pertinent questions. I'll try to answer them by order: - Our mobile app is like a simple file browser app. You'll see a list of folders (Documents, Pictures, Videos, Music, Desktop, etc..) at first. In the Pictures directory, you'll be able to see your pictures as a grid of thumbnails. We might not cache *all* your thumbnails on your phone if you have 70k pictures, but if you have Internet we'll stream the thumbnails when you browse your pictures -- as thumbnails are quite small, you'll see them fast. Anytime, you'll be able to download a specific album or picture on your phone by pressing a long time on it's icon/thumbnail, and selecting "Keep offline version". If you do, the selected pictures will be downloaded on your phone along with their thumbnails and kept there. Every time you click on a picture that is not "kept offline", we'll display this picture in streaming. When in a slideshow, we'll cache the next pictures as fast as possible to make your experience smoother. - On your computers, we'll keep all your pictures thumbnails and metadata in cache if the available space allows it. So browsing will be very fast. In the same way as on mobile, when you start opening a picture in streaming, Lima will try to cache as fast as possible the other pictures in the same directory. - On your phone, you'll have to use the Lima app if you want to play all your music. Your default music app (eg iTunes) won't be able to see the music stored on Lima. On Android, it's something we can work on in the future. The Lima app works a bit like Spotify mobile or Google Music for playing music. When connected, you can see all your music. When offline, you'll see only music available offline. Same as with the pictures: press long on a song or album, and you'll be able to make it available offline. - About auto upload: Yes, the Lima app will take any opportunity to auto-upload the new pictures/videos/sounds/documents you take/download on your phone. However, we're aware that some 3G/4G plans are very limited in terms of data. So you'll have a setting to enable auto-upload only when you're on Wi-Fi. In the same way, you'll be able to forbid the Lima app to auto-cache or download files over 3G/4G. - About security: to make sure nobody accesses your data after stealing your phone, you'll be able to disable + wipe out any device from our website and from the Lima app. You'll also have the option to log out from all your devices at the same time. If you fail entering your password too many times, we'll block your account. We'll ask you to reactivate it by e-mail. If you forgot your password, you'll have to physically interact with your Lima device, at Home, to reset it. - You nailed it. We make the difference between sending files and transferring data. If you send thousands of movies to a friend, this friend will be able to see the list of files and their thumbnails nearly instantly in their computer. They'll also be able to begin watching these files in streaming during the transfer. Hope it gives you a clearer picture! Thanks for your support :) @Ken: We've put this "time lag" to make sure we can ship it at this date. It might seem a long wait, but we really don't want to promise you earlier shipping if we cannot make it. Behind the curtains, two reasons made us select April as a new date: - Our manufacturer is not fully available for us between December and February (December is a busy month for them, and in January-February most of their workers get holiday for the Chinese new year) - We'd like to make sure everything works well with the first batch before beginning the production process of the second batch. This way, we'll be able to keep a better focus on customer support and make sure Lima works well for all first-batch backers. We know it's hard to wait (we're -really- eager to ship), but we'll make sure it's worth it! @Alex Winkle: Encryption/decryption of your files is performed on the device side for performance reason. If your Lima breaks, you can disconnect your hard-drives and connect them to a computer. You will be able to access your data by connecting your hard-drives to one of your device. Our application provides you a "clean procedure" to reconvert a "Lima"-ed hard-drive to a normal one, usable from any device. @pipersw: Lima can power one 2.5’’ hard-drive by itself. @Don Gateley: For the time being, we don't do any folder mirroring between Lima and the outside system files. But that's a god feature to think about. Yes, if you connect several drives to Lima, they will be used as a unified storage pool. If you share a folder with a friend who lives in China, his/her Lima and your Lima will connect to each other in peer-to-peer to share your data. The communication is encrypted and will link to your personal IP, so it might just work even through the firewall. (We haven't tested it yet, though). @Don Gateley: We’re getting technical here. For now, Lima doesn’t follow symbolic links: symbolic links pointing out of Lima mountpoint will be stored “as it”, and will be shown only on UNIX systems. The folders they point to won't be backed up by Lima. If you have a symbolic link outside the mountpoint of Lima (and pointing inside this mountpoint), everything will work fine: Lima acts like a filesystem, so everything works natively (like SSHFS). For your situation, what we advise is to move the non-user files you want to put in Lima into our advanced "P:" partition (typically "/media/lima-for-experts" on a Unix system). You can then use symbolic links in your system to point to this partition. @Roger: Lima doesn’t bypass the DRM security: so if you have DRM protected files on one device, they might just not be readable on the others (it really depends on how you set up your Apple account on all your devices). Fortunately, it seems Apple provides DRM-free MP3 on iTunes. For the movies, it's another story.. At least, you'll be able to read movies acquired elsewhere on all your devices. @Eugene: If you want to add devices to your pledge, you can add $79 per additional device or $149 per group of 2 additional devices. Your initial rewards will be shipped at the same date than before, and the additional devices you add will be shipped to you in April. @Giorgio: We haven't tested Lima with the XBox One yet. However, Lima acts as an UPnP server for media devices. So we don’t see any reason it wouldn’t work. Concerning the hardware, we must precise that we are absolutely not affiliated with Addonics. We can't use their devices. They also sell a product based on a cheaper version of the Wanser-R, but that's the only link that ties us. To respond to your point, changing the hardware right now would be too risky, as we would have to adapt the firmware to the new platform. We prefer for now to stay focused on this hardware and to make sure we deliver a product that works. @Giorgio: If you have two Lima devices, they start replicating each other data. A: To be properly replicated, your data should fit on the Lima with the smallest storage space. If your two Lima have very different storage sizes, the app will guide you to fix that. B: If ever there is a problem in the replication, the Lima app will warn you that your files are not backed up properly. C: Lima can work through a VPN if your router is VPN-capable and connected to this VPN. If only your computer is connected to that VPN, Lima won't work properly with your other devices. The two Limas won't replicate each other's data properly either. D: When using two Limas, the two have exactly the same data and the data is streamed from the Lima that is the closest to you. So you always get the fastest performance. E: Unfortunately, we had to close ForgetBox to focus on building Lima: that's why you'll find only old/beta binaries on the Internet. Thanks for your support! @Troy Pirschel, @Don Gateley: If you connect multiple drives to Lima, it will just add more storage to your system. As Don says, the storage is managed as a "unified pool". So when you connect a new drive to Lima, you can basically just add more files in your devices: nothing else changes about the organization of your files. @Don Gateley: Kamilah is right, your Desktop's files are synchronized by Lima. Technically, we manage your files a the file-system level. @hkg: Lima can encrypt your hard drives by itself if you ask him to. In this case, files are encrypted on your device before being sent to the Lima. If you want to use external encryption tools, you can perfectly do it. However, keep in mind that you'll only be able to open your encrypted files on the devices on which these tools are installed. @Alex Winkle: I'm going to go through your other questions, but here is about the last one: actually, Lima doesn't offload your files from your computer when you install it. All the files that were already on your computer are marked as "available-offline". So they are kept on your local hard drive, and copied to the drives of your Lima. Every time you create a new file on a given device, this file is also automatically marked as "available-offline". By default, the "online-only" files you'll see in your computer are files stored on other devices or files that don't fit in your local hard drive. That being said, you can perfectly put all your files "online-only" and see all your files on a computer that's completely empty. If some of your files are not replicated at least twice between your devices and Lima, the Lima app will warn you about it and help you select the best backup option. Hope that clarifies things a bit! @Oleksandr Markushyn: Your schema is right. You can even put your second Lima on another Home, if you want it. About question 3: Technically, Lima backs up everything but synchronizes only the user data between your devices. Every OS defines a specific folder where this data should be put: it's your "User" directory. Generally, all your files are there: from the files on your Desktop to your Downloads. And Lima synchronizes this folder. If, for some reason, you have some files at exotic places in your OS (like in a C:\Project folder), you'll have to move them either to your User directory, either on a partition we'll make available for experts. This is because we cannot decide for you where we should put these files on your other devices. Tell us if it's clear enough! Hello everybody, Sorry for our silence in the last few days. Things are moving fast around here, and we didn't even get the time to post an update. We are *incredibly* happy about reaching the million dollars raised on this campaign. We love that you are so many people supporting us and this project, and we're working day and night to make sure Lima will be perfect when you receive it. I'll try to spend more time in the next few days so all questions on this page are answered. We want to make sure everybody understands how Lima works and what they can do with it before the end of the campaign. Thanks again for being part of this! @Alex: Yes, you have two options for sharing files and folders: - Literally "sharing" a folder: you'll be able to collaborate with other people on the contents of that folder, and every time someone modifies something, it'll be synchronized with the group. (ie: cloud alike) - Literally "sending" a file or a group of files & folders: your recipients will receive a copy of the files by e-mail (via a secure/authenticated link). They'll be able to download these files, and then they'll be able to do whatever they want with them: it won't modify the original files on your computer. @Mathan Est Mort: Yes, it is CE and FCC certified. @Brandon D: Security audit of our code is a good idea. We'll think about that. About your question 1: we're currently thinking about implementing it in our advanced features. @Julius: The colored versions of Lima haven't been produced yet. But we'll send pictures as soon as we get them :) @loner1200: Oops. didn't see your comment. Thanks! @Rhaevyn Fae: Actually, the speed will depend on your provider and on where you are. We do everything to make it reasonable. For situations where streaming is a problem, the Lima app also enables you to make the movie "available offline": this way, you can watch movies even in the subway. @Back 2 Base-ix: Prior to the Chromecast integration, Lima was compatible with Wi-Fi or Ethernet connected TVs, and TVs using a connected set-top box. Now, you an use Chromecast to make Lima compatible with any TV having an HDMI port. In your situation, if you have a PC connected to your TV, then installing Lima on it will enable you to see all your movies on that PC (and by extension on your TV). @Brad Ford: Thanks! We've unlocked a stretch goal. I'll write an update about it! @Kamilah: Thanks again for your answers. They're always right. @Matheus Oosthuysen: mySkiva is the combination of a router and a NAS device. We explain the difference between Lima and a NAS device here: <url>ć: Yes, Plug will work with docking stations @janotterstetter: Thanks @Matt Burrows: No, you don't have to pay any monthly fees with Plug. You can access your data from anywhere anytime, either via your devices or via web access (can be disabled). As janotterstetter says, you can combine Plug with a remote Backup service like Backblaze or CrashPlan if you wan't to have an off-site backup of your files and trust these providers: these plans are the ones costing (less than) $5/month, for unlimited backup. They do not provide easy web access to your files (Plug does), but they are very reliable solutions for backup. @Christiaan Widdershoven: No worries on this side. We will double check your shipping address directly with you right before sending Plug to the post office. @Eric: Thanks for your support. Well, we wanted a name that underlines the simplicity of the product. In a way, "Plug" does: you just have to connect your drives, and it works :) @Clarence Wee: Yes. We explain the difference in our FAQ, there: <url>örn Ekenberg: Yes! @bobbybobbob: To follow up on your questions: 1. True. Answered below. All non-system folders in your User directory are synced by default (to be clear: we only leave the "Library" (Mac) or "AppData" (Windows) folders out to avoid corrupting data). All your other files are in Plug, but only for backup. More info in previous answer. 2. True. 3. True. We use a large part of the free storage space of your device for caching. 4. Yes. If the software used to open the file (eg: a video editor) doesn't need to read the file from end to end (just thumbnails), the file opens before being entirely transferred to your drive. 5. Depends on your connection, but mostly true. 6. Yes 7. Yes. And big files have a higher caching priority. 8. Yes, depending on what you open. 9. Yes. However, very few programs need to read an entire file before opening it. For example, a lot of video editors seek through the file to create thumbnails, without reading the file entirely. So if you open a large video, there are high chances for the video file to open promptly. In the background, Plug will transfer the entire file in your local hard drive for caching. If you're using 3G during the operation and want to open a 2GB file, Plug will warn you as opening the file can get extremely slow. It will advise you to select the file for offline viewing to make later openings significantly faster. Hope that's more clear! @janotterstetter: Yes, when connecting two or more drives to a single Plug, you'll have the option to replicate your data in a way that's equivalent to RAID-6. It'll be in the advanced parameters. @Kamilah Carter: Thanks for you comments :) and.. sure! Here is our answer: @bobbybobbob: You're right to ask for details. We'll write a FAQ answer to cover your question. In short, Plug handles the content of your User folder by default. This is because that's the folder made to contain your personal files in the three computer OSes we support: Windows, Mac OS and Linux. This folder contains the Desktop of your computers, your downloads, you documents, your music, pictures, videos... and everything you decide to put into. For the moment, all the files outside your User folder are backed up into Plug, but not synchronized explicitely with your other devices. This leaves out three types of files from default synchronization: your system files, your application files, and the files you put in custom/non-standard locations (along with system files) in your computers. - We can't synchronize your system and application files between your devices because it would corrupt your data. However, we're definitely planning to provide APIs and maybe specific application support in the future so your application get also synchronized. For these folders, Plug only provides back up, so you can get back your e-mails if your computer crashes. - Concerning your custom folders (let's say, your C:\mystuff folder), we don't synchronize them by default because we can't tell the difference between application files and a folder you've added in the C:\ directory. It would also be difficult to find the right place to put them in your other devices: Mac OS doesn't have a C:\ folder, and Linux neither. We are currently thinking about providing you with a virtual hard drive (let's say a P: "Plug" drive) -- as an expert option -- so you can have a way to synchronize the files you really can't put in your User directory. That would solve the problem while keeping Plug's usage simple, which is what we care about the most. That leads us to the subject of multiple partitions. By default, Plug doesn't enable you to synchronize multiple partitions, because that's simply against the spirit of the product: Plug's role is to unify your storage, not to keep it partitionned. If you have a D: drive containing a lot of data, Plug will enable you to move this data into your User directory, even if it didn't fit in there before. This way, you can finally have all your data at the same place. If, for some reason, you really need these files to be at the root of a partition (eg: your a developer), you'll also be able to place them in our optional P: partition, along with your other custom folders. Hope this helps! @Jonathan: Thanks for the kind words! Unfortunately, the low price of Plug (and our time schedule) don't allow us to put USB3 (and with all people asking for it, we wish we could). We explain in our FAQ why that doesn't really impact the performance of Plug, though. Here it is: <url>#project-faqs @Erwin: Yes, if your media player supports UPnP, it should be able to display the media from Plug on your TV. We are working on finding solutions for additional partitions (E:, F:, etc). Right now, Plug doesn't allow multiple partitions. It can use their storage, but it manages only the files of your user directory. However, it backs everything up. @Thomas 1. Yes, it will be possible. We'll ask your contacts to install a lighter version of our app. 2. This will be possible also, but it's kind of a hack. What are your plans? 3. We do everything to keep your data readable on your hard drives, and to use the same files/folder hierarchy as on all your devices. However, if you have multiple drives, you cannot be sure that all the contents of a folder will be stored on a single hard drive. Encryption is an option. In this case you'll need a Plug rescue app to read your data (using your password). 4. No. We prefer people to manually move their data to their computer in this case. Else it would lead to a lot of unexpected situations (eg: your client discovers that you copied all the contents of his USB key on your desktop). 5. You can access your files remotely for free. However, some people may to back up a copy of their data in a remote datacenter. You can do so thanks to external services such as BackBlaze or CrashPlan, which enable you to backup an unlimited amount of data for $5/month. @Eric Ochoa: We explain in our FAQ why putting USB3 in Plug isn't such a good idea. <url>#project-faqs In short, USB3 would make the cost of Plug jump to $200, for not so big a performance increase. In contrary to how it works when you use an external hard drive, when you read/write to Plug, Plug uses your local hard drive to cache the operations. So most of the time, reading and writing with Plug can be done at 6Gbps (Sata-3 speed). That's faster than USB3. Of course, when you stream data directly from Plug, USB3 would increase transfer speed (provided it is coupled with Gigabit Ethernet). But as long as you can stream a movie with USB2, there are no much reasons to require USB3 on a daily basis. Don't misunderstand me: we would love to put USB3 in Plug. But taking in account the little difference in usage, the $69 price point seemed much more attractive to us than going into a specs war. @bernimoses: This is clearly in our todo list. We're not sure it'll be ready by December, but we'll be working on it hard: there's absolutely no point in making people by their storage twice @Kamilah: Oops. Didn't see your answer. Thanks! @Joshy: Yes, Plug can supply enough power for one non-powered USB drive. If you need to connect more drives, you can do it thank to a powered USB hub. When your not at Home, the Plug app communicates with your Plug device thanks to a secure private network that link them both. You don't need to configure anything. If you're not on your device, you can access your data remotely thanks to our web interface (using your email, password, and optionally your phone to login). This feature can be disabled anytime. @Kamilah: Yes, Green Plugs are out! We'll let all backers select their preferred color at the end of the campaign. @Mathias: As you pointed out, the main argument for getting two Plug is to be able to put your data in multiple locations. Another advantage is that if you connect each Plug to a different Internet connection, you'll also gain in transfer speed when you're not at Home: your data will be streamed twice as fast to your devices. If you have one Plug at Home and one at your office, you'll also be sure to enjoy local network speeds both at home and at work. Hey Sebastian, It's in our plans. It may come later than Android or iPhone (because we need to prioritize according to the number of people using each platform), but it's definitely planned. We'll send all backers a survey after the campaign, to see which devices they are using. If there's a lot of Blackberries and Windows phones, we'll try to get faster on these platforms. @Martin Rudat: That's a very good idea, I'll take note and see what we can do about it. @Joan: I note your idea too. We will definitely think about this one. Paul Vincent Farrell told us about similar needs. @sean patrick steier: yes, music and video playing will be in-app. Unfortunately, Siri won' be able to control our app when it comes out. We're waiting for Apple to open an SDK.. @KMD1237: No, auto-backup won't be interrupted by Plug. Plug will just provide an additional kind of auto-backup feature of its own: everytime you'll take a picture, it'll be saved in your "Pictures" folder on all your devices. @Kamilah: Thanks again for replying so fast and so accurately to the messages on this page! @Shahab: Yes, you can disable a device anytime. We're also working on a functionality to remotely delete the content of your stolen device @Scott: We explain the difference in details in our FAQ (<url>#project-faqs) In short: The innovation in Plug is that it replaces the file system of your computers and manages your files for you. For the first time ever, all your devices have exactly the same files. So Plug is not just a place where you can put your data. It virtually replaces the memory of your devices to become their common memory. Hope it helps! @Martin Rudat: When a drive fails, the Plug apps warns you immediately. In the meantime, Plug will begin recovering your data by copying it both from your computers and from the other Plug devices you have. If you don't have enough space anymore to store this data, our app will ask you to add a new drive. We're thinking about a DLNA/UPnP server for the Plug device first (hence the compatibility with your TV). Do you think it would be helpful on the Plug app too (talking about a server, not a controller)? @Robert Hercz: Yes. If you modify only a few bytes, Plug will only transmit these few bytes on the network. Note that if some of your devices are on the same LAN, this sync will be made in P2P. @Suraj: Yes, it is. Plug works in P2P. If you don't have Internet but all your devices are on the same network, it will work. @Kamilah: You rock! Thanks again for all these responses. @bof: We've put manual folder selection aside for the moment, as the aim of Plug is to provide a solution that "just works", without any configuration involved. So no "partial" mirroring is available at the moment. When you buy 2 Plugs, all your content is mirrored. I took your comments in note, though. Thanks for bringing the point. We'll think about it when building Plug's advanced config options. @Suraj: Markus nailed it. We are too fragile as a startup to open source our code, at least now. All the innovation in Plug is software based. However, you'll still be able to analyze Plug in/out traffic: that's also a good way to make sure we don't do bad things with your data. @paul vincent farrel: That's actually a very good solution. Yes, sync programs will always continue working in the same way, no matter if you have Plug or not. @paul vincent farrel: Sorry for answering late. I've been busy responding to private messages first. Your question makes a lot of sense. So we put a mention in our FAQ yesterday to address it. In short: yes, Plug will reorganize your data in the drives you connect to it. The product is clearly not built to let you remove your drives now and then. It's built to let you connect your drives once, and forget about them. When you connect a new drive, Plug will use its storage to make you 'feel' like you can put more things in your devices. Internally, it will make an inventory of the files you have in your drive, and display them in a new folder on the Desktop of your devices. So it will not screw up the organization of your music in itself, but simply put the 'root' of your music folder/drive at a different place in your computer. Unlike what happens with products like DropBox, PogoPlug or SpaceMonkey, you can reorganize these files as you wish in your system. Under the hood, on your drive, Plug will reproduce the same files and folder struture as on all your devices (the same structure as your Home/User folder in Windows, Mac OS and Ubuntu): it will create a Documents folder, a Desktop folder, a Pictures folder, etc... So internally, your music will probably be moved to a "Desktop/SEAGATE/" folder on your drive (if your drive is named SEAGATE). if you have other drives connected to Plug, Plug might move your music in the same folder, but on other drives. Removing a drive is not a common operation. It's like removing part of the memory of your devices. So the Plug app provides you with controls that enable to remove drives properly. When you ask Plug to disconnect a drive, it will internally move all the data from this drive to the other drives connected to it. If there are no other drives connected to it, it will ask you what to do (either move the data to your devices, either keep it all on the drive). However, we DO make our best to keep the initial file system type on your drives, and to always store data in a readable format. This way, we make sure you can always recover your data in seconds, even if your Plug device breaks. It's interesting for us to get feedback on how people use their drives. If you don't mind, I'd love to keep in touch with you so we can find a way to adapt Plug to your specific use case. If you don't have enough space on your laptop to put all of your music, and above that no Internet access when you're mixing, it's better to keep using your external hard drive for mixing as you're doing today. Plug would enable you to have all your music on your laptop and iPad on the go, but it doesn't replace this specific external hard drive use case. One quick hack for you, if all your data holds in 3TB, is to get two Plug that replicate each other, with one hard drive connected to each. Because you'll have only one drive connected to each Plug, you'll be sure where your data is. And because you'll have two Plug devices, you'll be able to disconnect one of them temporarily for moments when you go mixing. But that's still a hack. I don't like that. We'll think about it on our side and try to find an elegant solution. Just added new answer to the FAQ: "(tech) Does Plug format the hard drives I connect to it? What file systems does it support?" <url>#project-faqs More answers coming soon. @Kamilah Carter: A super-HUGE-and-sincere thanks for answering to so many questions! It really helps. We love that some backers like you are so active that we feel they're part of the team. @Robert Hercz: You're asking a very good question, although very technical. The only visual part of CGC servers is to provide you a smooth Web interface to access your files *ONLY* when you're not on your devices. That's not something you may do daily, so you can disable it if you don't want our server to serve as a relay to the outside for your data. The purpose of a decentralized VPN is to make the process "Hey, where is Alice ? (or what is the IP address of Alice?)" not based on a central server, but on a decentralized network. This operation is not handled by our servers. The purpose of this paragraph is not to go into the details of such process. If you have further questions about how decentralized networks work, we invite you to read research papers about this (DHT, etc...). There are plenty on the Internet. The first configuration is performed on our website because we thought it would be easier to do. However your RSA private key ("your identity card") is generated on your side and never goes on our server. So again, we don't have a lot of information. CGC servers are just there to push updates, provide Web access if you want, and optimize some processes. We don't do a lot. They could disappear, and the network would continue to work. Hello R.M. 1. We do not format your drives, unless they're empty. We try to use their initial format as is. If they're empty or unreadable, we'll format them to Ext4 2. Yes, you can. If your Plug is in the same LAN as your devices, they will synchronize. You'll be able to send files behind an air gap. No documentation needed: it will just work. The website only serves for people who want to access their files from an Internet-enabled environment, on a computer where the Plug app isn't installed. 3. The best way is to buy two Plug: they will replicate each other's data. @Josh Arnon: To be clearer, PogoPlug and DropBox do not synchronize all your folders. They create a specific folder in your computer (either called "PogoPlug or "DropBox"). If you want to synchronize something between your devices, you have to move it manually inside this folder. With Plug, all of your files are exactly the same on all your devices. There is no need to move your files anywhere to synchronize them. So you can organize your files as you wish, and they'll organize on all your devices at the same time. You don't have to think about synchronization anymore, because it's become seemless. The typical use case: you won't ever miss this powerpoint presentation you forgot to put into DropBox before leaving Home. @shinn, @Kamilah Carter: For a more visual explanation, you can watch what happens when you install Plug here: <url>"format" of your drives for you. @Craig Dunn, @Christopher Lewis, @Ben McIntosh: That would be great, indeed, but unfortunately a lot of people do not have any open ports on their routers (nor UPnP). So we cannot always host the web interface directly on your Plug (ie: without a proxy). What we can do is to make the Plug website a shell, and to download the page contents (lists of files, thumbnails, the file themselves) thanks to the API of your local Plug app (without using the server as a relay). @Keith Rome, @Ben McIntosh: You're right. I'll add it to the page. It'll be clearer for everyone. @Josh Arnon, @Christopher Currie: That's in the works! @Christopher Currie: Your VPNs shouldn't cause any trouble. Difficult to know about the lag issues without testing, but a good lag-killer would be to get two Plug devices: one for your home in the US, one for Europe. This way, your data will be replicated (and cached) on both sides of the Atlantic. @Stephan McGowan: 1. You can play with Plug's file using cmd.exe, even if they are not locally stored on your computer (eg: you can rename/copy/edit a video stored in your My Videos folders even if it is available only in streaming). However, the folders synchronized with your other devices are only those containing user files. We do not synchronize the "Program Files" or the "Program Data" folders in Windows. The reason is simple: if you have two versions of an app on two of your computers, doing so would damage your data. 2. I encourage everybody to watch our demo screencast video. It covers the installation of Plug, so it might help you understand what happens when you install Plug. Here it is: <url>### Mobile applications >>> In response to: Benjamin Levaillant, Eric Fortin (and others) --- Android and iOS applications will be provided. WP8 should follow. They'll be obviously free. You'll be able to access and modify your files from our application, a little like you can do it today with the Dropbox app. The difference is that all your files will be there: from your “Desktop” folder to your “My Documents” folder. You’ll be able to listen to all the music from your “My Music” folder and to watch all your videos from your “My Videos” folder. Just like if you were on a PC or a Mac. Anytime, you can ask Plug to keep files or folders for offline viewing. This enables you to access/edit this file or folder even without a data connection. It works a little like Spotify or Google Music. Integration with other apps is done through the “Share” button: Plug enables you to send files to your friends in just a few clicks. When you take a picture from your smartphone or your tablet, it gets automatically uploaded to your “My Pictures” folder in Plug. We also provide a SDK to enable mobile developers to integrate our technology deeper in their apps, to provide a new set of experiences. -------------------------------------------------- ### What is actually changing on my computer. >>> In response to: Laurent Ferrante (and others) --- Plug is not a folder like Dropbox or a hard-drive like a NAS. Plug is designed to replace the memory of your devices by itself, so that all your devices will have exactly the same memory, and (by extension) the same content. So it’s like if your PC, your Mac, your smartphone and tablet had all exactly the same “hard-drive”. Plug will bring more space to your devices. You won't feel any changes. You don't need to move your files in another location: just let them where they already are, in your "My Documents", "My Pictures", "My Videos", "My Desktop" folders. Plug only manages your documents, music, pictures and videos, it ignores your applications and your systems files. -------------------------------------------------- ### Security & Cryptography used behind Plug >>> In response to: Kenneth Brook (and others) --- The following is a little techy. The last paragraph sums up. Plug uses asymmetric cryptography. When Plug is installed, the application generates a RSA-2048 pair of keys, identifiable by the user's email, and with a private key protected by the user password. This private key, which is what authenticates a user in the Plug system, is stored in your Plug and your devices. We don't know this key because we don't have your password, so we cannot - us or anyone else - steal your identity. AES is used to encrypt your files, using a key derived from your user key. When you want to access your files from the Web, we'll ask Plug if you're really you: we're just a third-party, and we’ll do the relay. Even there, we won't see any of your data as everything is encrypted. Note that the Web access can be disabled if you don't even want us to be a relay. To sum up, we developed Plug in such way that your Plug is the only one which contains your real identity card. It is impossible, even to us, to steal it. That's another reason why we are decentralized, and why we say Plug is an anti-PRISM solution: we cannot access your data, or provide the access to anyone, because the security is built this way. -------------------------------------------------- ### Specific feedbacks @Kamilah Carter: thank you for your enthusiasm and your support! We’re glad we’re your first backed project! @dutt: if Plug crashes, you can disconnect your hard-drives anytime and get back your data by connecting it on one of your computer. If you don’t want to loose your data if one hard-drive crashes, you can replicate the content over several hard-drives, or back it up over another Plug, or remotely using service like Blackbaze or CrashPlan. We don’t synchronize program or system data between your devices. Only your files. @Richard Stott: Ashish Chalke & Kamilah Carter are right about 1 & 4 ; 2: Yes, for most hard-drives ; 3: Yes -------------------------------------------------- More answers coming soon. Thanks for being so supportive, The team @Keith Rome, @Kris: The hardware Plug is based on is a bit like the Raspberry Pi. It exists for years, and has been used by various companies (including Addonics) as the base of their products -- just like other Kickstarter projects using BeagleBone or Aduino. It's called WANSER-R, and it's produced by MRT Communications, our manufacturng partner. We made the choice to base our solution on this particular hardware because MRT knows how to produce them in quantities for years. It has already been proven. So using it was a good way for us to make sure we would ship on time. Instead of building an entirely new device, we have teamed up with them to change only the necessary components inside. The price difference you can see between Plug and Addonics devices result both from this change of components and from our unability to order very large batches of devices. When you back Plug, you do not only receive a piece of dumb hardware. When you back Plug, you get a complete solution, from hardware to software, that enables you to create a completely unified memory for your devices. As underlined in our FAQ, this project goes far beyond building a simple NAS device (like the one offered by Addonics). It's the result of a team of engineers working hard for 2 years, to provide you with a powerful and viable solution.Plug creates new usages, that has never been seen in the world of consumer electronics. We are completely open to talk about this, so feel free to send you any message with your questions. We are hackers: we take things, and we modify them to do other things. In the case of Plug, we'd built something incredibly better. Hello everbody, We’ve just added 3 new answers in our FAQ. We’ll continue writing more as time goes. Don’t hesitate to leave unanswered questions here if they aren’t already on the page. (Please take the time to look for already answered questions) -------------------------------------------------- ### What happens if CGC dies ? >>> In response to: Adrian C, Christopher Coleman, Derek Mitchell, Pierre Collignon (and others) --- What’s good with Plug is that it’s entirely private and decentralized. So Plug can work independently from any servers, and continue managing your data even if our startup dies (disclosure: we don’t plan anything like that). The only thing we manage on our side of the equations are updates of our app and the web interface of Plug. In case of company crash, we’ll do our best to open source at least the most critical parts of our code, so the community continues improving the solution every night. -------------------------------------------------- ### Will you put stretch goals? >>> In response to: Adrian C, Benjamin Lebsanft, <email>, Deepra Smith, Kenneth Brook (and others) --- We already gave insights on this one, but here is a more complete answer: "You also asked us about improvements, stretch goals, ... We need to deeply think about the implications of such choices before giving you a proper answer. We won't tell you ‘yes, we'll do it’ without *really* knowing if we are able to. Answering you too fast would not be serious.” You gave us very interesting advices through this forum and via privates messages: USB3, Gigabit Ethernet, pledge discounts, multi-USB ports, free shipping, color options, a dock, a future discount for future versions of Plug. Some of these ideas are awesome. We’d love to receive more. We’re thinking hard about what would be best for this campaign, but we can't tell you yet if we'll offer stretch goals or not. Our secret is that we don't want to make the production late because of additional goals. We’ll do our best. -------------------------------------------------- ### IP address resolving and VPN >>> In response to: Deepra Smith, DURANDET Alexandre, janotterstetter (and others) --- This paragraph is a little technical. Feel free to ignore. As mentioned, each one of your devices is connected to a decentralized P2P VPN. Every "Plug"-ed device is given a unique name, a little like a domain name. Each device has to announce to the network its name and how to be contacted. And when another device wants to talk with it, it asks to the decentralized network how to reach it. So, Plug works even if you don’t have a static IP. The VPN is made to handle this common situation. If two "Plug"-ed devices want to talk with each other, and are on the same network, the transfer will be done locally, without going through the Internet. That's why transfers are faster when you're connected to the same LAN than the Plug. Please be aware that most of the VPN solutions have a "star topology” (ie OpenVPN), meaning there's a central server somewhere which relays all traffic. This is not something which can be done with Plug, as we do *not* want to manage your traffic, for security reasons. -------------------------------------------------- ### Advices about PR & Communication >>> In response to: Court, Deepra Smith, KRIS & W Henry (and others) --- You are right. We thought we could handle the private messages wave then go on the forum. We spent these days full-time on the private messages, without taking really care of here. We are currently crunching all the questions we've been asked privately and on this forum to produce a more complete FAQ. This may, as you suggested, decrease the count of questions. Thanks a lot for you support and for helping us with this campaign. It’s a great week for us and we’re glad you’re part of it. -------------------------------------------------- ### More specific questions @Flament Adrien: sorry, we're not sure we understood your question. What kind of stickers are you talking about. When you mention "custom devices", do you mean the blue Plug ? @Praveen Reddy: yes, the CPU is x86 compatible @Nathan Miller: Yes, that’s one of the purposes of Plug! :-) @Fritz D: about your question “500GB of unique user data on your PC + 500GB of unique user data on your Mac + a 1TB Plug”. Yes, your Plug will be full when installed. @Christopher Coleman: you wanted to know if your hidden file will be synced (‘.*’). Yes. @Martins Mozeiko: you wanted to know if cmd.exe will work over Plug. Yes, we _really_ make your computer believe Plug is now its storage. -------------------------------------------------- ### Finally, To: Alex Dana, Cameron, Christopher Lewis, Court, DURANDET Alexandre, David Strogen, Deepra Smith, Fritz D, Hebert, Ivan Duka, Jeff Galan, KRIS, Lydie MECHINAUD, Robert Fonti, Romain Cochet, Sylvia Silberger, janotterstetter, seisen ivan, shinn.... and to all of you, backers: THANK YOU! You really contribute making Plug happen and we cannot be more happy. Your support is much appreciated. Please be patient. More answers are coming! Best, The team @Deepra Smith: Done. Thanks. We're approaching "sold out" status. We've just decreased the number of available BACKUP rewards by 100, and increased the number of CLASSIC rewards by 200. (Cannot increase the total number of Plug devices for now) Heys guys, We're in the process of populating our FAQ and answering most of this page's comments in a synthetic way. Here is an explanation about why Plug doesn't have USB3 -- one of the hottest topics. We'll add it to the FAQ. Tell us what you think! ### USB3, Thunderbolt, eSATA or Gigabit Ethernet >>> In response to: To Alan Elkaim, Ashish Chalke, Benjamin Levaillant, Chow Choong Hoe, Deepra Smith, Elliot Richards, Eric Fortin, Ethan Illfelder, idntt, Ivan Duka, Jacob Tyler Abercrombie, Jamie Heuze, janotterstetter, Jason, Kevin, Roman Kadlec, Sanjay, Shane Kenneth Donovan, shinn, Simon Harris, steven wyatt, Tomasz Fiedoruk (and others) --- We got loads of requests for putting USB3 and Gigabit ethernet in Plug, and we've serioulsy taken them into account. We'd love to do it, because USB3 transfer speed makes everybody dream. And we can't miss a chance to make you happy. However, two thing worry us: 1. First, for a small startup like us -- producing *only* (wooohooo!) 5,000 devices, putting USB3 and Gigabit ethernet would make Plug a -least- 2.5x more expensive than what it is today. You Plug would cost you around $200. In fact, putting USB3 is not just about changing the USB port: it's about redesigning the electronics inside Plug and changing every component inside. It would also make manufacturing far more expensive for us. 2. Second, even if USB3 would make you Plug device faster, we're not sure you'll feel a big enough difference when using our solution. Here are some explanations (let's go a bit technical): When you connect an external USB hard drive directly to your computer, data is written directly on this drive everytime you modify or copy a file on it. So everythime you press "save" when editing a big file, your computer waits for the data to be transferred to your drive. This process was quite slow when using USB2: 480Mbps. USB3 is 5Gbps, or about 10x faster. That's why in this configuration, it makes a lot of sense. However, when you connect your drive to Plug the process is different: To avoid performance problems, we just apply a very simple rule: we keep temporary local copies of the files you use the most in your local drives (if possible). It means that when you ask for a file, your device will check if it doesn't have a temporary local copy of it. This is named "caching", and we do a lot! All these operations are transparent to you, the user. So when you save a file, the data will be temporary stored on the local hard-drive/flash of your device. This is a very fast operation. In fact, the hard drives inside your computer use SATA3 to communicate with your system. SATA3 is 6Gbps: it's 20% faster than USB3! Of course, we *do* need to transfer these files to your Plug afterwards. But this second part is completely asynchronous: it's done in the background, so you won't feel it as a user. It *will* take some time, but as the file is already saved (at the opposite of what happens when you use a regular USB hard-drive), you won't have to wait for the writing to be done: so it doesn't matter that much. Due to the small perceived difference between using USB2 or USB3 in the Plug device, we've opted for a USB2 design. Thanks to this choice, we could make Plug far more affordable. Our philosophy at CGC is to build devices with the best perceived performance as possible. Not to sell you big specifications that would make you pay more without being worth it. Behind the curtains, we are thinking for ways to intoduce interesting stretch goals improving the device. Feel free to react. We'd like to hear your arguments. More answers coming asap today. Hi everybody! We really want to thank you all, for your Kickstarter's private messages, messages of the forum, mails and comments on other social media. It is incredible to share & debate with you about what we developed for so many months. We're realizing now that our public communication on this forum may be a little ... "light". We are sorry about that. Since the beginning of the campaign, we decided to answer the Kickstarter private messages in priority, and in order. We received hundreds of your questions, feedbacks, and we really wanted to give each of you a personal answer. We received more mails than we could answer per day. This takes a LOT of time, and we're doing our best to be faster. You also asked us about improvements, stretch goals, ... We need to deeply think about the implications of such choices before giving you a proper answer. We won't tell you "yes, we'll do it" without *really* knowing if we are able to. Answering you too fast would not be serious. We are a garage start-up : we worked so hard these months, we sacrificed our life to Plug. You cannot imagine how great it is to read your questions, feedback, advises! We need them! It'll be a pleasure to answer you all. So please, be patient! We will answer every single messages, and also on the public forum. We're living an amazing journey, and we're glad you're now part of it! So, again, Thank you. Hi there, I thought it would be good to clarify a bit how Plug synchronizes your files. Here are the main points: - Our job with Plug is to display exactly the same files on all of your devices. We want your files to be attached to you, and not to your devices. In other words, we'd like to enable you to always manipulate the same content, no matter which device you're using. To our eyes, manual synchronization is a worry. - Of course, your devices have different storage capacities. So we only use their internal hard drives as a cache. All your files will be displayed, but only some of them are stored locally. It works a bit like Spotify: when you're online, you can open any file - it's just feel like your device has no more limits of size. When you're offline, you can see only the files you selected for offline viewing. In Plug world, selecting which files you want to view when offline - on each device - is a bit like selecting what folders you want to synchronize in today's world. Except that in Plug's case, you can make this choice directly in your OS by right clicking on your files. There's no complex interface to play with. - In some situations, you might want to have different files in two devices. It can be the case if you have a work computer and a personal computer. We're working on solutions so you can split these two "universes", and select whether you want to see your "Pro" files or your "Personal" files on each device. Don't hesitate to message us directly. We'd be glad to give you more details. Thanks for your suport! Quick replies while on the go: @Alen: I've edited the FAQ to avoid confusion. Thanks for bringing in these precisions. We *do* believe that synchronization is simpler when the entire filesystem is synchronized. What about exchanging around that by e-mail? We've followed your campaign from our cave and we'd love to meet you. @Fritz: Plug synchronizes all your files (documents, pictures, music, videos), but you can select which ones are available offline (ie take storage space) on your device, and which ones should be available only in streaming from your Plug. Note that specific application data, such as iOS Contacts or Notes, are not currently synchronized in the current version of Plug. We'll do our best to support these specific applications soon in the future. @Jan: Plug stores everything in a readable format on your drive. So if anything goes wrong, you'll be able to get your data back in seconds -- even if your Plug is broken. Hi everybody, Thanks for being so much to talk about Plug. It really helps us. We've begun fulfilling the project FAQ with the main questions in this thread: <url>#project-faqs We explain the difference between Plug and PogoPlug/OwnCloud/Synology/DropBox. We also provide details about multi-user support and shipping. I'll do my best to answer to your other comments asap. We don't sleep a lot these days, and we love how much people support us. Thanks for your exhaustive feedback! Hello everybody, We received a LOT of questions from you. Thank you for your support! We're working full-time to give you all the more precise & dedicated answers we can. We try to answer personally every-single-question, so it takes a bit of time. You cannot imagine how great it is to talk with you about Plug. Thank you so much for being here! Hello everybody, We're sorry about the confusion around shipping prices. We thought it would better to offer Plug at the exact same price for everyone (intl/US). As we're both US and Europe based, it's something we can do. We cannot remove the shipping fees. We've done great efforts to make Plug affordable, so removing $10 more will not work in our manufacturig plan. However, we'll include these $10 in the next rewards to come so everything is clear and without surprises (can't change the current ones). Thanks for your understanding! Hi everybody, Thanks for your tremendous support! We can't believe it! It's great! We're a bit underwater, but here is a quick answer to the main questions: - Shipping: we DO ship internationally. We put $10 for everyone. Please add it to your pledge when backing (I guess you'll be able to add it later if you already backed us) - USB3 & Gigabit Ethernet: that would be awesome, indeed, but it would have made the device far more expensive for us to produce (and we don't like that - we want it cheap and sexy). Moreover, with Plug, the memory of your devices is used as cache. So this is not really a bottleneck: in most situations, having USB2 instead of USB3 shouldn't really impact the user experience. - Ethernet instead of Wi-Fi: for reliability and performance. Also, your Plug should be connected to your router all the time. There is no point in putting it too far. - For people who have a NAS (Synology, etc...): we'll try to make Plug compatible with SAMBA in the future. That would enable you to re-use the storage you already bought with your devices. Which is something we find important. - Hard drive arrays: data replication is high in our priority list. If you connect two hard drives to Plug (using a USB hub), you'll be able to have them replicate each other. - EARLY BIRD and CLASSIC are exactly the same, except for the color (all gone -woah) - When you take a picture with your phone, it gets copied on Plug automatically. It stays available on your phone, but it also appears in the "My Pictures" folder of your PC and of your other devices. If you have a connected TV, it gets available there too. We can't thank you enough for how GREAT this launch has been. You are awesome. Don't hesitate to share the projects to your friends!
