Quick note: Lawrence let us know that he and his team need a few extra days to complete the "before and after" watch case design document (i.e. a few days beyond this weekend). For those who were looking to dig into details of the changes made since the fit-validation watch case samples, please accept our apologies for this delay. I still expect the watch case design work to be completed by end-of-September so we can get samples/molds ordered by 1-Oct-2014. -- Chris @Marco Morbin -- we'll be posting updated images and details in the Kickstarter Updates. As a company, we have copyright legal issues which require that we receive the photos and updates from House of Horology directly so that we have posting rights -- so these photos are typically posted as part of our detailed "Updates page" process. The design team has really accelerated their photography the last few weeks and we should be getting a lot of great photos to share... We'll be showing off their work; no worries about that. Quick update: we had a fairly thorough status call yesterday, much of it centering around updated timelines. Anthony (HoH project manager) and I were representing Secret Labs and Lawrence was representing the watch case design team. The watch case design team is wrapping up the watch case right now and expects to have completed all but one CAD design issue within the week. There are some additional issues getting material data sheets, supply issues, etc. and there is one mechanical design issue remaining--but as far as the physical design the team is comfortable with the design. A few quick notes: 1. The watch case design team is working through the options for mechanical interconnect between the watch case pushers and the smart movement (PCB) inside the case. We designed the movement so that it can accommodate or be easily modified for everything from pushers to side plating (for direct pusher contact or buffered pusher contact or metal flanges that are themselves buttons)...so we have a lot of flexibility to fit into the mechanical interface that the team designs. We expect all of the watch case design work to be completed by the end of September, at which point we can either order new fit validation samples or move directly to molds. The design team is also putting together updated prices for the watch cases to get us the best materials within our fairly large $25/watch-parts budget. We'll be able to narrow down the case material selection (from primarily premium polymers and ceramics) so that we make the proper kinds of molds and will be able to update our official estimated schedule based on the lead times of the molds and samples. It appears that the mold and sample process will take about 60-75 days (vs. the ~30 days it took for the last batch of CNC samples), so it may make the most sense to move directly to molds. We'll be relying on the expertise of the watch case team to make that call shortly. One final note: this spring, House of Horology switched watch ODMs and we effectively started over the 45-60 day process of moving the watch case from prototype to sample. I brought an MBA, Anthony, on-board to make sure that House of Horology and their new design team at Winson got the support they needed and the organizational focus to move the watch case to completion efficiently. That process appears to be winding down now, and Anthony will be wrapping up his work this month as well. He has done a great job coordinating between Secret Labs, me and the House of Horology+Winson design team these last few months and has spent a lot of early mornings and days providing a lot of support for this project--and I personally want to give him a huge thank you for his amazing work. The design team will be turning in design details later this week detailing the differences between the first fit-validation samples and the new samples, identifying each issue that they discovered and how they were remedied. Some of these were covered in update #22--and we'll roll the remaining updates into update #23. I know that our team is way over our estimated dates on the physical parts for this project and I really appreciate the generous patience of our backers. As we receive watch cases we will expedite the final integration stage and share details of that process so we can all get this cool new smartwatch technology and product into production together. Chris P.S. Thank you to all the backers who have reached out with offers of help and expressions of support. We're very blessed to have such a great group of backers. I'm humbled by your kindness. Typo correction: These numbers do not include any of the watch case or other mold fees, engineering or management costs, etc. For those of you who like numbers, here is a recent budget update for the physical rewards. We already purchased a lot of these parts last year in anticipation of November 2013 production (including lots of extras of some components). This is a level of pricing detail that is usually very confidential--but we wanted to share it in the spirit of Kickstarter. We do have agreements in place which prohibit us from sharing costs of specific parts. If we have any supply analysts amongst us who want to drill down they will probably enjoy estimating the breakdown. :) AGENT Smartwatch (AGENT001): $118.34 each NOTE: the design team is currently working on pricing; current estimates put this quite a bit higher. This amount is with aggressive volume discounts. Custom Qi travel chargers: $25.57 each Shipping: $15.00-$20.00 each (averaged between international and domestic USPS shipments; may end up being higher based on packaging volume) And another interesting number... Estimated certification costs: $75,000 These numbers do not include any of the watch case fees, mold fees, engineering or management costs, etc. Quick interim update: the design team made a design change to the watch case bezel this week which creates a cutout for the display's cable. I understand that we may have made additional changes to the interior bezel wall as well but the design team has not yet submitted updated design drawings. We have also made a lot of progress on selecting a site for the AGENT fulfillment/service center. This is a fairly involved project that is taking a few months to complete; I am looking forward to taking some photos soon as we get things set up. With AGENT, we have undertaken a sophisticated technology project together. As the watch case design gets completed, we can wrap up final integration and move into certification testing and production. We can dig into the operation of the AGENT fulfillment/service processes. And we can get physical rewards out to our very awesome backers. Thank you for making this all possible, -- Chris @Simon -- I do not understand all the anger, but I still appreciate you supporting our project. I do not expect you to react kindly to my gratitude or believe it to be sincere. I assume that you are posting largely out of frustration and/or misinformation. I hope to one day be able to share some happy moments with you as well, to balance things a bit. @Roma -- that's some great ASCII art. Thank you for sharing that (as art). @Roma -- regarding budget: for the AGENT Smartwatch project so far, we have paid over $60,000 to House of Horology. We have additionally spent more than $40,000 supporting the watch design team, in mold and sample fees, in supply chain research for the watch case, etc. This amount of investment far exceeds the design and mold fees quoted to us by leading Asian watch ODMs (who make watches for major US watch brands) but our hope and expectation is that this up-front investment (plus the additional revenue HoH expertly negotiated for and can earn based on timely delivery and excellent work) will bring our project a great watch case with high quality. Thank you for helping encourage the HoH+Winson design team, rather than tearing them down. I am not interested in throwing team members under the bus, and I thank you for your kindness and support. @Christopher Hammond -- regarding timelines: the Secret Labs team is currently doing design and engineering work on what will become AGENT OS v2.0 in parallel to the seemingly-mountainous task of getting the space set up for what will be the AGENT warranty/service/fulfillment center as well as management, backer engagement and more. Most of the remaining hardware work and related final integration work on our project has dependencies on the watch case being completed. Last week I asked our team for status and updated estimated timelines on completion of the watch case so that we can update the remainder of our timeline. House of Horology e-mailed their SL project manager on Friday morning promising an update within 24 hours. We have not received that update four days later. Both their project manager and I called into this morning's regularly-scheduled conference call and waited for 30 minutes but no representatives from the HoH team joined in. The delay on the timeline and status updates may be in part due to HoH's travels back from the annual HKTDC Hong Kong Watch & Clock Fair. I am working with our watch case design team to get an updated schedule and hope to be able to update backers on the larger overall schedule this week. If I do not receive an updated timeline from the design team then I will assign them one and we can work off of that. @Mehmed Bayram -- from Chris -- our team is made up of managers, electrical/software/industrial/mechanical engineers, watch designers and more. It takes quite a few people with various skills to put a huge project like this together. I do not deserve credit for all their hard work, and I am grateful for the work the team is putting in to get the AGENT Smartwatch onto the production line. @Mehmed Bayram -- from Chris: we try to ensure that all information we present here on Kickstarter is accurate. We're human and not infallible, so I can't promise we'll ever need to correct ourselves. Stay tuned to our Kickstarter Updates; you'll find official and accurate info on the project there. Are we experiencing delays on the road to production? Yes. But we set out to build something great together, and we're continuing down that path. Our project team knows that I and backers expect a lot of them; I am confident that the resulting physical rewards will be worthy of the journey, regardless of challenges along the way. @Rogers Pessin -- I personally apologize for the delays on this project and I sympathize with your frustration. I can assure you that our team is busy pushing the AGENT Smartwatch into production, albeit much slower than we anticipated. I am very proud of what our engineers put together (expeditiously even, as you can see from the first few months of project updates) and I expect that we will be able to collectively be proud of the finished product as well. I look forward and will continue pushing our team to get into production--and really appreciate both your support and patience as we get to that finish line. -- Chris @Matthew Searle -- to clear up any confusion, we have several conference calls between Secret Labs and House of Horology every week. While the watch case portion of this project is a minority piece of the overall work product, it is very important and we want to make sure they are well supported as they do their magic. We even assigned a project manager to provide support to the design team earlier this year. We are deeply engaged with the watch case design team and House of Horology is busily working with their subcontractor Winson Watch to get things hammered out. I know that the delays are frustrating, but any rumors that our team members are not working on the watch case and strap regularly are inaccurate. Things are moving along, and I will continue pushing our team to wrap things up with high-quality and professionalism. I only care about success. I want to see physical watch rewards shipping very soon, and I want them to be products that we can all be proud of. @Alex -- we're here for you, responding to a lot of PMs from backers, and working to get AGENT ready for production. Part of our team is in Hong Kong this week and there is a lot of activity going on getting the watch cases wrapped up. I expect to have some official updates soon for backers and am looking forward to getting these units into production with your support. Thank you, sincerely, for your enthusiasm. Simon -- I'm out of office traveling on business this week (including AGENT work), but am logging in from Wifi on the road to post a quick response. It is important to make a few things very clear. First of all, our goal has always been to deliver rewards by last December. As you can see from the first few months of posts, we spent a ton of time and money pushing the hardware development to get the project completed quickly. The second-hand reports I'm seeing here contain a lot of inaccuracies. As project manager for the whole project and team leader over the entire team, I'm not interested in tearing down any of our team members. What I am interested in is success. Delays on this project are costing us significantly. They're extremely frustrating to us--and I can tell that long delays are frustrating to you too. It is true that process and organizational requirements of hardware R&D may frustrate some people and may be perceived as "delays"--but that should be far offset by the benefits of being organized and building a product which is mass-manufacturable, high-quality, and worthy of our collective pride. Let's root for the team to succeed and get this project wrapped up; let's move the wearables industry forward together. As frustrating as it may be to watch the process from the outside, and as much as presumably all of us want to see this product shipped already, we are building something great here together. From Chris -- sorry for any drama today, everyone. It sounds like it was a very emotionally stressful day, especially for the watch case design team. [I understand that they ended the day on a high note, with kudos for the case back revisions and a lot of action by the design team on the bezel.] I haven't been able to catch up on all the comments, but as someone mentioned we did bring an MBA on board earlier this year to help provide support and organizational assistance to the watch case team. Our internal management has an average of three conference calls a week with House of Horology. I was not scheduled for last Friday's conference call, but I followed up earlier today with our HoH Project Manager and have asked to be scheduled onto a call in the next few business days so I can understand any frustration that came out of last week and help Lawrence feel our appreciation for his and his team's efforts. It is true that we have asked the watch case team to create something great--which they have expressed both their desire and willingness to do. Some days there's a lot of corresponding stress. They're a mix of creative and technical types--and stress can be crippling for some while being empowering for others. I hope that we, as a community, can offer them our encouragement and appreciation to help reduce the stress level. We all want to build a great smartwatch. We all want the watch case design team to succeed. And we all want great physical rewards for backers. Onward. A few quick updates to keep backers in the loop... We received the first silicon rubber production samples this month, in a variety of colors. A number of issues have been fixed since the previous run and the stitching is looking pretty great, but there are a few issues remaining. We'll include some photos and more details in this weekend's Update #22 over on the Updates page. We also got a big update from the watch case design team (House of Horology + Winson Watch) this week, indicating that they've remedied issues from the previous production samples. We'll include more details about that in this weekend's Update #22 as well. Thanks to everyone for their patience while our team gets the watch case and watch strap design issues hammered out. @Giovani Delgado -- from Chris -- to clear up any confusion regarding AGENT and Windows Phone 8.1 Update 1 (which is currently in developer preview): we're really excited about what the Windows OS team has built and we are taking advantage of many of its exciting new "wearable companion" features. Secret Labs staff have been working with Microsoft platforms for a really long time and we've gotten to know a lot of people in Redmond over the years. We work with Microsoft teams (including notably our collaborations on embedded platforms)--and when asked we provide feedback on wearables, IoT, etc. Microsoft seems to be committed to being both engaged and a thought leader in the IoT space; I've been pretty impressed with the work they've been doing this last year or so. Quick update from Chris: the case design team watch gurus (House of Horology + Winson) have been working on the fixes for the watch case and seem to be getting close to wrapping things up. We are coordinating for an update, for drawings of the final proposed fixes, etc. in the next few days. I'll include the latest news in the August Kickstarter Update. On another big topic: to prepare for production we've spent much of the last few weeks looking at spaces for AGENT final assembly, testing and warranty/service work. It won't be a huge space, but it should work efficiently for our initial requirements; we're looking at about 1,000 square feet of space in total. Unfortunately a lot of the spaces we've been looking at only have standard commercial doors which aren't quite wide enough for loading in some of the equipment we need for final assembly and testing, but we've found a few potential gems and have a few final spaces to explore in the next two weeks. As we get set up, I can take photos to share. Also, regarding the third watch case sample... We never did receive it from China (which really frustrates me, since we paid both for it and for its FedEx Express delivery). Apparently the sample's parts were made though--although not shipped to us. So the good news there is that the design team is using that sample to do some CNC edits on it to test out the design fixes. Once those are completed and validated, we can double-check all the revised drawings, technical specs and material datasheets and then do final fit-validation. @spaztastic -- just to be clear, the fit-validation samples are just for fit validation and preliminary testing. They are not marketing photos of a finished product. @Jorge -- there is a large gasket sealed between the case and case back which provides a pressure seal. @Ovsep Ambartsumyan -- please, no hammers. If you don't want your reward for some reason we'll help find it a good home. I know that the delays are frustrating--but we wanted to share the news with you as it is, not as we wish it was. We're aiming for better news in the next update. @Jeffry Moore -- we filmed videos of the original prototypes running apps that backers had created, during the Kickstarter fundraising video. The original prototypes are beat up and it might take some work to get them working with our developer tools again (which evolved since then), but if you really want us to pull those out for videos we can find some time to do so and do that again. We were pretty thorough with videos of apps, Bluetooth, etc. -- including demos and coding sessions in front of crowds and with code written by 3rd-parties. Head over to our Facebook page and scroll way down if you'd like to watch. @Matthew Searle, @Daniel Jeantou -- metal straps can create weird issues with the Qi charging. It may be possible--but it won't be an option with the watches themselves. Leather or silicon rubber are options though. @Pekka Niskanen -- quite a few watches cost less than $50 to build (and retail for up to $300, at a 500% watch industry markup). In our case we're currently more than double that, and would be in the $600+ price category if MSRP wasn't based on slimmer consumer electronics margins. @spaztastic -- from Chris -- frustrating, yes. BTW, the middle stainless steel samples (for backlight fit validation) were made in the USA, by Proto-Mold. But for the fit-validation watch cases it makes sense to use the actual watch case manufacturer so they can work out any issues; we also reduce risk for production molds that way. @Jason Mauer -- glass is a premium case back material for watches. A lot of expensive watches have glass backs (or glass windows, sometimes mated with screws). We're trying to avoid the "cheap plastic back" look that most smartwatches have. That special glass is pretty pricey. @Richard Pope -- thank you very much for your post. @Roma -- science note: ceramics is a class of materials. We're looking at options there and premium options in the polymer class as well. @Trogdor -- from Chris: glad to have you as a backer. Please don't burninate any watches; Lithium batteries and fire don't mix. @Andreas B.Hansen -- the Windows Phone support on AGENT is best-in-class. We're working on an even deeper level of .NET + WP integration for AGENT OS vNext, although that's not scheduled for release soon. @Matthew Lawrence -- the fit-validation watches are thicker than spec. For production we'll slim that down. More details in Update #21. @Ian Smith -- sorry for the delays. Our team is working to get this wrapped up. Thank you for your patience. @Chris Jutting -- thanks for the sanity check :) @Daniel Chang -- the light guide film supplier wasn't able to get their tech working within three months of our deadline, so we moved to the next best option (which ended up being a nicer design in some ways than the light guide film). @Christopher Meier -- we're posting smaller updates here, in between the bigger Updates page updates. We could have made that smaller update the "big monthly one" but we wanted to get the big news--the watch case samples--the messaging priority. We'll try to roll the smaller updates into other big updates where it makes sense to do so. Thanks for following along with the mini-updates; please continue providing us with your feedback. Much appreciated. @Richard -- sorry for the extra delay on today's update. Hopefully the depth of content helped make up for any wasted time refreshing yesterday. @Brandon Middleton -- from Chris: most respectfully, please keep the discourse civil :) I don't mind taking (verbal) beatings on behalf of the project, but some other backers may feel uncomfortable hanging out here when things get downright un-civil (as expressed by quite a few backers the last few weeks). We appreciate that you're a backer of our project and we hope we can change your mind about the negatives. @Dave VanderWekke -- thanks again for taking time for dinner a while back. It was nice meeting your wife. You're a pretty swell husband to take such an interest in her interests :) @Daniel Chang -- to clear up any misinformation...the charger has been done since last year. We did pre-Qi testing on it over half a year ago. The hardware work being done now is mostly to wrap up the watch case and then respin the smart movement as necessary to fit that final watch case. We designed all the core hardware quite a while ago at this point. @Matthew Searle -- not to beat a dead horse, but to be clear: we built smart movements based on the core design for the electronics a year ago. We built devboards using similar circuitry before the Kickstarter campaign even began--on which we ran real apps from backers during the campaign. It is true that we have hit some bumps in the road, but the technology integration was done very early on in this project. @Matthew Searle -- regarding post-delivery support: once we start shipping AGENT Smartwatches to consumers, we'll start making a profit. With profit we can hire people to write new code. Right now we're doing some of this on a shoestring budget, so it will be good to start selling watches at some point and having a real budget to do that with. @Pekka Niskanen -- as you surmised, the AGENT Smartwatch is really expensive to manufacture compared to other smartwatches. We're really close to having to raise the MSRP beyond $249 and working hard to keep that price point. Watch cases are a big part of that cost (and Lawrence has been doing a lot of negotiating on price recently...thank you Lawrence). In essence, our smartwatch costs more to build than some smartwatches sell for at retail (after 150% markup). Chris @Wayne Daniells -- we like both you and Daniel Chang. Discourse is good. Misinformation is bad. Thank you both for your support and for your participation here in the Comments section as well. @Maaz Mansori -- from Chris: thanks for sticking up for your fellow backers. We don't agree with everything Roma says, but being called Hitler is definitely over the line. Hitler was one bad dude. @Dominic -- we included more photos in the latest update. If you liked those, please let us know and we'll keep snapping photos. @Matthew Searle -- we don't want to rule out any materials until our tests are complete (which requires real molds, which are made after the fit-validation samples are approved). We've seen too many Kickstarter projects make commitments to things only to find out that they didn't work out later and disappoint backers--or something better is possible but some backers are really in love with the lesser choice. We want to have good data (and good pricing data) before we make those final calls. @Ben Norris -- was there something in the original pitch that we said was done--but wasn't actually done? We tried to be very clear; I apologize if there was any miscommunication there. I know that while we got off to a great start crossing off milestones things have slowed down with the custom components; custom components are rough that way--although few of us would have guessed that there would be this much work required to get them into production. We're really sorry about the delays there, and I'm pushing the team pretty darn hard to get the final details wrapped up. @Rick Wicker: "I'd avoid hanging out with people who asked how much my watch costs." Good point. :) @Richard -- to be clear, the Qi charger design was wrapped up last year. And the first production-quality smart movements were built last summer. The reason you aren't seeing a bunch of charger updates is because, well, it's been ready for production for a while now. It works really well, actually. @IOso -- that's what we're here for! Thanks for the PM and the thank you note. @jafrederick -- from Chris -- we're really sorry about the delays. I'm pushing the team pretty hard (some days almost to the breaking point it seems) and hope to have some more good news for you soon. @Alex J -- great points; thanks :) @Robert Holbert -- the goal is to get accurate information to backers while enabling our team members to do their jobs effectively. Roma and Adam just ask lots of questions, as was requested by other backers, and share what they find interesting. @Chucky -- did we get your PMs answered? I believe we are caught up on PMs. @Richard -- that's some pretty awesome ASCII art :) @Daniel Chang -- interestingly, as you probably guessed, the electronics that go into the watch are still pretty darn expensive a year later. I think they may have dropped by 1%, maybe. Like you guessed, we're using nice components that don't drop off in price quickly, and the microcontrollers and screens and light sensors and more that we're using remain best-in-class. @Daniel Chang -- we can only link Facebook personal accounts to Kickstarter, not Facebook Pages. Unless something has changed. If so...we'd love to do so. @Bram Ueffing -- thanks for the kind words! @Tomasz Mikolajewski -- thank you for your post. Please keep providing us with feedback, good or bad. :) @Brandon Middleton -- how can we be of assistance? @Kueh -- the screws in the case back shouldn't dig into your arm. Screws are used frequently with watch cases; it shouldn't be a problem. @Richard -- glass is a great material because it's not a major allergy concern, it's significantly more premium than plastic, and it's printable and etchable. A lot of nice watches use glass. In our case we're using it as an accent instead of a window. @Dheepak Kanagavel -- we're posting mini-updates once a week or so here on the Comments page. Let us know what you'd like us to focus on in our updates. @Maaz Mansori, @Chris Jutting, J., IOso -- thank you very much for your posts. @Brandon Middleton, @Pekka Niskanen -- to be clear, Adam and Roma are just asking us lots of questions and sharing what they find interesting with backers. Because other backers asked them to. It's that simple. @Kueh -- our plan for the back glass is to paint it with black on the inside and then add branding to the wrist-facing side. We'll be testing a few different methods for printing the latter. @Richard -- if they don't work out, we'll move to another material option. We're sharing both successes and failures here. @Alex J -- the watch internals don't fit in the first validation samples, so we'll do the pressure testing without the internals inside. We can test with pressure machines that don't use water--so it's safe to test either way. @Michael -- that offer is not endorsed by or part of this project. There's no reason someone can't offer someone else a good deal on something outside of our project though. @DigitalPH -- thank you very much for your post. @BarryKingLive -- thank you very much for your kind note! We'll be happy to continue with the mini-updates as long as you all find them useful. @Mirco Klein -- thank you for your post and perspective. @Matthew Searle -- the original plan (with $100K) was to build a pretty simple smartwatch. Most of that base watch continues to exist (in the watch case design, the backlight, etc.) but additional funds allowed us to reach for nicer materials, start work on AGENT OS vNext and more. These watches are super-expensive and we didn't build some big profit margin into the campaign so $1 million didn't give us a huge payroll budget--but it is allowing us to make the AGENT Smartwatch even nicer. @fmotta -- we'll try to roll up the mini-updates (especially the critical ones) into the big updates on the Updates page. We're trying to provide more info without flooding inboxes. I know that it's not perfect, and we'll keep tweaking our strategy to try to get you more info more frequently. @Matthew Searle -- right now we're focused on pressure testing the watch seals, pushers, etc. Once we have watch cases made in the target material candidates, we will pressure test those as our final validation. Right now we're just trying to head off any potential issues; there's no sense in waiting to pressure test individual parts that are done now in case there are issues. @Michael -- from Chris -- for the most accurate information on the project, please PM @creator or post here. If you'd like details on the charger (which we wrapped up last year), we included lots of those in updates #15 and #!6. Those chargers have been done for a very long time. @Srihari Paulsamy -- if you hold down your backlight for hours, your battery life will drain pretty quickly. We can run some "typical" scenarios once everything is finalized but if battery life is an extreme concern you can always turn off your backlight. @Dino -- thank you for the feedback. We spent quite a bit of time taking photos which detailed our current status in Update #21, and I'll see if we can shoot some videos as well. Please let us know how we're doing, and we'll try to bring you more of what you want. Thank you! @spaztastic -- thank you for the kind note. I'm glad that this last month's mini-updates were what you were looking for, at least initially. Did we continue doing a good job along that path? We're continually tweaking our communication strategy to try to provide the best info and best backer engagement we can while still pushing this project forward to production. Your feedback is not only appreciated; it is invaluable. Thank you. Quite update: House of Horology has submitted their full analysis of the watch case fit-validation samples and they found issue(s) that need to be addressed with the watch case manufacturer. We are combining their completed list with notes from the engineering team. Lots more details coming in Kickstarter Update #21 (which should be posted this weekend). Thank you all for very much for your patience. Quick update from Chris: we received the first watch case sample last week and the second sample (with the requested special enhanced-scratch-resistance lens) should be delivered to us by Friday. We've had two case design sync-up sessions with House of Horology this last week and Lawrence is finalizing their list of any issues that need to be addressed with the fit-validation cases prior to mold production. We expect to have that list and a schedule update in the next one to two days, and will be posting Update #21 once we have that information. [If Lawrence or his team requires a few extra days to complete their analysis and report, I will post update #21 by this weekend showing the watch cases and will then follow-up with the analysis results. We have a few photos to share and don't want to keep backers hanging.] P.S. For the engineers in the audience who would like to understand more about hardness, absolute hardness, Mohs vs HV, scratch resistance, and more: <url>"crystals") that are more scratch-resistant than traditional watch glass. We are similarly testing harder crystals for the watch's case back. There are several types of "scratch resistance" when it comes to lenses. Materials like Gorilla Glass go through chemical treatments which make scratches smaller and less apparent. Materials like ruby are simply so hard that most materials cannot scratch them easily. Put simply, only harder materials can scratch less-hard materials (with the caveat that adding pressure can increase abrasion). There is a popular hardness scale called the Mohs scale which is used by mineralogists to test the hardness of materials. This same scale is often used by watch makers to determine the scratch-resistance of watch lenses. The Mohs scale is neither linear nor logarithmic however so two Mohs numbers cannot be compared easily for purposes of absolute hardness. The watch design team has quoted the scratch-resistance of the candidate materials in HV (Vickers Hardness) which is an easier scale for direct comparison of scratch-resistance. Based on the quoted HV numbers, the main lens candidate we are testing is about 2x the hardness of mineral crystal (and more costly). This harder lens material can still be shaped, anti-glare coated, printed, engraved, etc.--all of which make it a great premium candidate lens for our smartwatch. The first fit-validation watch case sample shipped from China on Friday. The manufacturer had not completed the anti-glare lens sample yet, so we asked them to ship the sample with a lens made of a different material (which does not include the anti-glare coating) in the meantime so we could begin our testing and the watch design team could proceed with their work. We will photograph the initial samples and include them in Kickstarter Update #21 later this week; we are going to push back the regular update a few days to make sure we can include these important details for backers in the update. We may have some other quick snapshots or updates for backers in the next few days as well; I'll post those here in the Comments section to keep you up to date. -- Chris From Chris -- Lawrence Leyderman from House of Horology is in China this week and had a chance to check out one of the AGENT Smartwatch's fit-validation watch cases. Here's a quick photo of Lawrence trying on one of the fit-validation samples (with transparent test bezel), accessorized with a custom watchstrap. <url>#21. The samples probably won't make it here in time to take photos for an update before Monday--but I'll share some quick details here once they arrive. And then post photos and more details with Update #21 (which we'll hold a few days if necessary...if that means we can get some great case photos in there). I will try to catch up on the latest comments next week as well. Thank you to everyone who has written in and posted. I share your excitement (and your frustration) and am really looking forward to getting the watch cases into molding...so we can wrap up the remainder of this Kickstarter project and get watch rewards onto backers' wrists. P.S. we made the case backs for the fit-validation samples out of special chemically-strengthened, edge-to-edge watch glass. The design team is pretty excited about the design. They're awful expensive, but we are going for premium here: if the special glass backs meet all of our quality, pressure and beauty requirements then we plan on using them for production as well. From Chris -- a few quick updates... On watch case samples: we just received an e-mail from the watch case manufacturer; it sounds like the steel portion of the watch case samples is ready today. Woot! :) They indicated that the pressure gasket samples need an additional 10-13 days though (i.e. ready for shipment by the end of next week) but did not provide a reason. We have asked the watch gurus at House of Horology to find out why the gaskets need extra time, and we will be using that information to better manage supply for production (since a single missing part would mean that we couldn't completely assembly a watch). In the interim, the watch case manufacturer is PVD coating the pushers and may have time to PVD coat the fit-validation cases as well. On technology: this week we are seeing just how low we can push the "off" power consumption of AGENT. We architected its electrical design for really deep sleep (potentially less than one microamp of power). By nature, all battery-powered electronics with a software-based "on button" consume at least a little bit of battery power to sense button presses. But in our case we may be able to get the "off" current down so low that our consumption is below the battery's natural self-depletion rate (i.e. how much energy it would lose sitting on a shelf). Whether it's powered off while boxed up as a present or powered off because it's in your rotation of fashion wear, being able to wake it back up quickly with plenty of battery juice remaining is a good feeling. We're trying to polish as many details like this as we can. I will catch up on comments a bit later alongside Update #21 -- but in the interim I wanted to make sure we shared a quick update. We will be taking photos of the watch case samples as soon as they are in-house. From Chris -- a quick note on some of the fun stuff that's going on this week... Now that the watch case design is signed off on and the case manufacturer is making fit-validation samples, we're working through pressure testing procedures for the production line. Some manufacturers specify water resistance based on design specs rather than testing each unit, but we're building a premium device here and we're rather picky about quality. So we plan to hand test every AGENT Smartwatch for water resistance. There's a ton that goes into this aspect of production (including training, recordkeeping, re-testing after warranty repairs and more), but first we need to decide whether we are doing wet testing or dry testing on the watches. We also need to determine how many levels of pressure we will be testing (and if we will be doing negative vacuum pressure testing as well). Here's a glimpse at what wet pressure testers look like. With these, the quality assurance worker hand-pressurizes the water by pumping the machine's lever and then lowers the watch (already inside the pressurized chamber) into the water and looks for escaping air bubbles. These machines are used in many higher-quality watch repair shops and they provide a level of comfort that a watch conforms to the pressure-/water-resistance spec. <url>"was we use to clear the boards" should be: "way we use to clean the boards" @Shawn McIntyre -- [custom plastics in the case of my previous post was referring to charger plastics and backlight plastics.] @Shawn McIntyre -- great questions. Secret Labs is an electronics company that builds a lot of products (both SKU- and quantity-wise). We are an industry-leading ODM for IoT products which we can manufacture ourselves (at USA-based assembly houses) or work with clients to build at their preferred overseas assembly house. What we don't do is build custom plastics (although we're getting into that now with AGENT). Yes, we factor in panelization (which is a pretty basic part of making PCBs). These circuit boards are thin and small so our panels are pretty small (and we need to put the fiducials on the panels, rather than on the smart movements). For those who don't know what a fiducial is...it's a marker etched into circuit boards so that the robots which attach all the electronics chips have some way to align the board and make sure things fit properly; just like with GPS, you need several markers to orient things properly. We do have a costed BOM on the spin 1 circuit boards we built last year, although that is subject to change a little bit. The biggest BOM cost we don't know on the PCBs is the assembly cost. It's based on the # of parts placed on the board--but also involves things like the was we use to clear the boards and the amount of sanding required to create clean edges on the PCBs. We're not a multi-billion-dollar company, so we don't have a supply chain management department. But we do work with multi-billion-dollar distributors (we're a key NYC account for several huge software and microcontroller and distribution companies) and we do work directly with key suppliers and we do have four years of experience with supply chain logistics for electronics. Again...we're still learning the ropes with supply chain management on the watch case components side, but that shouldn't be too dissimilar by default. On single sourcing: for resistors, capacitors, etc. we have multiple sources. For microcontrollers we're using Atmel. For watch case components, coils and backlights we are single-source. The latter isn't something I would have done in my last gig as an executive at a billion-dollar manufacturing company, but it's what one has to do on a small project with a limited budget. Single-source does incur more risk, but it is also affordable and manageable for smaller projects. I look forward to the day where we have the volume and resources to dual-source all of our custom parts. @Adam Dzak and @Roma -- you have PM :) We can't appoint you as official reps or give you awesome dapper hats or anything...but I respect and appreciate your offer to help get more info out there (including the 99% of the meticulous boring engineering work that goes into a project like this) and we'll figure out a way to share more of it with you--which you can freely share with anyone else. @Kingwild -- thank you for your support. Our project is creating a premium timepiece that's very expensive parts-wise, offered as a reward to backers at far below selling price. It is not a typical smartwatch with huge profit margins. On your other questions: - You raised over a million dollars to do this project and you choose to part time it for about 10 hours a week? What were you thinking when you lured all backers in to this project with an estimated delivery of december 2013? Most respectfully, that is absolutely not true. We have spent thousands of hours on AGENT (I think I'm up to 2000+ myself alone by now) and I continue to spend 40+ hours a week on AGENT working with our team (including our extended team) to get it ready for your wrist. We had a plan which was aggressive timewise but we did anticipate delivering the first rewards in December 2013; unfortunately we ran into some supply delays on the custom parts that have pushed back those timelines. We're frustrated too and we're pushing to get into production as soon as we can. - You probably knew right from the start to you were never going to make the deadline. And you still choose to work with part time engineers. WHY?? Most respectfully again, we did not raise funds to hire a huge team of full-time engineers. We raised funds to build a premium product and our engineering staff is working as many hours as it takes to get that product done (full time or more some weeks, less when there's nothing required for them to do). And again, most respectfully, we did believe that we would be able to ship the first rewards in December. - One of the backers asked what would have happened if you only raised the initial goal of $100.000. Then you still had to meet your initial offer. I'd like an answer for this too. See the note above. There are things we're able to do with additional funding, but we completed most of the engineering work required for the baseline AGENT Smartwatch before we asked for funding through Kickstarter. With the huge investment we put into AGENT before Kickstarter (pretty much everything we could afford to invest into it--almost to the breaking point), and with the custom parts we originally planned to use, and with a more limited core featureset than we have been able to provide courtesy of extra time and extra funding...we expected to delivered about 550+ really nice rewards to our 550+ generous backers last December. I can sense your frustration, and I share it. Supply delays (which lead to production delays--even on estimated schedules) are no fun. I too yearn for an AGENT Smartwatch on my wrist. I offer you my sympathy and will continue leading our team to deliver what I believe will be something you'll love for your wrist. Thank you for backing our project and joining us as we make this timepiece a reality. @Roma -- the backlights aren't off-the-shelf units customized for the watch. They're high-efficiency (higher brightness per milliamp) units built from the ground up with our specified LEDs, optics-designed guide patterns, etc. @Joshua -- I just like Minnesota generally. Is that cool? Most folks that I've met in Minnesota and Wisconsin have been pretty swell people in my experience. I just hope that Minnesota is remembered more for the people and excellent food than for that TV series :) @Andrew Owendoff, @Christopher Burnett -- unfortunately (fortunately?) the majority of the cool physical things to photograph for our campaign were already completed before we started fundraising. Plus the circuit board internals (all of which were finished last year). It's unfortunate that the custom parts have been delayed and it does create a long hiatus here where we're waiting on the next "cool physical thing to photograph", so we're looking forward to getting those so we can start sharing more photos again. The vast majority of work for this project is in engineering (mechanical, electrical and software). The AGENT Smartwatch is an incredibly sophisticated, custom and premium piece of wristwear. Some of backers are super-technical so they enjoy the technical updates--but we do know that a lot of our backers are fashionistas and technical-but-not-engineer smartwatch fans who mostly just want to get their smartwatch reward on the wrist to enjoy. We'll continue sharing technical updates--and as we receive some of the new physical things to photograph we're ready and excited to share those too. @Backers -- thank you for all the questions. @Roma -- I'm happy to answer questions, didn't need 87 backers to ask the same ones--although it is great to get a feel for the most frequently-asked questions so we can get backers the insights they want most. Thanks for all your help. :) @Kueh -- as mentioned in update #20, the fit validation samples will largely use parts made from production or near-production materials, but the outer watch case piece will be made from fit-validation steel. Once we validate the shape and size and lens/case back pressure seals we can order molds--and then we will make production watch case samples using real candidate watch case materials. [Some of those will require materials imported from Switzerland that have 30+ day lead times...we're already addressing that.] @Shawn McIntyre -- updated schedule estimates are posted a bit farther down in the comments and also alongside update #20. We can take photos of the screen showing the CAD files which are being used to CNC mill watch cases this week if you'd like, but I think what you're looking for is a photo of the result of the work the watch case team has been doing the last two months. We should have those samples in about three weeks--and we'll be happy to take photos for you. We have also taken photos of the core watch circuitry (as seen on the main Kickstarter page and in the previous updates), provided screenshots of the SDK, etc. Most of the exciting things for photos will be actual watches--and we'll be close to that soon once the watch case samples (fit-validation and actual samples) arrive. I'm looking forward to being able to take photos to share, even if it's with a cameraphone. [And when we get close to shipping with final products, we'll try to take some professional photos so you can get a better hands-on feel for materials.] @Karsten Topp -- to help clear up the misconceptions that came through in your posts: we purchased a huge number of components (including really expensive ones) last year, getting ready to go into production with AGENT. We're working with watch case manufacturers and backlight design teams who make premium products that are not cheap. We continue to work full-time for our backers to get the AGENT Smartwatch ready for production. We are building something awesome together. Thank you for your support as we get AGENT ready for production (including the CNC watch case fit-validation samples we just ordered). @Joshua page -- thank you very much for your post and for your continued support. @Roma -- considering that I'm still up at 9:00am in New York (writing updates and responding to backer posts for the last 13 hours minus a quick sandwich break), being +14 hours from NY is no big deal. ;) Are you and Adam our official unofficial AGENT BIG team? [And is that a corny acronym?] @spaztastic -- most of the assembly will be done in the USA. A few of the watch case procedures require expertise and watchmaking equipment which exists in Asia and Europe. The circuit boards, assembly and testing of the final products, etc. will all be done here in the USA. As you mentioned, Foxconn is an ODM as well. They can help design products--or they can largely act as a manufacturing arm. In our case we are working with an ODM that designs and manufactures watches for a living--and we are using their expertise to make just the watch case components (and seal together the few parts that need to be assembled with their equipment). Some of those parts are made in Asia, and some of them may need to come from Switzerland. We're working out those details. @HUANG CHENGHUAN -- current estimated schedule puts start of reward fulfillment in October/November. We've included a more detailed timeline alongside update #20 (and below in the comments), and will continue updating the schedule as we cross each of the final milestones. @Richard, @Brent Roberts -- answers to Roma's questions are over here, posted in addition to Update #20 tonight: <url>"Gorilla Glass" (although many of them seem to be using the much older variety instead of what we've become accustomed to in modern smartphones--but the name is still cool) -- but those wearables were presumably designed to work around any limitations in the glass cutting. Gorilla Glass is pretty cool, but not an option for our smartwatch. We are testing some chemically-hardened lenses that provide scratch resistance while still being awesome glass for a smartwatch. We're pushing boundaries here, and look forward to seeing how far we can take the art of watch lenses for the smartwatch rewards. @Matthew Searle -- Kickstarter's Facebook link goes to individual profiles, not to product or company pages unfortunately. We looked into setting up the link early on. @Roma -- we do log into Kickstarter to catch up on PMs, etc. We get a pretty high volume of messages (which we appreciate--thank you to all the backers who have taken the time to write us) and it takes a while them all responded to with the attention they deserve. We try to catch up on the Comments every time we post an Update on the Kickstarter page--and sometimes more frequently--but we didn't see your post on the Comments page when we logged in a few days ago. Did we get all of your questions answered (on your post over on the forums--and copied here in the Comments)? @HECTOR -- thank you for your post. We're still here, working on an awesome smartwatch with and for our backers. Thank you for believing in us and our project and for all of your support! @Martin Berke -- we'll send you an official Kickstarter survey asking for your shipping address, but if you want to PM us your new address in the meantime we'll be happy to note it on your account as well. I know you were jesting; I just wanted to make sure we shared with your humor. BTW, SpaceX has a good chance of taking you to your new home; I'd love to hitch a ride if it was just for the weekend -- Chris @kcjnz -- let us know if you need any help putting together watch apps or watch faces. And please share them on the forums if you can; we're glad to celebrate your projects. Hey Team, We posted more details in update #20, but I just wanted to make sure that I posted here too for those that follow comments... The watch case team just signed off on the watch case (including modifications for tolerances and mating with the new backlight), we sent money to the watch case manufacturer for fit-validation samples, and they should be CNC'ing them for us over the next two weeks. When the samples arrive, we'll take some photos, start pressure tests, etc. Chris @Christopher Meier -- we just posted update #20 for you. @voiceofid -- to clear up confusion there: we ordered and received a huge volume of parts last year. We've run into some delays which are frustrating to both us and backers, and we're working through those. Most notably we're working with suppliers to get the final custom parts. Thanks for your patience as we complete this project together and get an awesome new cutting-edge smartwatch into production. @IOso -- we have posted some "behind the scenes" on the process to get custom parts made in Update #20 (in this case...watch cases). We'd like to provide more insights into the processes we're going through to get AGENT ready for production; please let us know what else you'd like to see. @Matt Mayatt, Michael -- quick update in response to your question: we posted an update on the estimated schedule below and also alongside Update #20. @SvS -- we tried mini-updates on the forums and offered to post them as comments, but got some pretty severe objections from backers. We may post some additional tidbits there (probably copied here in comments as well), but we'll focus most of the updates on the Updates page (which seems to be the most popular among backers). @Mohamedcheikhali, @Karsten Topp -- quick update in response to your question: we posted an update on the estimated schedule below and also alongside Update #20. @John -- response to your cross-posted question was posted in a response to your comment on update #19 (and the answer is in update #20). Please PM me if you have any other questions on the watch case review. @Karsten Topp -- you posted about watch case materials and antenna testing. We do know a lot about what doesn't work--and we know a lot about what does work. We've used that knowledge to pick some candidate watch case materials and we will base our final selection off of real engineering tests (with a spectrum analyzer) once we have assembled samples--along with final costs and risk assessments related to the materials. We're making a really nice product here--and we don't want to close any doors prematurely by picking a final watch case material without all the numbers. @Michael -- the leather straps are the same premium straps currently shipping on House of Horology's $600 Bedlam watches. We will have an extra-short and extra-long version as well. @Rick Wicker -- thank you for your post. As you noted, "holding pattern" is pretty much as-described. We can spend our extra hours working on new features for AGENT or tinkering and making small improvements, but the main gating items are the custom parts. [And thank you for taking the time to read updates and dig into where we're at...much appreciated.] @Adam Dzak -- no need to sign an NDA. We'd be happy to form a small committee to get more cool info out to backers, and none of that would be covered under NDA. [Also...we couldn't share most of the NDA stuff we work on anyway, as our NDAs wouldn't extend to non-staff-members and many of them are "need to know" only.] What's the best way to engage there? Please PM me. Also--thank you for tinkering with the SDK. More SDK updates to come :) @Brent Roberts -- Roma is an enthusiast and backer like many other backers. He's helped out a lot here by answering questions for other backers and helping correct misinformation which we appreciate. He's not being compensated by us in any way for that. He's just a cool guy. [although perhaps "just" is the wrong word] @Eric Gardocki -- I can vouch that Eric is definitely not getting any of the type of favor he referred to. At least not from @Creator :) @Brent Roberts -- you posted: "I think having a watch case is pretty important and something that, oh I don't know, would have already been taken into consideration and been manufactured." The watch cases were modified to mate with the new backlights--and then tweaked to meet water resistance requirements by the watch case experts. There's more information provided in the last few updates if you'd like to understand more about how the watch case was put together. As much as I'd like to build the computer before creating the transistor (or have scrambled eggs before chickens lay them?), one has to come before the other. Chris @Brent Roberts -- in response to your question about the watch case materials, here's a quick answer for you: <url>"This is a popular question, and I am happy to answer it again. We have designed the watch case with sufficient internal wall thickness that we can use any of several premium watch case materials. We will not know which material we are using until we have done RF and pressure tests and approve the final cost of the materials. We are not building a $3 watch case here; we are building a watch case which would retail for $100-$200 all by itself. Once we know what materials we are using for sure, we can write an update and celebrate the final selection together. The watch case team has designed a watch case compatible with several polymers, ceramics and composites. It won't be made of wood, although perhaps we should consider that for a special edition in the future. Wood is pretty cool." @Brent Roberts -- in your post you said "all if what I have just written is fact not fiction." That may have been specifically written to refer to a single sentence in your post. I respectfully and factually disagree with the accusations and statement, and most respectfully remind you that willingly posting misinformation is a violation of Kickstarter rules. I don't know how to say that more politely or without coming across as angry at you in some way. We want you to be involved; it's just not helpful to back a project and then tear it down and purposefully misinterpret and rephrase posts in an effort to rile people up. We are grateful that you have backed our project and look forward to continuing to move this product towards production with you. Please help us out by helping us provide the latest information to backers who ask questions here on the comments page, and we will do our part by delivering you a great smartwatch reward (or helping sell your reward once it comes off the production line). Thank you very much for your support. That may come across as trite, but we are grateful and we're excited to complete what we started together. @Roma -- we don't have final answers to all the specifics regarding integration with iPhone 5 yet, but we can answer those questions a little closer to shipping the iPhone client. @Brent Roberts -- we say "estimate" because that is the accurate term. This is a Kickstarter project, not a commercial product launch, and there are potential bumps in the road. We can estimate how long things will take and even work full time to move through every milestone--but I cannot make you promises based on the future. We provided an updated schedule estimate in Update #20 for you; we want to keep you up to date and we'll try to include schedule updates as we cross each milestone on the way to the finish line. @Karsten Topp -- to be clear, my point was that our prototypes were built using parts that Secret Labs designed, engineered and manufactured. It's pretty easy to pick up an Arduino and make a "smartwatch" prototype. That's a very very different scenario than our prototypes :) From Chris -- 7am, catching up on a few of the comments... There are too many comments to respond to them all, but I want to get as many as I can before heading to bed. @Ken Rogers -- thanks for your post. Based on your request (combined with requests from other backers), we included a "behind the scenes" section in Update #20 to show more of the daily goings-on that happens getting things ready for production. Most of what we do is engineering work, but working with suppliers sometimes ends up being a lot more involved and time-consuming than originally anticipated. BTW, I don't know if I gave enough kudos to the backlight engineers in my last updates. They have really gone above and beyond the call of duty--even helping coordinate with the watch case manufacturer, helping them understand some of the requirements for exchanging CAD files, making sure that mechanical tolerances were correct, etc. @Ben Baskaran -- how about a third option: a little money and a really nice smartwatch reward? We're pretty confident this is going to be a nice product, and we're grateful to be building it with your support. [continued from last post] Communication We love our backers. We really, really appreciate all of you supporting our project, and we are honored to be working with you. I personally look forward to getting to the finish line together and getting rewards onto your wrists. In the meantime, we are spending thousands of hours on the AGENT Kickstarter project plus up to about 40 hours per month engaging with backers. Unfortunately we are a small Kickstarter project without a budget for a PR person--or else we'd hire or dedicate people to engage even more with backers. Until we start shipping watches to retail customers, we won't have the kinds of profit necessary to staff up--but in the meantime we will try to get back to as many e-mails and PMs as we can--with the goal of engaging with every backer who wants deeper engagement. To be clear--we were able to keep up with responses on the Comments page but the volume of comments has increased so dramatically that we can no longer keep up with the Comments page (and also focus on getting these watches to the finish line). We will try to browse the Comments page to understand the kinds of project insights backers would like us to include in updates, and we will try to respond to some of the comments every once in a while. The sheer volume of posts is too large to keep up with and respond to each post, and there is no organization method there to efficiently deliver answer to backers, so we have also set up the forums as an additional tool to help organize frequently-asked questions. For those backers who have been following the project and can quote old posts in full to help answer other backers' questions, thank you. You're really helping us out, and we appreciate it. Together we can make sure all backers get the answers they're looking for and the individual attention they deserve. We really love all of our backers. We're not perfect, and we don't have either time or budget to respond to comments full-time, but we're trying our best to get this project to production (while setting aside up to ten hours a week to hang out with you, respond to inquiries, etc.). I know I say it a lot but...thank you so much for your support. Backers and bloggers If Adam or any of our backers would like to help out with communication, we'd be thrilled to coordinate with a few of you every week to help answer the most recent questions, get out some cool intra-update tidbits, etc. If a few backers are interested in doing so, please PM me and we can absolutely get that started. We don't have any official sort of volunteer spokesperson program, but we'd love to work with a few community representatives to help take care of our awesome backers' needs. Roma--did you also just volunteer for the AGENT backer intelligence group (BIG)? Thanks! Chris Hey team--I've been in some pretty intensive sessions with engineering and the watch case team the last few days, and didn't see the question list from the last week. Thanks Roma for pulling those together--and for everyone for their inquiries. As Alibek noted, here are some detailed answers to the questions most asked by backers this last week: <url>"metal façade" on the outside of the case with breaks in it as you mentioned--but I'm not sure how nice that would look or how it would affect the pushers, case strength, etc. The other concern would be finding a watch case manufacturer who had the appropriate tooling for such a design. And from a product perspective, the overall case design and component selection are mostly locked down at this point. @Maxim Enbaev -- the watch case design we are currently working with (from update #19) has the same outer shape and dimensions as the earlier prototype cases. There's no way to post images in-line with comments, but there's a quick estimated dimension chart on the main project page. @Ken Rogers -- thank you for your comment. What question can we help address for you? @Karsten Topp, @Michael, @Jussi Myllyluoma -- thank you for asking about materials. Some notes on that are below (in response to Roma, but I wanted to say thank you to all of you as well). @Karsten Topp -- while we think Arduinos are cool, we have never created any mockups with Arduino mainboards in the back. We did use one of the system-on-chip modules we created at Secret Labs (a Netduino Mini) in our early watch prototypes, as featured in photos on the main product page. Those ran apps in an earlier custom version of the runtime we are now using for the AGENT Smartwatch. The black devboards featured on our main Kickstarter page also ran an earlier version of the custom runtime we're using for the watch. There are some photos and videos of both from last spring on our Facebook page, running code including some code created by and generously shared by backers. On regulatory testing...as you mentioned, regulatory certifications can only be done on completed products. We have been using FCC pre-certified radio modules since the first devboards (as seen in the photos on the main page) to reduce risk in regards to regulatory compliance. @Roma -- in response to your question about watch case materials, I also added a quick P.S. for you related to update #19: "P.S. as mentioned in update #19, the watch case team added a little bit of thickness to the inner walls of the watch case. This helps maximize our options regarding watch case materials." @Roma -- thank you for asking about watch case materials. While we won't be able to make a final determination on materials for all components until we conduct tests on production case samples, we have learned a few things through our tests so far. You asked the question over on the forums (which is awesome, because now it will be easy for people to search for and find answers if they're curious); I posted some of our notes for you in response. Here's the link to Roma's question: <url>"Hi Roma, Thank you, and great question! On materials... For the rear watch caseback: as discussed over on Kickstarter a while ago, metal probably won't work since metal blocks/absorbs wireless energy. For the main portion of the watch case: the outer ring of the watch case is not in the center of the energy transfer field. We have tested materials from the four main categories of materials (metals, ceramics, polymers and composites), the one particularly-problematic material from our tests so far has been stainless steel. Because we're using the Qi wireless charging standard, and since we want the watch to be able to charge on any Qi charger, we've been testing with multiple chargers. In preliminary tests with our custom charger, we had some parasitic losses with our early CNC-milled stainless steel samples but were still able to get some energy from the charger to the power receiver coil in the watch. With other Qi chargers, we experienced intermittent charger failures which resulted in the chargers refusing to transmit energy; basically the chargers are detecting high losses and go into a standby mode. We discussed our observations with one of the engineers who works on the Qi transmitter chips, and he mentioned that the circular nature of watch cases might act as a sort of loop which creates an increased amount of intermittent parasitic draw. We need to conduct full tests on sample watch cases using new watch design before we know what materials will/will not work for sure, and then we can officially rule out specific materials. In the meantime--for the outer ring of the watch case--of the four categories of materials (metals, ceramics, polymers and composites) our focus is on the last three categories. As described in our Kickstarter fundraising campaign, we will be selecting the final material based on beauty and wireless performance. Once we have good data with production samples we can write up some of the results in one of the Kickstarter Updates. We are still too early to make a final call and unfortunately we just had to change the watch case to accommodate the replacement backlight--so it will be a little while before we know for sure." Chris @Minning Xiang -- from Chris -- are you SupperDog on the forums? We are more than happy to take questions on the forums and dive deeper into some of the work we're doing to get AGENT ready for production. We just ask that questions are asked in the body of posts and that posts use a polite tone, as we want all posters to feel safe and welcome. I believe you are referring to your post which asked the question: "I cannot remember how many times I have asked this question." It was the same topic as your previous thread, so I asked if you wouldn't mind re-posting the thread with the question in the body of the topic. You reposted the same post again exactly as before--so we went ahead and combined your post with your existing thread. The body of your message doesn't make a lot of sense without a question in it, but we did not delete it and we kept it for you. <url>#16: <url>#19, and monitor comments to gauge the reaction from non-technical backers. We love sharing this stuff; we just don't want to make non-technical backers feel like they have to be technically-oriented to use their designer watch reward. Thank you for your posts; please keep the feedback coming. @Brent Roberts -- The frontlight manufacturer was highly recommended by several people in our Fortune 500 supply chain. They provided the recommendation based on our requirements and because they believed it was a lower-risk path than creating a custom backlight. I am not going to throw people under the bus; we followed the recommendations. They only provided the best insights they could. Of course we spent money (on prototypes, paying for engineering expenses, lots of shipping, in-person meetings, etc.) on the previous backlights. The company who created our custom backlight was not an available option last year. And even if they were, industry display experts recommended the frontlight option as the lower-risk solution which also happened to be closest to our thickness specs. We try very hard to engage with and show love to our backers. We respond to a lot of PMs. If you have not felt loved, please let us know how we can make you feel more loved. The main Kickstarter page (<url>"really cool functioning prototype" to "ship-ready product". On your last question: I know it sounds trite, but Kickstarter is not a store. We come here and we pool our resources together to make creative projects possible. As a thank you, backers are given the choice to select a reward related to the project. Huge amounts of money are then spent on electrical engineering, software engineering, molds, certifications, trips to meet with suppliers, etc. The budget is set up front, and huge volumes of components were ordered up front. We do understand that life circumstances change and that some backers may decide they no longer want the optional reward they selected. If that's the case for you, once your reward comes off the production line we'll do what we can to help you sell that reward. If Kickstarter were a store and we were making a profit on the watches, it would be a much different story. We're here, participating in the creation of a really cool creative project together. The result of that journey will be what we believe is a really nice watch. We are grateful that you chose to come along on that journey. Chris @Brent Roberts -- there are no advertisements on the forums. There is no upsell. There is no hit counting. There is no registration required to view the interim updates or search through questions people have asked. It is another web page, another resource which provides additional updates which got lost otherwise. The latest Kickstarter Update is here, posted yesterday: <url>#19 on the Kickstarter Updates page--where it will be auto-emailed to backers. We will continue posting there about once a month. @Brent Roberts -- we are here, and we are listening. There's little that we can do to respond to negative comments other than post more updates and continue moving AGENT towards the production line. For any polite questions about the project, the product we're building together or what it takes to get something like this to production, we are more than happy to help answer your questions or provide more insights. @Roma, @Jussi Myllyluoma -- thank you very much for your posts. To be clear, the new "News and Announcements" section and "Kickstarter Project" forum is a supplement to Kickstarter updates and engagement, not a replacement. While Kickstarter has a Q&A section for projects during the fundraising period, there is no organized Q&A capability for use afterwards. And while Kickstarter has a mechanism for large updates that are auto-emailed out to all backers, there's not a good way to post smaller more regular updates for backers that want more more insights into the process. So we've created these new tools as supplements. Backers can continue posting polite questions about the project here as part of the community, and we and other backers will try to answer those questions or point them to existing answers. And for backers looking for a answer to a question, the forums also provide a quick and easy way for them to get answers to questions that have already been asked. I do hope that Kickstarter adds similar functionality to the core Kickstarter platform in the future; we would gladly use those additional features. In the meantime, we are striving to find better ways to deliver information to backers while we wrap up this project. There may be no ideal methods--but we are trying to find more and better ways to engage. -- Chris @Paul Shabian -- did we get your PM answered alright? @Joe Kelly -- to be clear, the new backlight is a custom backlight. It was designed specifically for AGENT, and it is much thinner than other backlights for memory displays. For reference--neither we nor Sharp (the manufacturer of the display) could locate a vendor offering off-the-shelf backlights for our memory display. @Robert Finnigan -- we will send you a survey closer to production, asking for your shipping address. If you'd like us to note your account with your new address just in case, please send us a PM and we can do that too. @Tim, @Adam Dzak, @Michael W, @IOso, @Rick Wicker, @Roma, @Jussi Myllyluoma, @Peter Kavanagh, @Ryan Sweet -- thank you very much for the kind words and for your support. @Robert Holbert -- thank you for your feedback on which kinds of third-party apps you'd like us to create. Items like Twitter and Facebook integration are on our shortlist, and we've been testing live tweets to watches in the lab. @Nicolai Kragh-Hansen -- Phillips Hue support would be cool. Today the Hue uses Zigbee through an IP gateway rather than Bluetooth. But a lot of similar devices are now coming to market with Bluetooth Low Energy support instead...making direct integration and intelligent a real possibility. @Karsten Topp -- Our Kickstarter project has both fashion-loving backers and developer backers (plus fashion-loving developers). The "Kickstarter Updates" page auto-emails all subscribed backers with every update: so we tend to do large roll-up updates there (with less focus on the technical details that are confusing to non-technical backers) to avoid overwhelming backers. We have posted smaller updates on the "Comments" page in the past, but Updates-via-Comments tend to get lost several pages down fairly quickly. So we have created an easy way for interested backers to get the latest interim updates--including details on some of the intense technical work we're doing on the project. If you would like all the latest updates: click on this link, sign in, and click the "follow this forum" button. Updates will be e-mailed to you automatically. <url>"The present and future of the .NET runtime for AGENT" <url>"News and Announcements" section we have created on the AGENT forums, where we will be posting more frequent updates to engage more closely with backers. Some of these updates will be "rolled up" into the official "Kickstarter Updates" which get auto-emailed to backers, and some of them will be additional information available to backers who want to be more deeply engaged with the project. So if you would like to stay on top of ALL of the latest-and-greatest with AGENT, simply go here, sign in and click on "follow this forum": <url>"Kickstarter Project" forum, where backers can ask questions about our Kickstarter project, while we work together getting AGENT ready for production: <url>"notification center" notification to a watch. AGENT is designed around a much more intelligent notification platform, but we know that some users really want that "firehose of notifications" (every e-mail and perhaps whatsapp messages)...thus the powertools. Our goal is to make notifications simple, powerful and context-aware. If there are specific notification scenarios you'd like to see supported, please let us know. If you're very engineering-minded and you know how those apps on your phone or your phone OS best forward those notifications to a Bluetooth device (MAP, SPP, GATT, BLE notifications, etc.) please share that too. Whether that can be supported in the core OS, in a first-party app or in a third-party app...we want to help provide you with the freedom to get the information you want at a glance. Chris @Frank Schmidberger -- we can't speak for 3rd-parties regarding what their apps will support, but if you're asking about features that integrate with smartphones...the announced feature set includes caller ID, lost phone alert, music control, notifications, etc. (as described on the main Kickstarter page and shown on the prototype watch in the video). All of those features will be supported on each of the three supported smartphone platforms (iPhone, Android and Windows Phone); some of those will be more flexible on smartphone platforms which have richer support for those scenarios. And many of those features will be supported on Windows 8.1 tablets as well. We are also looking at providing "power tools" for features which don't fit well with our user experience objectives--but which some of our backers have asked us to support. And we will be delivering additional features via in-field firmware updates and first-party watch apps. @Frank Schmidberger -- from Chris -- thin backlights such as the ones we've been working on (both the light-guide film plus the new <1mm backlight) take up to six months to design, refine, mold, sample, etc. We started searching for optical engineers and custom backlight manufacturers before the Kickstarter campaign launched--knowing that our size, efficiency, light quality and luminosity requirements were atypical. Yes, it has been a long and unfortunately bumpy backlight road--which has been frustrating. I am very glad that we will e clearing this milestone soon, with a custom-designed and surprisingly thin backlight that will serve our smartwatches very well. From Chris -- we were hoping to surprise you all with a cool upgrade to that light-guide film, one of a few unannounced upgrades, but unfortunately it was not meant to be. :( I am heartbroken that moving to another backlight adds another few months to the production timeline (since we need to make molds and test the new backlights). We are so excited about these fashionable watches and their cutting-edge technology and it crushes us that we all have to wait a few more months to get them onto our collective wrists. Some important clarity on the backlights: The new backlights are really well-engineered, thin and use premium components. They should provide a great viewing experience, consistent with our original vision. Yes, backlights do require more energy than light-guide film. Conversely, these backlights do not need to be turned on quite as frequently--since there is no contrast reduction (i.e. no film overlay). We will be making some tweaks to maximize battery runtime with the new backlights; we want to make sure you have a great battery experience. The road to production is taking longer than any of us would have liked, but we are building something great together. Made possible by your support. Thank you so much. Update #18 is live; so sorry that it took an extra day+ to complete and post. That said: there's so much that goes into the backlights, and we could only fit so much into a reasonably-short update. So we'll be monitoring comments on the update later today if you have any questions. Thank you all so much for your support. -- Chris @Paul Daly -- from Chris -- we're not exhibiting at BUILD this year. I'll miss you guys :( Too much to do, too little time. P.S. 3:52am, still taking photos for Update #18...thanks for your patience everyone; this is going to be a very late night. For those awesome backers who are watching for backlight news: we should complete testing of the production backlight samples in the next day, and we will be spending Sunday afternoon and evening writing Kickstarter Update #18 (all about backlights). The full update should be posted Sunday night--but it might be late night. Lots to cover. @Jussi Myllyluoma -- we're here. We're listening. We're testing backlights and working on software updates for AGENT. Kickstarter Update #18 (about backlights) is coming this weekend. @Laur Lõhmus -- too early to tell what new value the pre-announced Android SDKs will provide for wearables. We know that Android continues to be far too energy-hungry for use in wearables like AGENT (as also evidenced by Samsung's switch from Android to Tizen), but it would be cool to enable wearables integration features on Android phones. Quick update: our supplier emailed us tracking info for our production-sample backlights. FedEx should deliver them to us shortly and we should complete validation tests by this weekend. Update #18 will focus on backlights, will be posted by this weekend, and will include photos and details from this week's production-sample backlight tests. If the backlights do not pass our validation tests, we will walk backers through our contingency plans in a backer-only update. Once the samples are tested, we will also be able to calculate and share updated estimates for our production schedule. This is going to be a busy week :) Thank you all for your feedback and support. - Chris Richard -- to be clear, the estimated 60 day timeline to start-of-production begins once backlight production-samples are in hand and meet specifications. It's the backlight production-samples that we've been waiting on. We should be receiving samples this week and should have test results by the end of the week (for Update #18). From Update #16: "Once the backlights are in hand and meet specification, it takes an estimated 30 days to finalize the watch case and build samples—and then roughly 30 days for Qi and FCC/IC/CE certification. Once we have passed those tests, we can push the smartwatch into production." P.S. Your avatar is pretty nifty. What does it symbolize? @Roma -- from Chris -- I'm a big proponent of free speech. I'm not a big proponent of free speech which makes other backers unjustly feel unwelcome. In the end we just try to respect people and show backers the appreciation they deserve--and know that things will work themselves out. On backer updates--we spend dozens of hours every month engaging with and updating backers; for better or worse we have to divide that time out between writing updates on the Updates page (6-10 man hours per update), engaging with backers one-on-one via messaging (sometimes a few minutes, sometimes a few hours) and secondarily responding on the Comments page (several hours reading and replying this week). We try to strike a good balance between all these update methods, but by the nature of the beast we will never be able to meet all backers' desires for venue or style of updates. We will continue engaging with and informing backers at least once a month via the larger updates in the Updates section--and also via smaller notes and updates in between big Updates via e-mail, the Comments page, etc. @Roma -- P.S. We love you and want you to feel comfortable here too. :-) Thank you as always for your support. @Roma -- please, please, no taunting; we want all backers to feel safe and comfortable here. :) As far as being perfectionists...we do try to avoid that, since perfection is the enemy of getting products out the door. We sometimes do go a little overboard over-engineering the hardware and paying attention to details though, for better or worse. @Cesar Del Pino -- The energy usage of a product is a sum of all of its parts' power consumption...so we've been paying similar attention to every component. That said: backlights are right at the top of the power consumption chart. @Chris Jutting -- backlight contingency plans go into place if the main backlight supplier cannot deliver. We will have quite a bit of backlight detail in next week's Update #18. @Spencer Kaplan -- we'll be writing and posting Update #18 next week. Stay tuned, and thank you for your patience. @Rena B -- as @Roma mentioned, we will be asking for your shipping address via an official Kickstarter survey later this year. If you're concerned that you'll miss that survey, you can also just message us with your new address. No worries. @Dino -- creating rewards for our backers is our primary production focus right now. But since the reservation list for watch pre-orders is longer than the backer list (and growing), you'll see a lot of AGENT Smartwatches out there in time. @Paul Tsai -- crafting a backlight from scratch which requires a third of the energy of a traditional backlight, is ten times thinner, and is well-suited for a super-reflective display which blocks around 99% of a backlight's light...is an unusually-difficult process. There are several lighting experts working on it, and we are confident that we have a road to successful completion, but for better or worse these things sometimes take more time than estimated. @Roma -- we love our backers. No baseball bats, please. That's the old style of business in New York. Or was it New Jersey? I can't remember. I'm neither a fan of violence nor mobs. @John -- I often log in to respond to e-mails, etc. I'm on a lot of airplanes this month (an estimated 20,000 miles meeting up with suppliers, collaborators, preparing for production, etc.) so if you see us log on but we don't get a chance to see the comments--please don't feel unloved. We may just be trying to catch up on backer e-mails when we have a good Wi-Fi connection. @Jussi Myllyluoma -- from Chris -- we will continue updating backers at least once every month with an Update on the Kickstarter Updates page. I did set expectations that we would update backers twice a month, and for various reasons we have chosen to post a large update on the Updates page monthly instead of writing two much quicker updates. For bad expectations I set regarding updates...I sincerely apologize. This is my first Kickstarter campaign and--while that does not excuse such expectation-setting--we're still learning the ropes. We are spending dozens of hours every month engaging with backers, writing updates, etc. but in the end--for better or worse--our primary focus is on getting AGENT rewards onto our backers' wrists. Thank you for your patience, and for backing our project. We're super-glad that we're on this journey with our backers. @Jussi Myllyluoma, @Rick Wicker and @Dino -- based on your comments, you have some good insights into what it takes to give birth to more-sophisticated technology products. Thank you very much for sharing your insights. @Chris -- once the backlight samples are approved, we will post something celebrating that milestone. The "Comments" page isn't actually an update page or a Q&A page, but we know that a number of very eager backers are logging into it regularly so we will expedite posting of that news there. We will also include it in our regular Kickstarter Update. @Rick Wicker -- your comment cracked me up. I'm glad that Jurassic Park was not a Kickstarter campaign, as the reward deliveries might have had taken on a life of their own. [Also...I can't even imagine dealing with German customs, trying to ship a live dinosaur.] @Dino -- we would _love_ it if Kickstarter added a few tools to enable project creators and backers to engage even better. For instance, a "milestone" feature along an estimated timeline where project creators could check off items and provide notes on major milestones would be awesome. And a Q&A section would be great. @David Scheip -- backlight contingency plans go into place if the main backlight supplier cannot deliver. There are a lot of moving parts there, with screens that transmit less than 1% of light from backlights and a fairly intensive design processes--so it is not quite as simple as hiring a new supplier. We will keep backers updated in a way that reduces backlight schedule risk. Regarding prototypes... To confirm: no, the prototypes were definitely not good enough to sell. They were, as defined, prototypes. Kickstarter's rules do not let project creators show renderings of what the final product is anticipated to look like, in an effort to make sure that this is clear. So we made a prototype (milled out of aluminum and powder coated) which reasonably approximated the final product--knowing that the prototype wasn't nearly as nice as what we planned for the product enabled by our backers' generous funding--but hopeful that it would help convey our vision of an awesome timepiece that we could build together. Regarding custom parts--our suppliers all committed to deliver the custom parts in time for production. A few were a little late (like the coils) but came through pretty close to schedule. The backlight should have taken only 4-6 months to create and is, very unfortunately, delayed. We're working through that now, and look forward to getting production backlights into production watches as soon as we reasonably can. We really appreciate your support. @Nicolai Kragh-Hansen -- while waiting for the backlight production samples to arrive, most of our non-backlight work is focused around refinements for the version one firmware and work which we were planning on doing post-launch for the first new-feature release. A lot of that work is not terribly exciting, except to non-engineers. As an example, earlier this week we wrote new code which allows us to patch the ROM (non-updateable) firmware that sits inside the Bluetooth radios. The Bluetooth radios work great even without the patches. But Texas Instruments updates the ROM on their Bluetooth radios from time to time to provide a better experience or enable new Bluetooth features--and even though it's not possible to rewrite ROM ("read only memory") we wanted to be able to provide those features via in-field updates. And the Bluetooth radios have a feature which we can leverage to push those patches to RAM when the AGENT Smartwatch first boots (and anytime we do an in-field update). Now that we've successfully implemented the Bluetooth radio update code, we have timed the patch process at around five seconds. And we feel that that is an unreasonable amount of time to wait on a splash screen while a smartwatch "boots". So we are speed-optimizing the process and creating a mechanism whereby we can update the Bluetooth radio in the background as and after the watch boots. This will create a much nicer user experience. Next we will be working through the security requirements necessary to deliver the patches to the watches--and we will be looking at whether or not we want to enable the patches in our redundant bootloaders. We will be pulling out the Bluetooth packet sniffing analyzers and doing some performance testing and sanity checks. That is just one task on a list of hundreds of little things we are working on to differentiate AGENT from the commodity smartwatch market. We believe that paying attention to the details is what makes products great. And of course, even though we are "waiting for backlights," that's a bit of a misnomer. It still takes a lot of hours in the week to work with our backlight supplier, help sort out mold and production issues, create contingency plans in case the backlight requires slight modifications to another custom component, etc. The process should be worth it in the end though. @Adam -- the custom backlights from our main are designed to consume an estimated third of the power of a traditional backlight. The supplier came very highly recommended to us by experts who work with the memory displays we're using because of this (and because it can take 4-6 months to create a custom backlight from scratch for these highly-reflective displays). @ymilord -- once we have backlights, we can finalize watch case molds. We need production samples of both of those to build fully-assembled units. The big hold-up right now are the backlights. We have several staff members and external resources working on the issue. @Jussi Myllyluoma -- We were expecting backlights almost two weeks ago, and our supplier called to let us know they needed three more weeks to resolve sample production issues. So we are now expecting to receive backlight samples by the end of next week. We also have backlight contingency plans, in case our supplier can't deliver. @Rick Wicker -- yes, you're on the right track there. "Black glass" is a term for glass which has ink applied on the backside to block out most light. This is done on many nice laptops to hide light sensors while still letting enough light through to sense if the room is dark. In our case we're using a premium ambient light sensor which is 64 times more sensitive than the alternative traditional light sensor and so we can measure a full range of luminosity (brightness) even through a dark panel. We are concerned about glass as a bezel material for quality reasons (scratching, the screw designs, etc.) so we've built a plan around using either black glass or a dark translucent polymer. Ether one can be pretty. BTW, the bezel is the front area of the watch around the screen (under the watch lens) which mates to the outer case. The early prototypes used a single piece for a combined outer ring and bezel, but a single-piece design (although likely less expensive to manufacture) can negatively limit material selection flexibility--so we use a two-piece design for production. -- Chris @Richard Hustwit -- no worries. Delays frustrate us all. We understand. We sympathize. We are working to alleviate that frustration expeditiously, with a shiny new AGENT Smartwatch on your wrist. @Richard Hustwit -- from Chris -- as mentioned in Update 17, if the production samples do not meet our spec requirements, we have contingency plans in place. Simply put: if the production samples are no good then we will reject them. The backlight supplier will then try to fix the issue. And if necessary we will have another backlight manufacturer make a more traditional backlight, rather than the custom high-tech backlight our backlight supplier has been getting ready for our watch. We will not use backlights which do not meet the quality standards we have set for the watch...and we will use a high-quality "regular" backlight design if our supplier cannot get the custom high-tech backlight working soon. BTW, the backlight supplier is here in the USA, and they assemble their backlights here in the USA. We do have component suppliers all over the world (primarily in Asia, Europe and North America) but we have tried to work with domestic suppliers to reduce schedule risk where possible. We share your frustration that backlights which were promised for samples in October (for FCC testing) and in volume by December (for production) are not yet ready for production. We are working along several paths to avoid having to wait much longer. We want to get AGENT Smartwatch rewards onto your wrists as soon as possible. Thank you for your support, and your patience as we push through this backlight challenge. @Chris -- once we receive the production backlight samples, we will put them into testing immediately. We will share those results and the corresponding schedule update with you once the tests are completed. We will be sharing some deeper Bluetooth technical details in an upcoming update. On your question about the watch case components: the watch case is basically made up of four layers. From top to bottom: watch lens; bezel; main outer watch case; case back. We also have five pushers (watch buttons) and the metal bars which attach the watch strap to the main watch body. We plan to manufacture the bezel out of a dark translucent polymer or "black glass" (depending in part on which one mates best with the lens--we don't want the lens to scratch the bezel). The high-sensitivity ambient light sensor will be able to detect the ambient light level behind the black bezel--almost magically. Here are the photo URLs from Alex and Stéphane's sessions, one more time: <url>éphane Sibué's connected devices session at Microsoft Techdays 2014: pic.twitter.com/cZjUDP9OmI <url>éphane! @Jussi Myllyluoma -- the goal with posting smaller updates on Facebook is that we can do it without constant e-mails going out to backers. Most backers want occasional larger updates (once or twice a month) and some backers want more frequent smaller updates. So we're going to try to strike a balance, to help keep all backers in the loop with interesting and important data about the project and our progress. @Chris Jutting, @Stephen Ho -- pre-release operating systems from Apple, Microsoft and others typically come with NDA restrictions. So rumors are likely either made up and/or violations of NDAs. To that point--developers in those types of programs wouldn't be able to say anything; and developers who aren't in those types of programs wouldn't be able to say anything either. @Frank Schmidberger -- that is a very complex question worthy of several pages of charts and descriptions of how the developer tools work. For the purposes of keeping answers simple: AGENT is designed to offer best-in-class notification support. We'll support several notification types on each of the three platforms (including Caller ID, etc.). We're not going to turn on the "fire hose of notifications" where your wrist buzzes every few minutes...because that's not a great user experience...but we will enable third-party apps to do so. Our goal is to give you the freedom to choose how you use your watch and to get the most value out of your timepiece. We'll put together a more detailed list of the types of things that phone-based notifications enable before we ship, so that you can easily take advantage of these features when you receive your watch reward. @Chris Jutting -- the TDK module is a an embedded die version of TI's CC2541 chip. The CC2541 is the single-mode (low energy only) version of the CC2564 dual-mode (low energy + classic) chip we're using in AGENT. You want dual-mode; otherwise you won't get Caller ID and music control on all platforms. @Minning, @Roma -- no, the thanks belongs to you guys. We have so many awesome backers supporting AGENT, and those backers seem to be really generous, patient people. Yes, there's some occasional speculation that gets people riled up and sometimes (I will assume unintentionally or through misunderstanding) there's even misinformation put out there that discourages some of the backers. But by and large our backers mean well, are helping shape the wearables industry, and are going to be ambassadors of both technology and fashion with cool smartwatches strapped to their bodies :) @Lou Caputo -- I'm pretty confident that the AGENT Smartwatch will make it into your wrist rotation. Or become your main watch. It's great technology, a great watch and great looking. @Dino -- regarding developers... Millions of developers basically already know how to write apps for AGENT, since we've integrated a really compelling Microsoft-based runtime into our custom architecture. We are growing now into 10,000s of watch rewards + reservations. And we are delivering capabilities for app developers that lower-end watch platforms were never designed to handle. So we should see some really cool apps with some cool features. @Paul Tsai -- to be clear, we have already done preliminary Qi testing with candidate case materials and our spin 1 smartwatch PCBs. Based on those results, we're refining materials and testing some composite materials to select a case material that looks good and works well with both inductive charging and RF. But we can't make molds for the watch cases until we have final approval on and begin production of the backlight because our different backlight options connect differently and require slight modifications in the case design. That's why there is a dependency between watch case and backlight. So yes, to confirm...we've already started a lot of that testing, largely to help avoid schedule risk once the production backlights are ready. @John -- my sincere apologies if you had a comment disappear on Facebook. I wasn't actually aware that was possible. If it happened, it was a total accident trying to respond to your message or clicking a wrong link or who-knows-what. Please, by all means, re-post. Or shoot us an e-mail. We're here to engage. @Peter Kavanagh -- thank you for the comment. Having grown up in the relative countryside, that video made me smile. @All -- if I missed any comments, please PM me. I think I caught up on most of them, but I don't want any of you to feel unappreciated. I can't even begin to express how much your support of our project--and the product we're able to bring to your wrists and to the market--means to us. Thank you. -- Chris @Robert Holbert -- Regarding forum posts -- we're big believers in free speech. But we also believe in politeness and in moderation and in keeping things on topic in forums. We did have a forum member who posted a specific question to a specific individual (i.e. a private message) in a public forum (rather than using the private message feature). The title was in ALL CAPS and the post was about two words long. We left that post on the forums for a few days--just to make sure that it was publicly seen and that the author had the chance to express their thoughts--because we were trying to err on the side of free speech. After a few days we moved the post to the private message section and I wrote an individual reply to the author, to make sure their question was answered. I can't say if that's the best policy or not, but our goals with online forums are to create a community where people can express themselves without making others feel unwelcome (or violating any laws--which is another topic). We may also lock threads, sometimes temporarily, from time to time if emotions get high among authors of posts. And we'll give out warnings to users who continually need a little reminder to be polite. Those are pretty typical moderation items for online forums, and we do them because we want to make sure that everyone feels safe and has the freedom to express themselves (while remembering good manners). Regarding design and testing--yes, we did a ton of groundwork getting most of the "invention" done before coming to Kickstarter. No, that's not all the design and testing that's necessary to take a product from prototype (the units we showed in the video and in the photos) to production (the units that you'll wear on your wrist). Prototypes are really cool--but somewhat rough things. Our prototypes didn't have backlights. Their watch cases were prototypes--not water-tight cases. Their circuit boards were running on micros which already existed, not the awesome new dual-microcontroller architecture we designed and showed on our devboards. But we had proven out all of the concepts in prototype form over a period of a year or more before the Kickstarter campaign--so that getting to market was a case of refinement and testing and refinement, not a process of "how do we make this thing?" Regarding materials -- we have widened our test group, to test more materials. We'll talk more about these in updates. There are some differences in material compositions between 3D printed cases and molded cases--so we won't have final determinations until we test actual watch cases--but as we wrap up the material testing we can fill you in on what we've learned. Building a Qi-compatible watch has complicated this a bit because we can't just rely on tests from our premium charger...we need to also make sure we have an extra margin within the parasitic energy loss to make sure we work with any Qi-compatible charger. @Minning Xiang -- I'm really sorry that we've missed an update this month. We're spending more than full time getting AGENT rewards ready for you, and I didn't block out enough time in the schedule to get the mid-monthly update out to you. We will keep you updated as we pass milestones--many of which are going to happen pretty quickly. We may need to post some of those online on Facebook and ask those of you here to point them out to folks who are looking for an update, so that we can get you more info more regularly. This is our first Kickstarter campaign and we're learning here...thank you for your patience while we juggle an enormous project, work with suppliers, and try our best to keep you up to date regularly. We really appreciate your enthusiasm about the updates--and we want to find ways to get you more of them, more frequently. @Roma -- we're so glad to get that SDK update out. The .NET Micro Framework team has been working to get that out since December (and since Microsoft is headquartered in the USA and some of them are in China...they had to work around two sets of New Years holidays). We really appreciate their efforts, and we're really excited about the new features we can expose to developers. Stay tuned for some really cool capabilities that let developers do things on AGENT that lower-end watches just aren't designed to handle. @jeff -- the reason we haven't gone into detail on the backlights is because the backlights are using relatively new technology from a highly-recommended supply partner. It's a really cool technology and they've now provided us samples that work and fit in the watch--but we don't want to bring them bad press (in such a highly-public project) if they can't hit acceptable yields on their production line. We want to celebrate success, not point fingers at specific companies. If we can't make their backlights work, we will be happy to show you samples to explain why they didn't work out for our Kickstarter project--and then we'll pull in a high-quality but traditional backlight from one of our tried-and-true optoelectronics suppliers. But even then...we'll probably try to protect the original supplier so they can successfully refine their tech and get it to market without investors freaking out. We really want to see them succeed. From a spec perspective, the power consumption with those backlights is about 1/3 that of more traditional backlights. It sounds like that was something you had a question about. Regarding specific-phone-related features, how wireless induction works around metal, and all of your other questions...we are will make sure you have an opportunity to get answers to all of those questions. Sometimes we may put the answer in a future update for political, legal or practical reasons. And sometimes we may be able to share more info between updates. Generally speaking, we'll try to pack those answers into the Updates so we can focus most of our time in the lab and working with suppliers on getting the watch rewards into production. That is our #1 priority. Please let us know what questions you have and what you'd like to see in updates. We really appreciate that you don't speculate that we're dodging questions and therefore X or Y must be the reality. As we all work together to make AGENT a reality, we can create a really stellar community here: backers who created something awesome together, and can enjoy hanging out for years to come. Thank you for your support and for your enthusiasm, Jeff. We're glad to have you on our Kickstarter backer team. Wow, a lot of comments to catch up on here... A few quick things: 1. We're preparing the next update for the Updates page (which we'll post this week). 2. Our first priority, in engaging with our awesome backers, is individually responding to backer e-mails. So many of you take the time to write to us; we really appreciate you writing us and we love being able to interact with so many cool like-minded people. If you have a question which is not covered in the Updates, please e-mail us. [Sometimes we get a burst of e-mails and it takes a while to catch up--but we do try to individually answer every one of them. Thank you very much for your patience on any latency there.] 3. We've had some good progress on the backlights the last few weeks, and we've also lined up backup vendors just in case we run into any more production troubles there. We're pushing some technology boundaries with backlight technology...and that resulted in some challenges we maybe should have taken on in a future smartwatch instead of in this Kickstarter project. We are re focused on crossing the finish line--and so we've activated plans to ensure we get a high-quality backlight into your rewards either way. 4. To set good expectations regarding the Comments page: we will try to respond to many of the questions that are posted here in the Comments section. We hope we can respond to all of them. If we run out of time, responding to e-mails first, we may not be able to keep up with and respond to all of the comments. We may also cover some of the responses to Comments in the Updates. If you have specific questions and they aren't answered on the Comments page, please e-mail us. We are here for you. We want to engage with you. We're learning how to do that better as time goes on, and we appreciate your feedback as we learn through that process. Thank you all for your support -- Chris @Roma -- from Chris -- with a rubber band to "water-seal" the Glad wrap? Double-band? I'm pretty sure that Glad wrap would meet our induction requirements, unless the small amount of heat generated warped it. I'm afraid that it didn't make even the first cut onto our materials selection list though, for so many reasons. :) @Ovsep Ambartsumyan -- some case components have screw attachment points, some have seals, etc. Once we are comfortable that everything will fit together, have induction and RF test results, etc...we'll nail down the final materials for you. We'll also have some cool materials data to share. @Jussi Myllyluoma -- you are absolutely correct. Qualcomm followed in the footsteps of AGENT with their $350 Toq watch--which uses Qualcomm's proprietary wireless charging. No products in this category can use steel backs (for the same reason that pots with metal bottoms cook well on an induction stove). While we can't use steel, we'll be using a nice material for the back, similar to what Tissot and other non-commodity watch brands use for their non-metal case backs. @Roma -- great article, thanks for the link! @Dino -- as a fun price reference, the electronics inside the AGENT Smartwatch cost more than the entire watches (including watch cases) made by many of these other companies. We're incorporating a lot of cutting-edge technology inside the AGENT Smartwatch. @Dino -- on Gorilla-brand glass, we actually tested Corning's product last summer: their glass cutting house couldn't meet our precision requirements for a lens. Also, an interesting "reading between the lines" note: most of the sub-million-unit-volume products you see using Gorilla Glass are actually using the old, old Gorilla Glass technology which lacks the scratch resistance and hardness of the newer Gorilla Glass (including Gorilla Glass 3 and Gorilla Glass NBT). Corning does makes a cool product though, with a very cool brand name. -- Chris A sneak peek at the Atmel "Tech on Tour" semi-trailor. Atmel engineers will be crossing the country a bit later this year, with some AGENT electronics on board. <url>"we are evaluating several premium case materials for production watches and will select the final material based on beauty and wireless performance." We have to live within the limits of physics, FCC, etc.--but we'll pick high-grade materials from the winning material category. P.S. I hear that Unobtanium is really hard to CNC. I'd also be really worried about the insurance premium on a watch with an Unobtainum watchcase--and related customs issues. :) -- Chris @Jose -- next update coming this Saturday, late evening. I posted two mini-updates in December here in the Comments section, and are back to the regular updates starting with this weekend's update. @Akke -- yes, the holidays seem to slow almost everything down. I'm at CES in Las Vegas in meetings with a half dozen suppliers and other partners through Friday. Lots of excitement here about AGENT. I'll also have some cool charts to share from Monday's lab tests in Dallas in this week's update, for those that like diving into the technical details of tests. @Rick -- looking at your avatar, I swear I've seen you somewhere before. BTW, the FCC quotes we received from the test lab are in the ~$10,000 range, not counting IC and CE testing. Qi testing is more than $5,000 for the charger alone. We're trying to keep the combined certification test cost below $50,000 so that we can spend more of our engineering budget on product features. "Wireless" R&D can get pretty expensive. @Dino -- Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery. Along with you, our backers, we've set a very high bar for what a smartwatch can be. Once we set that bar this last summer, several companies (including the one you mentioned) have been racing to try to mimic some of the innovation and style that AGENT brings to the market. While they're rushing to try to close as much of the gap as they can, it's going to be a lot harder to mimic the innovative and much more expensive technology inside AGENT--or pre-emptively copy some of the surprises we have yet to reveal. We'll continue innovating--both with the smartwatch we're focused on now--as well as technology in the future, and they will continue chasing. And we look forward to creative new ideas from other market players, benefitting owners of all wearable technology. @Christopher, @Dominic - great feedback. For the next Kickstarter Update coming at the end of this week...I will snap at least a cameraphone photo or two of the latest watch hardware for you during this week's engineering activities. If the update ends up being too long with them, we'll post them over on Facebook and provide a link. I appreciate your feedback so far...and am looking forward to your follow-up feedback. -- Chris @Dino -- good questions. We want to include all of our backers in the process of bringing a product like this to market--so thank you for asking. A lot of this will be covered in upcoming Updates as in unfolds--so consider this a sneak peek at portions of the next few updates. On pre-production: large production runs like Xbox 360 or iPhone go through several phases of production runs. Smaller production runs (10,000s of watches in our case over a period of months) typically receive more hands-on attention and only have a small validation run before production begins. In our case, we'll be making about a dozen watches on a miniature assembly line for pre-production, and a few of those will be used for final Qi, FCC, IC and CE testing. On production: once we receive FCC certification, we can move into production. Actually we can start portions of the production as soon as we know that we passed the FCC tests and have filed paperwork...we just can't ship rewards until the FCC certification is in hand. We plan to start with shipments to early bird backers first. We have the capacity to assemble 1,000 watches per week, but the first few weeks are likely to start out slower while we optimize the process. These are premium watches so there will be a lot of hand-review during assembly. From a supplier perspective, the biggest risks there are on the custom parts (watchcase, lens, backlight, coil). We have already received non-custom smartwatch components from our suppliers (microcontrollers, memory displays, light sensors and accelerometers, tons of capacitors and resistors, etc.). On lens materials...the official specification is anti-glare watch glass (see specs on project home page). We have some even nicer lens materials on hand and will be testing them with the pre-production samples. If we can offer an extra upgrade to backers here, that would be really cool. We cannot commit to any potential upgrades until we know that our wireless performance is within specification with those materials. So plan on the anti-glare watch glass specified on the project home page, and if we can add yet another upgrade to this product then you'll be pleasantly surprised :) On watchcase materials...the watchcase is made up of several pieces (lens, bezel, main part of the case, buttons, caseback). The lens and bezel must be RF-permissive to enable Bluetooth communication. The caseback generally speaking must be non-conductive to enable wireless charging. Our preferred construction materials continue to be high-quality polycarbonates and stainless steel. We ordered expensive CNC-milled Stainless Steel 316 case samples in December for our wireless charging tests. The results of the wireless charging and wireless antenna tests will rule in or out which materials we can physically use. We're testing traditinoally-wireless-unfriendly materials just in case we can make them work...we're pushing technology boundaries here. @Tammy -- we're currently working with our backlight supplier to make adjustments to the AGENT Smartwatch's backlight. As reported in our November update, we had estimated completion of that task in October--but it has taken quite a bit longer than any of us anticipated. We expect the backlight modifications to be wrapped up in the next few weeks. Once the modified backlights pass our tests, we'll be able to assemble final samples, do FCC/IC/CE certifications, and move the AGENT Smartwatch onto the production line. That process is expected to take approximately 60 days. [And if the backlight is delayed further, we have established backup vendors and contingency plans.] @Roma -- thank you for the question. The remainder of our certification schedule (and start-of-production) is based on receipt of backlight samples which meet our specifications. Once our backlight supplier has completed the required changes, we can move forward with final PCBs, tooling, certifications, etc. There is roughly a sixty day process after we sign off on this final component (tooling, validation and a week of FCC tests). We estimate that we will receive production-quality backlights this month, which tracks for start of production during the second half of Q1 2014 (this quarter). If there are additional delays in backlight delivery, this will correspondingly affect that estimate (since we will either need to go through another round of tweaks or move to a backup supplier). In October, when the production-ready backlights didn't arrive as scheduled, we wanted to make sure that our backers knew about the delay and that this would affect the production schedule. As soon as we have production-ready backlights in hand, I'll be sure to post about that too so we can celebrate that milestone together. Then we get to move forward to certification, production, and reward delivery. That's the fun part. I know that our backers are extremely eager to get AGENT Smartwatches onto their wrists. We are driven to make that happen expeditiously. The wristwear we're building here together is a really terrific piece of technology and fashion. And while I'm unhappy that we've run into some of the risks and challenges we were trying to avoid, I'm also going to be really happy when backers' faces light up when they first power up their new AGENT gear. We won't rest until we get there. If there are any questions about the road to production, please let me know. We will continue posting official project updates at least once or twice a month, and I want to make sure we include the information there that is most important to our backers. Thank you as always for your support and also for the kind words, - Chris @Ralf Boeck, @Trond Klakken -- typo correction: that should be "FCC/IC/CE" testing, not "FCC/IC/UL". We do UL testing on some Secret Labs products, but those are generally high-voltage devices. @George -- We believe that quality is in the details. One of those details is the charging experience. We designed a custom Qi-enabled charger because we want your smartwatch charging experience to be best-in-class. Hopefully you never need to appreciate those details because it "just works" :) @Wayne Daniells -- stay tuned for the next few updates, especially those posted over on the Updates page. We have lots to share; we just tend to share it once each milestone is complete. Since all the pre-requisites for the charger are done, it has gotten more face time--but that will change quickly. Thanks for the feedback, and for following along with the project updates. @Joshua Ayes, @Stephen Mitchell, @Gaetan Gueraud -- we're posting quick mini-updates here on the Comments page between the detailed updates over on the Updates section. We'll have a new update for the Updates page by the end of next week. @Ralf Boeck, @Trond Klakken -- we're currently making final tweaks to backlights, cases, etc. Once those are all complete we can submit for FCC/IC/UL testing and certification. And once we pass those tests, we can go into production and start sending out watch rewards. We'll keep you updated. @W. Laging, @Chris -- watch cases are made of several parts, and we're testing induction-permissive caseback materials to enable a wireless charging window while minimizing eddy currents. A few mid-cycle updates for our backers: This week we're focused in on preparations for Qi pre-certification testing. We have booked wireless power test equipment for next Monday, and I'm traveling cross-country to evaluate the test results in person. To ensure accurate test results, we ordered quick-turn clear polycarbonate shells for the now-thinner chargers last week; and yesterday I received confirmation that those are scheduled for delivery to us by Friday. The quick-mold companies are only open three days a week last week and this week, so we appreciate them accommodating us. For the remainder of this week, our engineering team will be diving deep into the part of the wireless charging firmware which auto-detects the presence of the watch (or other Qi device) while minimizing "vampire" power consumption. We should have all related firmware tweaks locked down by the end of the week. I'll post more details on the latest project news (and Qi pre-certification test results) by the end of next week, via a regular update in the Updates section. Happy holidays, everyone. Chris A few quick mid-cycle updates for our awesome backers: These last few weeks we've been intensely focused on getting the AGENT Smartwatch, its companion wireless charger, and our premium watch case material candidates ready for Qi pre-certification tests. We have made the charger shell a bit slimmer in the process, reduced charging time slightly and enhanced charger safety. We are running preliminary sniffer tests here in New York and then heading cross-country for more detailed Qi pre-certification testing in a little over a week. We've also been adding some features to the AGENT SDK, finalizing the battery gauge calibration, working on backlight tweaks and more. We'll have more details in the next update over on the Updates page. And one holiday surprise, for AGENT Smartwatch app developers who love Visual Studio 2013: <url>#15 and the clarified some more in the update comments. If you have any specific questions, please post them there and we'll do our best to answer. We want to include you and we want to make sure you have the info you need to understand the process of bringing a product like this to production. @Christopher Burnett -- we're trying to run a different kind of Kickstarter campaign where we set good expectations and keep you involved--but we're definitely not perfect. We are trying though, working lots of late nights and pushing our suppliers really hard to deliver for us and for you. We are here listening, and we are looking forward to your hopefully-very-happy feedback when you receive your reward. And mostly, we hope you will be involved in the AGENT community for years to come. Our backers seem to be pretty awesome and we'd love to hang out with you all long-term and build a community together. @Minning Xiang, @Robert Holbert -- from Chris -- it's my fault for setting an expectation of Wednesday night for this week's update without leaving any wiggle room before the holiday; please accept my sincere apologies. We were up, after engineering meetings, from 10pm EST until around 4am writing, editing and posting an update but then ran into some technical troubles and reboot that wiped everything out. Being 4am and the Thanksgiving holiday, we disbanded for the night and then got back together this weekend around 7pm PST and rewrote everything. Again, sorry to keep you waiting. If there are details in the update which we missed, please let me know. For us, the Kickstarter Updates are like chapters in an unfolding documentary on the making of a groundbreaking product. If you'd like more frequent updates, we can share the smaller and breaking-news details here in the Comments section, linking to the forums or our Facebook page when the update includes media content. We want you all to be included and, unlike the main updates, quick updates are really quick to post. I can hear your passion and your enthusiasm in your posts--as well as your expectations. Thank you for both. and... @Harley -- Happy thanksgiving to you too :) @Joseph Lee, @Wong Kuan Suan -- we plan to send out the Kickstarter survey later this year once we have production samples and photos with straps in each color and material. We only get to send out one survey--so we want to make sure we get you the best information so you can personalize your watch reward. @Elad Rokach -- thanks for the PM! Let me know if we missed anything or can help further. -- Chris @Claudio Ibarra -- we'll ask for your shipping address in the upcoming Kickstarter survey, but if you move you're welcome to PM us with your new address and we'll make sure we update our records. @eliter1 -- the custom wireless power coils and backlights are coming in a month or so behind their estimated schedule; final case molds and certification can begin once those are ready--and production can begin once certification is complete. We'll keep you updated on remaining milestones in the schedule (qi pre-test, casemolds, production samples, qi/fcc/ce/ic testing, start of assembly, etc.) as the final pieces come together. @Minning Xiang -- coming soon; we're about four hours into writing, editing and taking photos for this week's update and have a few hours left to go. Thank you for your enthusiasm and my apologies for building up your anticipation. This week's update is about the new SDK and the wireless coils we just received; you can drop by the forums and Facebook for more info if you would like an early peek at the SDK. -- Chris @ymilord, @Dominic -- the next update will primarily focus on the November Preview SDK. Over the next few weeks we can shoot more cameraphone videos of apps and post those on Facebook or the developer forums. And once the production samples are assembled, we can do a few UI walkthroughs. Lots of cool stuff to be revealed still :) @Adam Dzak, @Minning Xiang -- we'll have more to share on how the app store will work after we wrap up the 20-Nov Preview SDK update (which enables sensor access for watch apps). But basically...you'll be able to download watch apps to your AGENT Smartwatch via the companion mobile phone AGENT app. @Robert Holbert, Alex -- we do plan on starting deliveries with our early bird backers. On delivery dates for rewards, we're working with our backlight and wireless coil suppliers to expedite things...and should have a better understanding of timeline effects next week. There are a lot of meetings going on this week at the senior management level with our suppliers. :) @Roma -- today we're still using the same case size as the prototype watches; the dimensions may be tweaked a bit after we finish testing the backlight and power coils, if necessary. @Ali Al Rahma -- we generally recommend that you don't go swimming with a watch rated at less than 10 ATM. Scuba diving generally requires 20 ATM or more. You'll be able to wear your AGENT Smartwatch while doing dishes, dancing in the rain, etc. We will have specific figures and guidance once the production samples arrive and are ATM-tested. On straps: I wear my leather strap on my Bedlam watch around water all the time without worries. If you're going to be submerging your watch in water frequently, you may prefer a silicon rubber strap. It's largely a personal preference item. -- Chris @Andy -- great question. We're definitely paying attention to all aspects of the design, including the watchcase quality. The Bedlam watches do have a 10 ATM rating, enabled in part with the round metal screw-on caseback. 10 ATM is a pretty aggressive rating and I don't want to set expectations of scuba-diving with a non-dive watch. We'll have better numbers on watchcase ATM ratings once the first samples arrive. @Roma -- it would have been great to meet you! Please feel free to drop by next time you're in town! Remember...your AGENT Smartwatch will do fine in the NYC rain, but you'll want to bring an umbrella for the post-Subway ascent :) @Nick Martin -- we will be conducting FCC certification and CE directive testing simultaneously. I just responded to your comment on update #14, with some extra details for you. -- Chris @Dino -- The wireless charger we designed for AGENT should charge any Qi enabled phone. We've designed it to be the best Qi charger on the market, compliant with the latest Qi 1.1 standard. We're making extra chargers, and will make sure you can get one of the extras with your "watch only" reward. @Huang Mu-Ti, @Edward Wilcox -- with the built-in accelerometer, apps could certainly provide lots of FitBit-like capabilities. We specifically architected the dual-processor architecture to enable scenarios like these. @Minning Xiang -- Halloween-related congestion in NYC physically slowed us down a bit last night; Halloween-night update is in progress and will be posted after engineering meetings tonight. Thank you. @Mirco Klein -- that's a scenario that you'll probably need to test. Bluetooth works, generally speaking, with a master/slave relationship. The phone can't control AGENT via AVRCP since the watch isn't a music player. But both your phone and AGENT could, conceivably, control the same device if that device supported two simultaneous masters. Now if you have your phone playing music on Bluetooth speakers (phone as master) and AGENT controlling your phone (phone as slave), there's a good chance that your phone will support that. @Alex Zora -- just to clarify, that last post was in response to your question: AGENT is compatible with iPhone 4S or newer, so that includes iPhone 5 and iPhone 5C and iPhone 5S. @Alex Zora -- AGENT will be compatible with iOS7 and iPhone 5S. There are some new Bluetooth and state features in iOS7, and we're looking into how we can take advantage of those as well. We're only doing apps for phones (and Windows tablets) at this time, but there's no reason you couldn't make a custom Bluetooth app on a Mac talking to an AGENT Smartwatch. @Richard Pope -- the RGB LED on the charger will let you know if your device is seated properly or not. Right now we're using yellow as "device found, but not centered" and white as "centered, charging." @Mirco -- AGENT can connect to multiple devices as a master, so it could connect to multiple devices at the same time. The Bluetooth slave connections are saved for the AGENT Smartwatch companion app and debug environment. At launch, you can only have one app synced with AGENT at the same time (which helps avoid confusion between your phone and tablet). On FCC...we're still getting a feel for how the 16 day shutdown and backlog is affecting timelines on FCC approvals. We'll update you on schedules next week on Halloween. @derek williams -- we have a few more usability tests to run on that topic, and we'll be sure to dive into that more in a future update. @Dominic -- update #13 will be up in about 24 hours. We've been tuning power management and working on sensor SDK support; stay tuned. There's a lot going on next week, so update #14 will be posted on Halloween night. @Cesar Del Pino -- from Chris -- I can tell that you're very excited about one specific item :) The FCC is closed right now, as part of the US government shutdown. In the meantime, we are doing "design for FCC" and even prepping pre-testing of components. If you're in the USA or have friends in the USA, I encourage you to call a state senator and ask them to kindly reopen the government...or at least the FCC :) See <url>#12 now posted :) Thank you for your enthusiasm. Thank you to all the backers who dropped by at MakerFaire NY last weekend to check out all-things-AGENT. As usual, it was awesome meeting you offline and sharing in your excitement. We'll be updating all of our backers on the latest and greatest this weekend (probably Sunday evening). We have several new things to cover (smartwatch, accessories and technology enhancements). @Nicholas -- that's a great idea. Let's revisit that once the first production watch cases arrive. The wireless charger PCBs just arrived, so we took a quick photo and posted it on our Facebook page: <url>"watchstrap selection and shipping address" survey a bit later in the year, once we have samples of each of the watchstraps for you to pick from. If you move between now and then, no worries. Speaking of watchstraps...we have some cool news there. More on that coming in our update next week :) @Cesar Del Pino -- the memory display we're using it made by Sharp. We've had really good experiences with it so far. The first boxes of production screens have already started to arrive so we're pretty excited about that too. @ATM -- we looked at NFC and RFID for the AGENT Smartwatch, but neither of them met our design goals. We are continuing to evaluate them (and other technologies) for potential use in future products. We tend to use a lot of tested-but-cutting-edge technology around here. @Hafeez Hussain -- There are schedule risks with any technology project, but we're moving aggressively to move AGENT onto the assembly line as described in our original estimated schedule. We have ordered most of the long-lead-time items already (some of the molds, long-lead-time cutting-edge microchips, CNC-milled validation plastics for the charger, etc.) and will be buttoning more down later this month. We'll be sure to keep our backers in the loop as manufacturing schedules get solidified. Thank you for your enthusiasm and support! @Winnafred -- it's cool that others are out there coming up with innovative ideas. We wish them the best with their concepts and products. That said, we are very excited to be bringing the world's smartest watch to market, complete with fashion-forward design and a host of watch-bound innovations to wristwear. Like a safe app platform and amazing developer tools and long battery life, wireless charging, dual-processors, accurate battery gauges, and weather feeds. Plus a whole lot more. In the end AGENT is several years ahead of the industry, technology wise. Will others catch up? Sure, maybe. But we, with the AGENT community, will continue to innovate and help provide thought leadership in the wearables industry. We're really excited to be taking this journey with all of you. @Hafeez Hussain -- we're going to try to make it possible for backers to pre-order a charger later this year. And then ship that charger with your "watch-only" reward. We just don't want to slow down the shipping or affect backers who selected the "watch + charger" rewards. We're going to discuss this further internally to determine the best way to handle the add-on. Right now we're going to order more extra parts. We'll update you on strategy for add-ons in an update prior to the Kickstarter survey, for sure. Thank you very much for your enthusiasm :) @All backers (including Ovsep): update 10 is now live. RGB LEDs, charging coils and design-for-manufacturing <url>"offer pre-orders" and the reviewers tend to notice them because of that. We'll ramp up our media outreach as well, especially as we approach delivery. @Alan Claver -- no worries, we're definitely supporting iOS users as well. We'll have some iPhone love for you in an update later this year, before watches ship. :) @Jeffrey Bernt - AGENT supports both Classic Bluetooth and Bluetooth Smart (LE). You'll be able to use the newer Bluetooth Smart (LE) fitness devices with compatible AGENT watch apps. @Kristan Broumana, You can dance in the rain with your AGENT watch, wash your hands, and immerse it in water. We won't know the exact ATM until we build the final case molds and test the final seals. No diving though. That's a completely different kind of watch design. BTW, here is a good online resource regarding watch ATM ratings and water activities: <url>#, you'll probably see a lot of Windows Phone samples and conversation here and in the forums--but we will make sure that Android and iPhone users are supported well too. @Dino -- :) We'll be posting Update #8 by tomorrow night. For those that haven't been following the comments, we'll talk about the Preview SDK, AGENT Forums and Windows 8.1 (tablet and PC) support. And one exciting milestone which we hit this week... @Roma -- backer rewards are our priority and will be fulfilled first--and then we will take care of the later pre-orders and retail sales. We know who made AGENT possible--and you and your rewards are our first priority. @Dino -- we'll be posting updates at least twice a month, keeping you up to date with progress and AGENT-related news--more often in some cases when there is a lot to talk about. And while much of the latest news will be developer-related--so you may find out about some of it first in discussions on the AGENT forums---we'll try to keep non-developer related updates here on Kickstarter to keep all backers updated. Quite a bit going on (SDK and Emulator preview, BUILD, Windows 8.1 support, engineering progress, etc.) so we'll be sure to post update #8 within a week to share the latest :) Thank you for your enthusiasm; we're excited to be here on Kickstarter, engaging with our amazing backers. From Chris -- thank you to the dozens of backers attending BUILD this week who stopped by and said hello :) It was great meeting you and walking through sample projects with you. @Kian Way -- sorry, your account got flagged by the forums software so it wasn't letting you in. We've manually activated your account. Please let us know if you have any troubles logging into the forums now. Thanks! @Alex Balcanquall -- thank you for stopping by and saying hello at BUILD! @Teo Buckingham -- if you'd like to learn how to code, drop by the AGENT forums (at forums.agentwatches.com) and we can give you a few recommendations on where to start. From Chris -- for those of you at Microsoft BUILD this week in San Francisco: please come say hello :) We're in the Visual Studio partners area of Moscone North, along the back wall. We're on the opposite end of the room from the Hackathon. Quite a few AGENT backers have already dropped by; it's been a lot of fun meeting all of you! @Rouven Brandau -- thank you for correcting my link. Yes, that's it :) Rob D -- unfortunately we don't have any way to process pledges outside of the Kickstarter/Amazon system. But we understand, and we can get you a place at the front of the reservation line for post-Kickstarter watches. You have PM :) @Paul -- great ideas on lost phone link. For now we're focused on "link lost" but those would be great features for future firmware updates. Direction is hard with a single phone signal but in locations with Bluetooth location beacons even #4 could be possible. @Gaetan Gueraud -- we will be water-resistance-testing watches a bit later this year once we have production watch cases. You'll be able to dance in the rain, wash your hands, immerse your watch in water, etc. @Vladimir Kostek -- good idea, let's take some photos once the first production watchcases arrive. BTW dimensions of the prototype watchcases are on our main Kickstarter page. @John Christman -- can you request that on the forums (www.agentforums.com) and we can start the conversation about how best to support remote photo shutter apps? Chris @Joshua Loke -- fixed :) Let us know if the forums are/are not working for you now. @Kian Way -- you have PM. Please let me know your username via direct message and we'll get you set up. Thanks! @Ingo Mueller -- we will be working with several backers and customs experts to help ensure that the necessary paperwork is included, etc. @Alex Ferrandis -- we're going to take photos of the final watchstraps on AGENT watches later this year, and will then send out surveys to choose watchstrap material, size, and accent-stitching color. We want to make sure you have good photos so that you can pick the one that's best for you. @Christopher Meier -- we can look at further enhancing accessibility support in the future. Right now we're focused on vision-related needs (large fonts, etc.). We need to limit scope for the first release, but we definitely want to see what we can do to make AGENT work great for users with additional accessibility needs. @Developers We have updated the SDK to v0.1.1. This minor update fixes a cosmetic issue (improper font-size-related scaling) on the AGENT Emulator. We also signed the new SDK installer with our Secret Labs code signing certificate. Available now for download from <url>"out of the box" :) We may also put one or two more apps on there by default, like the default exercise app. All non-core apps (e.g. weather, exercise, music control) will be removable as well. @Erik Noren -- Awesome. The 0.1.1 and newer SDK installers will be digitally signed by Secret Labs. We have a small cosmetic update for the Emulator coming soon in 0.1.1; stay tuned. @Roma -- the watch app store will be largely community moderated to start with. There will be some basic rules (mostly to keep things family friends and ensure that apps are written well). If apps don't meet those criteria, you can side-load them. It will be an open ecosystem. One of the biggest benefits of using a managed runtime is that apps are sandboxed. We want you to be able to run apps without worrying about hurting your watch. If your watch gives you warnings that an app is consuming an abnormal amount of power or an app that you want to download looks sketchy--well follow common sense there :) We think that there will be lots of free apps, maybe almost all of them. If devs want to charge for apps, they can do so through any traditional mechanism or through a third-party app store. @Robert Chartier -- thank you for sharing your contrib project! @Ed Hagopian -- just FYI, we will be exposing a Button class in the near future to handle button presses. For now you can use InterruptPort--but this is a short-term thing for developers who want to get started now. @Kueh -- we will be providing a number of AGENT-specific assemblies in SDK refreshes. Right now our focus is on getting developers started with the basics--and then listening to feedback to make sure we expose superclasses, additional classes, etc. in a way that works well for developers. @Dominic Jossen -- Big Digits with an extra bit of animation? Please share! @Rakansen77 -- PowerState.CurrentPowerLevel returns the current power-consumption-state of a micro framework device. I think you're looking for the Battery class: <url>"# of new comments" link you can click to show the new comments. Does that help, or is that what you're already doing? @Mike Cattle -- the bold for the hour is a nice effect. You're quick! Thanks for sharing. @Rainer Prem -- from Chris -- we'll be setting up online forums by the end of next week (as previously committed). Our focus was on getting the SDK preview out first. Next up is getting forums set up, helping with blog posts and tutorials, getting a tech writer onboard, etc. We are going to be a bit of a balancing act between making sure we keep engineering on track internally, share cool snapshots of engineering as we go towards production, and support app development through the forums. The first of those three being our biggest priority, but the others being important too. It's going to be a busy year, with lots of fun community engagement. @Maxim Enbaev -- there's actually no signature on the installer, so that's probably what Kapersky is complaining about. We didn't sign or delay-sign the preview SDK installer. We'll sign the next version. @Maxim Enbaev -- signing the installer requires an extra process that would have delayed the SDK release; we'll get it signed with our Secret Labs Authenticode key for the next version so that Kapersky isn't grumpy :) @Dude. -- from Chris -- "Expert .NET Micro Framework" is one of my favorite .NET MF resources. Here's a direct link to the newer Second Edition (which is also on Amazon): <url>"COM1" in your app using the System.IO.Ports.SerialPort class. You'll also need to modify the emulator's XML configuration file at: C:\Program Files (x86)\Secret Labs\AGENT SDK\Emulator\v4.3\AGENT Emulator.exe.emulatorconfig Look for the "PhysicalPortName" entry and change it from COM5 to the Bluetooth Serial Port you've configured on your PC. Your smartphone apps should see the emulator's Bluetooth Serial Port the same way as they see it on a watch :) Software Developers: The preview AGENT SDK installer (including preview AGENT Emulator) is now live :) <url>#tools This first preview release includes templates for AGENT Watch Apps and AGENT Watch Faces. We put some default code in there to get you started. Over the next few months, we will release a regular set of SDK updates as we move from preview mode to beta mode to release. We will be incorporating your feedback, exposing more features, etc. We will be testing new SDK features on our AGENT validation boards at the same time :) Robert Chartier wrote a great blog post on getting started with the preview SDK here. More to come, including developer forums next week! <url>"Contact me" link on the right side and we'll see if there's anything we can do to help. Thank you. One quick note: we've started receiving e-mails asking about how to pre-order watches. We put a quick note on our project's Kickstarter home page about post-Kickstarter watches, and we wanted to share our plans with our backers first before anyone else. Most importantly: for the next few days we're going to be focused on taking care of our backers and supporting developers as they start working with the preview SDK. After that: in the next week or two we'll set up a reservation system so that future AGENT owners can sign up to be first in line for pre-orders. Those pre-orders will be at the estimated MSRPs established in the reward tier text. Backer rewards are our priority and will be fulfilled first--and then we will take care of the later pre-orders. We know who made AGENT possible--and you and your rewards are our first priority. @Ali Al Rahma -- I've always wanted to visit Dubai! That might be a bit of an expensive place to hold a hackathon though? @Mike Pang -- no worries. As long as your pledge amount qualifies for the reward, we can fix that manually on our end to make sure you get the right reward. Just PM us and we'll take care of you. To our beloved backers: Wow, what an amazing 30 days. And what an amazing group of backers! We're humbled--and we are so excited that we can now move AGENT out of the lab and onto the assembly line. We're doing something great here, together. So very cool. For the next few hours we'll be preparing to post the installer for the early access Preview SDK. We need to get that out tonight, so we may be offline for a bit here. We will send out Update #8 once it's live--and we will be here for you throughout the year. Again--thank you all for making the AGENT Smartwatch a reality. We can't wait to see these watches on your wrists, all around the world! @Paul -- we'll assemble sample watches (with production circuitry, lenses, and sample watchcases) and conduct RF testing on them later this summer; those test results will give us the info we need to select the best material options. @Nick Martin -- estimated delivery dates are based on an engineering and production schedule which took into account years of experience building electronics, watches, etc. I don't know how to put a % on that :) We'll be heads-down for the next five months super-focused on getting watches onto the assembly line and supporting app developer. If we run into unexpected delays, we will keep you in the loop. @Mervyn Lee -- we're going to try to make the Bluetooth Low Energy proximity sensing variable, so that you can set a virtual "leash range" to your phone. With our prototypes it's basically an "out of range" indicator but our new dual-mode radio gives us a lot more flexibility :) @Mervyn Lee -- features like Caller ID and music control (which use Classic Bluetooth) will get traditional Bluetooth range (~10 meters class spec). Other features such as smartphone-to-smartwatch communication may get you better range, with Bluetooth Low Energy. But this isn't WiFi...if you're linked to a device you'll want to be in the vicinity. @Mervyn Lee -- your iPhone 4S has both Classic Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy. They're different technologies, now in the same family. Most of your existing accessories will be using Classic Bluetooth (with its traditional range). @Samuli Alajärvelä -- luckily we've been building programmable software platforms for three years, have much of our assembly chain already in use (for Netduino) and locked down, and already have the OS up and running on our production circuitry. We move pretty quickly around here, and we'll be sharing our progress with you. Tonight's SDK and Emulator launch is the early-access preview. It contains the tools developers need to start developing Bluetooth-connected apps and watchfaces, and we'll be using the feedback from our developer community to expose additional features, create additional UI elements, establish best practices, etc. The extra Kickstarter funds are also enabling us to hire a technical writer to flesh out the documentation as we go. And we'll be building tutorials. By the time the final v1.0 SDK ships this autumn, it should be pretty awesome :) Chris @Mervyn Lee -- great question. Bluetooth link range depends on your phone's antenna and your type of connection (Classic Bluetooth vs. Bluetooth Low Energy). If your phone supports Bluetooth Low Energy we can get to a pretty decent range--and we can also do quasi-distance measurement. If your phone only supports Classic Bluetooth, then the range is the traditional 10 meters line-of-sight. @Roma -- from Chris -- I know that you had a bit of a rough experience with a smartwatch vendor last year. I appreciate your enthusiasm and I empathize with your frustration. If you need to vent about previous experiences, please feel free to PM me. We'd really like our collective home on Kickstarter to be an optimistic community home where we can build great things together, and we'd like to avoid tearing others down. We'd much rather learn from others' experiences and try to raise the bar and live an even better standard. Thank you so much for your support. We're glad to have your experience and wisdom on our team. @Lane Sutton -- with AGENT, we wanted to make a premium watch and focus on empowering software developers to make amazing watch apps. We also wanted to make it beautiful. We wanted a watch with no compromises. I can't speak for other watch companies or their products, but here are a few of the things that differentiate AGENT generally from other smartwatch designs: 7 days battery life (typical), 30 days battery life (watchface-only mode); energy-smart dual-processor design with 900% more efficient core power consumption in sleep mode; fashion design by House of Horology; native international character support (Cyrillic, Chinese, Hebrew, etc.); glass lens; 2-year warranty. Also: powerful on-watch apps running in a safe managed code environment; garbage collection to prevent memory leaks; multiple backup and recovery modes (i.e. apps cannot brick your watch); cutting edge energy management; real battery gauge; wireless charging. More for developers: hackathons and emulators and amazing free development tools. And more, like the just-announced app store, made possible by the generous extra funding from our backers. And a premium weather feed. In the end we're building a premium smartwatch here, together, designed to move the smartwatch industry forward. Thank you very much or your support! @Ben Groot -- We love Vancouver, but it's in another country. That means that many of our west coast US backers (without passports) wouldn't be able to attend, and costs and complications go way up with international events. If we can host a Canadian event in the future, we would love to do one in Vancouver--such a beautiful city. @François -- from Chris -- thank you so much for the offer! @Nathan Vergin -- you are exactly right about cost of overseas vs domestic events; thank you for bringing that up. If we can find an event organizer and event space sponsor in Europe, a European hackathon (for our app developer backers) is within our budget. We'd love to visit Chucky and his friends in Oceania, and I'd love to visit our Asian and South American and African (and Antarctic?) backers someday too--but that would need to wait until after watches start shipping. @Mike Hole -- from Chris -- you rock! High five :) @Robert Chartier -- Vancouver might be a long flight for a lot of Europeans :) For a potential west coast event, we're looking at either Seattle or San Francisco. We would need an event space sponsor--but we would love to have three hackathons before watches ship (NYC, west coast USA, and Europe). @Mike Hole -- hosting an event at Nokia (or one of Microsoft's offices in Europe) would be amazing, if that were an available option. We would want to take a poll of our European backers as to location--we'd want to make it convenient for many backers. @Mike Hole -- from Chris -- we'd love to do a hackathon somewhere in Europe as well. We'd need an event space sponsor and maybe an organizer host. Maybe we could team up with a European mini-MakerFaire event? I'd love to come meet some of you personally! @CK -- Both Qi and the charger in the watch are smart: they won't draw more current from your Qi charger than the battery needs for charging. For smartphones, a charger with more amperage can mean a faster charge--but AGENT's battery is small so its fast charge mode takes much less current. Any Qi charger will do :) Wow. $1 million. You all are so amazing. Thank you so much. This provides us with enough extra funds to hold the NYC hackathon--and maybe a second one on the west coast too (if we can find an event space sponsor). Woot! :) We're building something great here, together. Thank you all so much for your support. @tj27 -- from Chris -- I just sent you a message. We don't have multi-packs or strap add-ons, but I can get you free shipping on a watchstrap later this year when they're available for sale. We'll take care of you. :) @kja2ja -- from Chris -- your first watchface design is awesomely cryptic. I think that most backers will probably use easy-to-read ones most of the time--but I am pretty in love with the cool cryptic options too :) I can't wait to see what you come up with next. @Mike Cattle -- as @Robert Chartier alluded, we will be adding a global setting for 12/24 hour. That way users can set their preference once and then all their watch faces will match their preference automatically. For now, for early watchface development purposes, your idea of using the middle button to toggle is smart. :) @Lawrence Villanueva -- you don't need to learn to code to have cool watchfaces and watch apps on your AGENT smartwatch. The community will take care of building cool ones for you. Most people who own AGENT smartwatches probably won't know how to code--and that's perfectly fine :) This is a consumer product like smartphones--designed for a rich ecosystem of apps. That said--coding can be a lot of fun. So you're welcome to come learn :) @Lawrence Villanueva -- oh my, that looks REALLY cool. @Devpaal Singh -- December and January watch rewards are identical except for delivery time. If you already have a Qi-compliant charging pad, it should work with the AGENT smartwatch. We do recommend charging pads with auto-centering magnets, for the most efficient charging. @Roman Kadlec -- thank you. We just opened up the January "watch only" reward tier. @Millie -- I'm not going to ask how you can type if you can't push buttons :) On-screen keyboard? @Felicite -- I wish you had an AGENT watch on your wrist already; you could run a countdown app and it would count the seconds for you :) @Kueh -- working on a few WP8 videos, and a few videos of watchfaces for backers. Some of the WP8 goodies include sample apps to seed WP8 developers with ideas and code. Music control is up first. But before that...we're wrapping up the SDK installer so we can get that launched later today. We have a ton of requests, but we're trying to get to all of them; thank you very much for your patience. @Lawrence Villanueva -- smartphones have flexibility in how they support accept/reject/silence call features. If your particular phone supports accept call we will expose that feature, but in most circumstances it's the reject and silence features that will be most useful. @Mike Fennell -- the AGENT Emulator is a desktop application; you could always "remote desktop" to your computer from your phone :) @Dino -- let's see what we can do to build that into the core feature set. To date we've focused on caller ID and accept/reject/silence call--but quick text responses would be a really useful enhancement. @Matheus Oosthuysen -- from Chris -- that is a pretty fun concept. Reminds me of flying down a TRON-like tunnel. And yes, that type of style and animation could definitely be done with an AGENT smartwatch. @Robert Chartier -- nice! BTW you can press the up and down arrows on your keyboard for up/down and you can press the ENTER key for select. Mouse clicks also work. @Jeff Lefebvre -- we're doing final testing on the preview (early-access) SDK and emulator right now. We gave a copy to a few super-active backers to make sure it's performing in the real-world like it's performing in the lab :) The preview SDK should be live at www.agentwatches.com tomorrow evening. @Graham Murray -- wow, you are doing a lot of animating in there :) Very cool. Yeah, that's going to be a bit power hungry :) As we prepare AGENT for production, we will be moving our display driver's update logic from software (during your Bitmap.Flush() call) to hardware (DMA transfers in the background) so this sample will be an awesome way to measure our optimizations :) :) @Ovsep Ambartsumyan -- for third-party Qi chargers, we usually recommend the Nokia DT-900 charging pad: <url>"pulse patterns" as well. @Nick Vuono -- we're looking into options regarding an HTTP Proxy on your smartphone; I know that a few community members are already looking at building generic ones (using Bluetooth SPP). We're looking forward to developer feedback so we can provide the tools you need to realize your creative watch app ambitions :) @Graham Murray -- from Chris -- the HTML version looks awesome! We're getting the installer ready for the early-access SDK and emulator at the moment--but I will load your orbit code and test it out later for sure. I can't wait to see it, and I can offer some energy-saving advice. @Mike Cattle -- from Chris -- we are going to put together some documentation on how to side-load apps directly from smartphone apps. So very possible. We'll also have a watch app store. Using the watch's accelerometer to track motion and play light saber noises on one's phone...where do I sign up?!? P.S. Cool hat. I grew up in Idaho and we had cool hats. Here in NYC--they're more hipster-ish. Still cool, just not the same. @Jon Galloway -- from Chris -- I just read your post. You are a hilarious man. Thank you for digging in already :) @Jeroen -- as we continue raising funds, we will be able to continue providing even more developer support and even more features for AGENT smartwatches. Thank you for your support. @Robert Chartier -- as a community we can work together to provide options like that, to make AGENT even better together. No need for stretch goals to achieve a good user experience. @Russell Sakolsky -- AGENT games? Very cool! I look forward to playing them :) @Jaizuke -- there may be some practical limit as to how many watchfaces or apps are easy to navigate to on a smartwatch--but that's certainly more than eight :) We've been measuring the size of a lot of the watchfaces that developers have been working on and technically we can fit more than a hundred of those on the watch. We'll establish some best practices as we go on this journey together. @Mohamed Ali -- we can ship to any country which is not under USA embargo. We cannot ship to North Korea for instance. Saudi Arabia is good to go. @CK -- we are going to try to have extra chargers available around the time that watch rewards start shipping to backers, but we can't make any promises. The first ones will be reserved for backer rewards for sure. If you need to pick up a charger outside the campaign, we can recommend a few Qi-compliant charging pads. @Clive Ciappara -- we really love the resolution on this screen. Check out what Steve Bulgin was able to do with his "world map" and "chronograph" watchfaces. Pretty awesome stuff. On background--you can use a white background instead of a black background, but we recommend keeping the background black for consistency. We're creating something beautiful here, and consistency adds to that beauty. @Robert Chartier -- on your triple-face watch...you can use the middle button to cycle between those if you'd like. I'd recommend pulling out the analog watchface as a separate watch face though. Pressing the up/down buttons (right side of watch) will cycle through all the installed watchfaces--so you should get the same effect. @Robert Chartier -- from Chris -- very cool calculator :) @Matrix - Weresheep of Original Sin -- we are committed to supporting iOS, Android, and Windows Phone operating systems. iOS 7 is even better than iOS 6 as far as Bluetooth notifications go--so we're going to take advantage of that for you as well. As far as robustness goes, the watch is not a thick industrial g-shock but it is designed for daily use. @Hilary Wyckoff -- we don't have multi-pack rewards because we don't want Kickstarter to feel like a store. Please PM me and we can get you near the front of the future pre-order line for sure. @John -- some additional engineering info: the dielectric constant of Corundum is 11 (versus 4-6 for traditional watch glass) and its dielectric loss tangent is quite low. All of our candidate materials do have some RF permittivity (as does aluminum). What we'll be doing in the RF test lab is measuring range, signal loss, observed antenna patterns, etc. Lots of fun data in there, for engineering-types. @Steve Bulgin -- thanks for the link! Most backers were interested in writing code and playing with the hardware, so it's cool that that attendee focused in on the fashion side of things too! @John -- we will be RF-testing several types of scratch-resistant watch lenses in the RF lab later this year, once we have assembled pre-production watches. We have been doing some preliminary research into the dielectric constants/loss tangents of a few premium lens materials--but we won't know how they perform in real life until we test assembled units in the RF lab. We're breaking new ground here :) For app developers -- from Chris -- to augment today's emulator preview from Scott Hanselman, here is an app getting weather data from my Windows Phone :) <url>"COM1" which is mapped behind the scenes. No code changes are required for either the smartphone app or the smartwatch app to target either the AGENT Emulator and AGENT Smartwatch. :) @Robert Chartier -- from Chris -- that awesome watchface is actually House of Horology fan-art drawn by backer Steve Bulgin. We have so many awesome and talented supporters. :) @Dude. - the forums will go live within the next ten days; we're working through their configuration, etc. now. For our developer backers: Scott Hanselman posted an article on his blog today, showing how to use the AGENT Emulator. That same emulator will be posted for download on Thursday :) <url>"airplane mode" will be one of the first settings options, so it will be quick to toggle your smartwatch's Bluetooth radio. There will also be an "off" mode. @Richard -- we can cache a few notifications. A notification center is an interesting idea; let's pick up that conversation again soon as see what the user experience around that would need to look like, how much memory it would take, etc. Our target right now is showing notifications as they arrive (and queuing up a few that come in quickly), but a notification center might be something we can enable for power users. @Matthew Lawrence -- as Roma noted, your Qi charging pad will be MicroUSB powered, so you can plug it into any USB-compliant port (computer, wall adapter, etc.) @Ron Au -- we understand. Please follow along with the public updates, and stay in touch. @Jason Palacios -- EDIT: "made possible by the extra funds". @Roma -- thank you :) @Jason Palacios -- our corollary to "stretch goals" are the improvements that we're making to AGENT, made possibly the extra funds pledged by backers. We've upgraded the watchstraps (so you can choose leather in addition to silicon rubber), licensed international fonts for all watches, announced a premium weather feed, and now we're building an app store. Our hope is that these major enhancements, made possible by the generous pledges of our backers, end up being an even better value to you than the alternative. We still have a few more things we can do with additional funds; two and a half more days to go... @Rachel Cotton -- from Chris -- if you are looking for a third-party Qi charger, here is my off-the-shelf recommendation: <url>"stretch goals" with our campaign. Rather than potentially compromise both our design and our production schedule through "stretch goals", we decided to use the extra funds pledged by our backers to enhance their watches and the AGENT ecosystem in ways that don't affect the schedule and which benefit out backers. So instead of "stretch goals", we have been working day-to-day to use the extra funds in ways that serve the interests of our backers well. Extra funds have made it possible to offer a second watchstrap material (genuine leather in addition to silicon rubber), license fonts for our international backers (Russian, Japanese, Hebrew, etc.), and add a second size for watchstraps. Extra funds are also enabling us to hire a technical writer to help out with documentation, and soon we'll be able to hold a hackathon where app developers can come test their apps on real pre-production hardware, before the watches ship. That means that there will be apps available on day one when reward deliveries begin. :) @Matt -- we are going to have extra wireless chargers available for sale, but we do not know exactly what date they will be available. The first 2,100 chargers need to go to backers in December, for sure. :) We can also recommend some third-party chargers for you, around the same estimated price point. @Robert Chartier -- the preview SDK will enable you to build apps which access the screen and pushbuttons, run on the emulator, and communicate with other devices via Bluetooth Serial Port profile. It will also let you deploy your applications from Visual Studio and debug them in real-time. We'll keep updating it with new features and tweaks over the coming months, in response to developer feedback. And we'll start adding the new weather API as well as those backend services come up in beta later this year. It's going to be a lot of fun :) @Roma -- from Chris -- number, name, time, and date of caller (caller ID) should all work for you. Like many cars, we are designing around Bluetooth HFP and PBAP so that we can look up the contact information on your phone in real time. On question #2 -- that varies by phone, car kit, etc. We'll do some testing with a few different systems, but we don't know if you will be able to answer calls on your car kit via your watch. Similarly with #3 -- some phones support "reject call" and some phones do not. We'll provide the option to expose the features which your phone supports so your experience can be tailored. On #6 and #8 -- iOS 7 is changing a lot about iPhone in regards to notifications. Our smartwatch supports several forms of notifications and we'll be integrating the best notification features that iOS has to offer to Bluetooth-compliant devices. AGENT is a smartwatch with a lot of capabilities. If you're looking for an off-the-shelf product which supports a specific list of features on a specific phone running a specific OS version, I would recommend testing some real-world devices and buying one off the shelf instead. I don't want to discourage you; I just want to make sure you're happy with your decisions. I hope you'll join us, as we build a premium product with a premium user experience together. @Dude., Robert Chartier -- one of our goals with publishing the Preview SDK and Emulator on Thursday is to get those backers who are developers thinking about apps--and providing feedback on the things they need. Bluetooth Proximity support? Options screens? Accelerometer support in watchfaces? Etc. As far as options go--we are working on a UI workflow for that. The bottom-left button is the MODE/MENU button, so there will be a way to configure per-app and per-watchface settings on the device. We're looking at both code-defined and XML-defined ways to specify these options, so that they're presented to the user in a consistent format. We'll set up developer forums for you. Please let us know what you need. We'll expose APIs and create watch navigation and options screens--so that you have the tools you need to unleash your app-making creativity. @Roma -- AGENT is designed to give you notifications, rather than to act as an e-mail inbox. We have a few KB of RAM to cache the latest notifications--but we won't be able to support storing your e-mail history, etc. A third-party app could use flash storage to augment RAM and could potentially do some of that--but again our focus is on notifications rather than acting as a replacement for your phone. Our focus is on providing a premium user experience with each of the three supported smartphone platforms. If you have specific scenarios you'd like us to test, as we do unit and system testing on each of the Bluetooth profiles with various phones, we'd be happy to add a few of them to our list. There are a lot of things we can do with the AGENT OS core; we just want to make sure we don't do anything half-baked. Making you manually re-establish links constantly would not be very cool. @Christopher Meier -- the Bluetooth radio we're using on the production watches (and on our validation boards today) supports simultaneous pairings to multiple devices. So yes we can support a Bluetooth Serial Port to your computer or another device at the same time that your watch is paired to your phone. On your second question: are you asking if you can pair a headset to your phone at the same time as all of the above? If so, technically there is no good reason why you wouldn't be able to do so. We can't control the relationship between your phone and headset, but we can disable features on the smartwatch (temporarily or permanently) to help out if any relationship issues arise among your plethora of Bluetooth-connected devices. :) @Tim Veluwenkamp -- welcome to the AGENT community :) Thank you for your support! Do you already have a few ideas for watch apps? Hi Aaron, At the moment, we're super-focused on getting AGENT out of the lab and onto the assembly line. But we understand that some people are not in a position to back the project right now; after we're done fulfilling backer rewards they will be able to buy a watch from online and retail stores. After the Kickstarter campaign concludes, we will create a reservation system so that consumers can reserve their spot in line, to pre-order the watch (at full MSRP) later this year. Pre-order deliveries will begin after Kickstarter backers' reward shipments. Chris @Tae Kim -- from Chris -- I hadn't heard of HypeJar before. Thanks for the post :) @Kristjan Ulfsson -- our exercise app can read heart rate from a Bluetooth heart rate chest strap and can show elapsed distance using your smartphone's GPS signal. Third-party exercise and sports app developers have already contacted us about integrating AGENT support into their apps, so we anticipate even richer support on your wrist. Basic Bluetooth profiles enabled caller ID (like it does with car kits) and apps communicate between smartwatch and smartphone via Bluetooth Serial Port profile. We'll also be adding Bluetooth LE (GATT) communication support in the production watches, for quick and efficient transfer of short bits of data between the watch and your phone or other Bluetooth Smart devices. @Maxim Enbaev -- that could be cool for a future watch design. We have actually played with the concept of an RGBW backlight, but so far color backlighting of a memory display is not nearly as awesome in real-life as we had imagined in our minds :) @Steve Bulgin -- from Chris -- Ross Rubin (Tech Crunch) came to the Open House the other night and asked lots of great questions. We launched our campaign on "Xbox One" day and we missed much of the technology news cycle...so it's pretty cool to see the technology press start to pick up on the generational leap that is AGENT :) Thanks for the link! @Steve Bulgin -- from Chris -- oh man, that is a really cool watchface! I can't wait to see the "sun map" over that. Also--Pete Brown time made laugh. That's *great*. @Robert Chartier -- from Chris -- the 125x125 pixel QR code scanned right away (after I changed the outer 3 pixels to white--so that there was whitespace around the QR code). I almost called you to let you know ;) Please note that I'm using my Lumia 920 (Bing Visual Search) indoors at night in a somewhat-dim room. So YRMV. @Robert Chartier -- can you post a 128x128 pixel GIF of the QR code? And I'll try it? Or you can link to the full project as a ZIP? Bonus points if it is smaller than 128x128, so that there's a bit of empty space around the QR code. @Pete Brown -- thank you for the awesome blog post :) @Lawrence Villanueva -- really cool concept. We'd need to define a range of "viewing angles" where the time would appear. You'd probably want to supplement that by making it so that pressing the middle button also showed the time, perhaps with a cool animation. @Robert Chartier -- from Chris -- it would be really cool to give a watch emotions, like a Romo: <url>"erase" the current watchface like an etch-a-sketch? Using the accelerometer in watchfaces (versus watch apps) will require some tweaks to AGENT OS, since the main micro needs to wake up frequently when there is motion--and one's arms move a lot during the day while the watch is in watchface mode. Let's pull together some sample scenarios to scope what that support should look like, and see what kind of cool things we can do with watchfaces :) @Robert Chartier -- that Modern watchface is looking pretty nice. Quick note: watch apps have access to all three of the right buttons; watchfaces have access to the middle-right button. The top-right and bottom-right buttons are used to cycle between watchfaces. On gesture recognition: we'd like to enable some core gestures. Let us know what's useful, and we'll see what we can do. :) For developers: a quick 3D accelerometer demo, to get you thinking about what types of motion- and position-aware watchfaces and watch apps you want to build: <url>"regarding your last two designs" :) Very cool concepts and artwork. @Chucky -- from Chris -- the ALL-CAPS from a knife-wielding Chucky doll may be scaring watchface developers a bit. ;) I'm sure that someone would love to make a similar creative watchface; they maybe just want to know that you love and appreciate them first. On a more serious note: an animated text-based watchface would be pretty simple to create. The biggest issue is probably determining how to spell "oh" in "five o'clock", "five o' six" etc. And also what font to use. @Lawrence Villanueva -- from Chris -- regarding our last two designs...now you're just teasing us! I so want to wear both of those on my wrist today. @Maxim Enbaev -- there is a Bitmap.RotateImage function available today: <url>"home" and "away" time zone settings that all watchfaces could use. Chris @Roma -- thank you for your support! We look forward to engaging with you throughout the year :) @Irwin Wong-Sing -- several dozen people stopped by the open house tonight. The House of Horology shop was quite packed for a while :) It was quite a dichotomous group tonight: filmmakers, software developers, investors, fashion designers, animatronics experts, musicians and DJs, journalists, and more. All really cool people. Thank you to everyone who made it out to the open house. We really enjoyed spending a few hours with you, showcasing House of Horology and Secret Labs hardware--and of course playing with the AGENT gear :) P.S. To those who attended and took photos: please share them on Twitter or Facebook. We will share and retweet. @Irwin Wong-Sing -- from Chris -- we started showing off AGENT's 3D accelerometer at the open house tonight. I took a quick video of the accelerometer demo app and will post it to Facebook this weekend, for those who don't live in NYC. We also walked quite a few developers through debugging an app interactively :) We got quite a few dropped-jaw looks when developers realized that writing and debugging AGENT apps is pretty much an identical experience to developing mobile phone apps. The tools are pretty amazing. @Nicolas S Hagen -- when AGENT loses the link to your phone, it can alert you via a vibration and on-screen notification (so you know what the vibration meant). Our current vibration motor is quite strong; we're going to do some testing in the real-world to determine the optimal vibration strength. @Dino -- thank you for the kind words and for your support. @Roma -- thank you for not lumping us in with previous Kickstarter projects. There have been a lot of great projects--both during the campaigns and afterwards. And of course there have been some subpar backer experiences. We're trying to follow the path of best practices both during the campaign and afterwards--and even more than that we're here to engage our backers as a community rather than using Kickstarter as some type of pre-order store. We're here to build great things together. @BAN -- from Chris -- you can dance in the rain with your AGENT watch, wash your hands, and immerse it in water. We won't know the exact ATM rating until we build the final case molds and test the final seals. No diving though. That's a completely different kind of watch design. BTW, here is a good online resource regarding watch ATM ratings and water activities: <url>"randomly pick a new watchface every # hours" feature could be a cool "power toys" feature; let's revisit that concept in the future. @Dino -- we are definitely looking into a cool House of Horology watchface or two :) @Robert Chartier -- automated button handling; got it. This is great feedback. For watchface developers: once the preview SDK goes live in a week we will solicit more feedback and then start tuning the interfaces to support some of the most common use case scenarios automatically. @Erik Noren -- great idea. For watchface developers: we should create a method/property which changes between "seconds", "minutes", and "seconds for one minute" modes--and then changes the timer behind UpdateTime automatically. @Robert Chartier -- we will be creating some central settings (12-hour vs. 24-hour, date format, F vs. C, etc.) With the first preview release our goal is to solicit feedback to determine the most common requirements--and then we'll release regular updates until the release candidate and official SDK release this autumn. We don't expect you to have to change a lot of code between preview and release...but we will be making lots of enhancements over the next few months based on developer feedback. @Robert Chartier -- from Chris -- lunar style -- that's nice! So many watchfaces; it's going to be hard to figure out which one I want to use :) The good news is that all of the watchfaces so far are _tiny_. You could fit more than a hundred of these watchfaces on an AGENT smartwatch and have room to spare. We might need to establish some sort of practical limit, since scrolling through 100 watchfaces may become tiresome :) @John Christman -- from Chris -- very cool. I'm impressed by how many watch faces you're all putting together already! Like Erik, I'm digging the 7-segment font. @Erik Noren -- that's pretty awesome. I love the bouncing/rebounding effects. @Kuek -- when the pushbutton is pressed, leaving the seconds on for 60 seconds is a great idea. We may need to make that a "best practice" :) Thank you! @Ashley Perkins -- you will be able to pick your watchstrap material, size, and color a bit later this year. We will send you an official Kickstarter "survey" and gather your shipping address at the same time. Thank you for your support! @David Mcmillan -- We have both intelligent battery management and intelligent charging. Just set your watch down on the charger whenever it's convenient for you: every week, every night, when your battery is almost dead; whenever is most convenient to you. @lumar -- from Chris -- very cool; a Rorschach-style watchface would be awesome! @Robert Chartier, @sgllama -- we can add sunrise/sunset times to the AGENT SDK, no problem. We'll be sure to support the standard civil times as well as nautical and astronomical. Great feedback; thank you! @Nicolai Kragh-Hansen -- your AGENT smartwatch will need to sit flat on its back for wireless charging. There is a shield on top of the wireless power coil which shields the components above the coil, so charging upside down won't work. Clever idea though :) @Roma - every AGENT smartwatch will come with a limited 2-year warranty. This will cover the replaceable battery under normal usage circumstances. @Dude. -- the watchfaces we have tested so far (binary clock, pixel, orbit) have all been pretty power-efficient, especially when updating once per minute. Once developers have production watches (with built-in power metering), they'll have powerful optimization tools to optionally tune things. @Tae Kim -- the position of your arm shouldn't affect your battery runtime. And yes, your watch will automatically handle Daylight Saving Time :) @Daniel Edwards -- we will publish the first preview developer tools next Thursday. There is documentation for the core .NET Micro Framework runtime today and we will be adding to that core. We will be using some of the Kickstarter funds to pay for a technical writer, to fill out the documentation for this autumn's official SDK release. We will also be incorporating the feedback of developers over the next few months, to refine the SDK and documentation. @Esben -- from Chris -- Your "animated" watch face is pretty cool. Let's chat via PM about code optimization techniques. We can pull together some best practices for developers and start a conversation on the upcoming AGENT forums as well. @O.D. van de Veer -- it's definitely possible to make a watchface with phases of the moon and sunrise/sunset times. We could provide a core API for sunrise/sunset, including nautical and astronomical sunrise/sunset. Would that be useful for watch apps? @Rouven Brandau -- from Chris -- there are three engineers focusing on the core electronics and software plus additional resources working on various aspects of the project. The Kickstarter funds will allow us to move AGENT out of the lab and onto the assembly line, provide customer service and developer support, etc. We've been really blessed to attract super-talented people who are passionate about delivering amazing hardware and great customer experiences. I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention the open-source contributions (big shout-out to David Stetz for his contributions on the SAM4S core). We're very spoiled to work with such cool people. @Minning Xiang -- battery usage for a particular watch app depends primarily on how much processor time that app is using. We will try to provide some basic guidance--and then your watches will give you real-world numbers (since they all have power meters inside them). In the specific case of watchfaces, I would recommend against updating the screen five times per second. Watchfaces run all the time and the wearer usually isn't interacting with them--so it's best to keep things super-low-power so that apps which need extra power have plenty to spare. @Rouven Brandau -- the default emulator may not pick up on DST. We'll address that in the official tools (either in the preview or in a follow-up release soon after). It's obviously important that the time on your watch is correct, and we've built on top of an excellent timekeeping core so that your watch understands both time zones and DST/summer time. @Roma -- from Chris -- No problem, you have our "no bits falling off" guarantee. Check out the rugged Bedlam watches from House or Horology or the Netduino hardware from Secret Labs. Or read the Amazon reviews or listen to Erik or any of the other tens of thousands of Netduino users. It's all high quality gear. We want you to be happy. :) @Erik Noren -- from Chris -- Your orbiting watchface is pretty cool! The use of different sizes of orbiting spheres (similar in concept to hour/minute/second hands) is very clever. I sense that another video is in order :) Thank you for sharing! @Jobm -- we're still on schedule for the preview SDK and preview emulator release next Thursday, and we're on track to start production in November as scheduled. We'll keep you engaged, and will let you know if we run into unexpected delays. All project timelines have some risk involved, but we're super-focused on getting AGENT out the door :) Thank you so much for your support. @Karl Hedlund -- You will need to install Visual Studio 2012. The free Express edition should work great! @Daniel -- from Chris -- great idea. We tried to connect the AGENT Facebook page to the campaign, but it appears that one can only connect a personal Facebook account instead. I wish there was some way to connect the Facebook page directly; perhaps we can link another way. @Chooi -- we can hold onto a few incoming notifications for you. @Dude. -- cool digital watchface. Did you design it for two time zones (home and away)? From Chris -- I just posted some footage of Dylan Mazurek's "Pixel Watchface" :) Photo: <url>"hypermile" techniques will be detailed and explored by developers in the AGENT community. ;) @Tim Chaffee -- the "seconds bar" is a cool concept. Just FYI Skydrive wouldn't let me download source because it "couldn't virus check it." :) @Felipe Martins Paula Leite -- we're hoping to have extra chargers available for order December, but we can't make any promises on that. If not, we can recommend a few third-party options. And of course there's always the January "watch + charger" tier. Sorry about that :( @Dylan Mazurek -- from Chris -- P.S. I shifted your pixels for the "6" to the left one column and then added in the right side of the six. I hope that's okay. Videos may be taken :) @Dylan Mazurek -- from Chris -- your pixel watch face is pretty awesome. I'm going to need to toggle between this and the binary watchface for a while today :) regarding code, try changing SystemMetrics.ScreenWidth to Bitmap.MaxWidth (and the same for Height). They do the same thing, but support for Bitmap.MaxWidth is built into the watch. Quick question: where did you pull the miramob font from? Are you converting fonts using TFConvert (or Miloush's Tiny Font Tool GUI) already? @Fadi Kahhaleh -- you could certainly use the accelerometer to change the watch face (displaying seconds, etc.) That could be catch on. Lots of options. @Shawn Louis Butler Pérez -- from Chris -- thanks for hanging out with us. We're using brand-new technology in AGENT, so it just wasn't possible to bring this advanced of a product to market previously. I'm really looking forward to seeing all the photos and videos of backers wearing their AGENT watches a few months down the road. @Adrian T. -- from Chris -- sorry for teasing you! We'll continue filming videos, of both your apps and ours, not sure if that helps or just teases you more ;) We've started conceptual work on the "app menu" as well (activated by the bottom-left button); you'll be involved as we finalize some of the interim screens which didn't exist on the prototype watches and which we're designing now for your production watches. We'll also be asking for your feedback, involving you in the process and together making AGENT's user experience even more amazing. This will be a fun few months. :) @Esben -- from Chris -- It stopped raining temporarily, so I just took a quick photo and video of your "binary clock" watchface. I just posted them on Facebook. Photo: <url>"update every minute" and "update every second" modes, enabling them to decide whether they want longer battery life or more animations. Animating a watchface briefly every minute may be a good middle-ground for you too. @Evan Hendra -- we are using glass for the lens rather than plastic because glass is beautiful and a lot more scratch resistant. We are evaluating a number of watch glasses and chemically-hardened glasses, but we won't know which one performs best until we order production case molds and do RF transmissivity testing with production cases and various glasses a bit later this year. @Dino -- QR codes on the screen would be awesome. It sounds like a few developers will be tinkering with that :) @Claes Olesen Christensen -- You can download apps directly to the watch. AGENT is a low-power device, so no music stored on the watch itself. It can control the music on your smartphone however. @Esben -- from Chris -- cool binary watchface. I've loaded it up, and will shoot some photos/video in just a bit :) I'm putting together a 3D accelerometer demo; is that something you'd like to see too? @Steve Bulgin -- thank you :) I'd love to film videos of a few user-created watchfaces over the next week, show backers a glimpse of what we'll see over the year :) For developers -- just FYI you can use the TFConvert tool from .NET Micro Framework to convert OpenType and TrueType fonts into our bitmap format--and then include those in your watchfaces and apps. @Fadi Kahhaleh -- yes, absolutely. The templates are there to make it easy to build apps. But you have a larger canvas and you can create apps from scratch if desired. Apps can be side-loaded onto every watch. You have the freedom to create and share. EDIT: that should be "their own watchfaces" :) Developers: if you have installed Visual Studio Express 2012 and the .NET Micro Framework SDK 4.3 already (linked on the agentwatches.com homepage), you can run this sample code in the default NETMF emulator and tinker from there. There are no fonts embedded in this particular sample, but we can show you how to do that now as well if you want a head start. For developers who would like to tinker with creating their won watchfaces before the preview SDK is posted on 20-June-2013, here is preview source for the "Big Digits" watchface: <url>"simple line clock" watchface on one of the prototype watches this evening. Here's a quick video clip I shot just before sunset. Pretty fun; thanks for sharing. :) <url>"Simple Line Clock" watchface by @Esben Photo: <url>"simple line clock" :) Very cool! I took a photo of your first analog watchface on a prototype (ARM7-powered) watch and also filmed a quick video of it running on one of our dual-processor devboards. I removed the white border rectangle for the prototype watch since that run under the slightly-rounded corners--but it adds a nice effect on the devboard so I left it there ;) Uploading them now. I will post in a few moments once they're live. I did make three tweaks to your app, to make it run as an AGENT app: 1. I removed the GPIO Button Handler C# class. 2. I removed the TinyCore assembly and set your screenWidth and screenHeight variables equal to agentScreen (since SystemMetrics is part of the removed TinyCore assembly). 3. I removed the inheritance from "Microsoft.SPOT.Application" for your Program class. The templates in the preview SDK will set all of this up for developers automatically. Would you gentlemen and ladies like to make some more watchfaces, and I'll take more photos and videos? @Esben -- very cool! First third-party AGENT watchface--and we haven't even published the SDK yet :) I just loaded up your watchface on actual AGENT hardware. Want me to take a quick video/snapshot? :) @Karl Hedlund -- yes, for sure, apps can open and close Bluetooth connections. AGENT has one foreground app running at any time (or a watch face). Smartphone apps will also be able to launch their companion app on the watch (for running apps, etc.). We are also working on a background task feature for apps that need threads to run in the background for a few moments periodically. A scheduler which changes the foreground app on the fly could be disconcerting to users. But periodic background tasks--we can make that happen. Would that work well for your app idea? By the way your phone typically has accurate time, and we will enable an option to auto-sync with that clock as well. We do understand that some backers will be using their watches without a smartphone, and we fully support that scenario too. @Roma -- from Chris -- thank you for the sage advice. Whether you pledged $1 or pledged at a watch reward tier, we are grateful for your support. We are here to engage our backers throughout the year as we move AGENT out of the lab and onto the assembly line; we're looking forward to doing great things together. @Andrew -- we're looking into options for "Kickstarter-edition" engraving, limited edition signature cards, etc. It would be easy (and possibly somewhat cheap looking) to silkscreen on some extra print--but we prefer beautiful and classy. Working on it. @Swisscrow -- as Fadi mentioned, we are using watch-grade glass on the prototypes which is both beautiful and also much more scratch resistant than plastic lenses, etc. We are also evaluating other types of chemically-hardened glasses and transparent glass-like watch lens materials such as aluminum oxide (sapphire), to determine if watch-grade versions of these materials are 2.4GHz transmissive. [On a side note, some of these materials come in super-thin sheet thicknesses optimized for touchscreens not optimized for pressure-resistant water seals.] @Mirco Klein -- periodic background agent threads on Windows Phone 8 can download data from the Internet, but they cannot yet create a Bluetooth network connection for access using the Proximity classes. Apps which are running "behind the lock screen" and background apps which feed GPS and other data do have additional network/Proximity capabilities. As Windows Phone continues to gain additional features from WinRT (such as potential raw notification support, Bluetooth LE support, etc.) we will be adding support for these as well :) @carlos frayre -- thank you for your support! AGENT has Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy support. It can read heart rate data from a Bluetooth sensor like the heart rate monitor chest strap that our female runner is wearing in the video. It can also pull GPS data from a companion app on your smartphone, could talk to the new generation of Bluetooth door locks, etc. We have looked at integrating pulse-monitoring functionality into the watch itself--but that sort of functionality would require a special band construction which starts to move us out of the watch realm and into the specialized fitness device realm. With Bluetooth Low Energy support, we can get a lot of the best of all worlds in one watch :) @Plug Komkrit Saksriyuttana -- we looked at adding NFC to the watch, but NFC is an odd thing for a watch. We could have put it at the back next to your wrist, but that could have potentially compromised the Qi coil (since we'd need a double coil). And at the back of your watch it might not be near enough to register easily with other near-field devices. We also thought about putting it right behind the display--but there are concerns there about reliability. In either case--it would have also added about $50 to the sales price of the watch. We're watching NFC technology, for potential inclusion in a watch down the road--but today it would have compromised the quality and overall goals of the device. Regarding music control: there's no technical reason why you couldn't listen to your music on a Bluetooth headset and control that music from your AGENT smartwatch. We don't have a Nokia BH-940 headset here to test, but unless your Bluetooth headset and phone have an exclusive relationship which prohibits third-party AVRCP remotes you should be good to go. @Al_Fonce -- as @Jeroen noted, you could use your watch to display barcodes--but it's up to the scanner as to whether or not it can read codes through glass. This is similar to using a smartphone screen for airport and train check-in; the scanners used by airlines and trains are usually optical instead of laser so that they can read the bar codes successfully. @Kueh -- we're using screws to attach the caseback; a gasket will complete the seal to achieve water resistance. @Chad Bentz -- we don't want to pre-announce any smartphone apps on behalf of app developers, or otherwise steal their glory. :) Lots of work going on behind the scenes to support some popular smartphone app developers, design an IFTTT channel and more. We're pretty excited. @Chad Bentz -- we love Pete Brown. He builds awesome things with Netduinos too. That man has style :) @Pete Brown -- he may be opening up a whole new market for watches! @.-/DoMiNiC\-.-- from Chris -- that's a great idea. On Facebook? @Bernard Hunt -- from Chris -- not sure how to comment on that one ;) Thanks for dropping by the shop and introducing yourself! @Hafeez Hussain -- as @Chucky mentioned...could be cool for a watch down the road. Hopefully display technology and sensors will continue moving towards 1.8V as well, letting us efficiently use that battery technology (which produces half the voltage of traditional Lithium-Ions). @Karl Hedlund -- great question, and you've surmised the answer already :) GPS chips take a lot of power and would drain the battery quickly. Conveniently most of us already have a GPS (or aGPS) receiver in our pockets courtesy of our smartphones--so we can pull the GPS data from phone to watch using Bluetooth. That's one of the cool things about having both Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy inside AGENT: we can connect to a lot of sensors. And then watch apps can parse and display that data. @Vincent L, @Steve Bulgin -- thank you for your enthusiasm :) @Ryan Sweet -- thank you! We are likewise excited to be able to involve our backers over the next few months via photos and videos and test results. It makes us really happy that you are already looking forward to being involved. We have such cool backers :) @Michael Garlick -- we're still working out the details for background agents. We need to unify the notification mechanism and allocate a special heap for managed objects created by your code. Our dream goal is to enable you a lot of flexibility here; we just need to make sure we balance the user's experience, privacy, and security. With the preview SDK you'll be starting out with foreground apps that talk directly to smartphone apps via Bluetooth SPP, and we'll use your feedback to refine and expose advanced features like background agents as we move towards this fall's official SDK release. @CK -- from Chris -- one interesting technical fact on WiFi chip sleep ratings. When we say "sleep mode" we mean that the app isn't doing anything, the processor is still powered on with RAM saved, and we are listening for connections. For some WiFi chips (including that one, from what the datasheet appears to be saying), "sleep" can mean that the chip is powered down and is not attached to an Access Point and is not listening for connections. When those chips are operated in the analogous mode to our "sleep" mode, the power consumption from WiFi alone can be more than five times that of the entire smartwatch :) WiFi chipsets are improving every day. Lots to look forward to from that technology in the future. @Srihari Paulsamy -- the notification mechanisms vary from phone OS to phone OS, but we're working on standardizing them as far as your watch app is concerned. We're also working on standardizing them for the notification source--courtesy of some cool cloud services. More on that one as we firm up details. You will be able to install apps via the companion app. At $1mm in funding, we'll also be able to open up an app store (including at least some paid app options in addition to free watch apps). BTW you will _not_ have to publish an app to an app store to be able to install it on watches. All apps can be side-loaded--so third party app stores and in-app phone purchases are options too. @Erik, @Dude. -- we'll make sure the packaging doesn't look or feel like a boring cardboard box ;) Packaging is an art in balance; we'll share snapshots as we work through the design. We want you to smile while opening up the box. @Patrick Brown -- thank you for helping answer questions. You're awesome. @Alper Torun -- we continually evaluate the best WiFi technologies; we'll definitely look at it again down the road :) A backer map would be awesome! Right now we only have locations for some of our backers (i.e. those who list their location publicly). For the remaining backers (i.e. probably most backers) we'll need to wait until we send out surveys later this year and ask for shipping addresses. @Wayne Daniells -- Bluetooth headsets do take a bit of extra power on your phone, and AGENT should be similar. That said, your smartwatch will use Bluetooth Low Energy with iPhone for watch-to-app communications--so that will help preserve battery life further. @kani -- Right now, AGENT is set up to communicate with an Internet-enabled app on your smartphone (which has WiFi or a data plan). It may be possible to tweak the software to pull from two sources in the future--since we can support two incoming Bluetooth instances at the same time--but for now you'll want to use your smartwatch directly with a smartphone for Internet-connected apps. @Dude. -- agreed, premium packaging adds a lot to a product. For AGENT, we also want something that looks and feels premium to match the watch cradled inside--while also remaining compact enough for affordable international shipping. We'll be sure to share some behind the scenes info and photos as we prepare the packaging over the next few months. @CK -- great question. We will have extra chargers available around the time that AGENT smartwatch rewards start shipping to backers. You'll also be able to use other Qi-compliant chargers. Thanks to everyone who stopped by World Science Festival to check out AGENT gear, including this aspiring young Agent (video from House of Horology): <url>"favorite contacts" idea later. We don't want the UI to go too deep and get confusing, but I do love the idea. @Rob D -- that's a very good idea. The actual temperature and the perceived (with wind/heat index) temperature can be very different indeed. We'll see what we can do! @Michael Garlick -- typically you'll have one "foreground" app running at a time, and we'll hibernate that app whenever the user switches tasks. We are working on some options for background operations (to process background data received by notification, for instance). We'll provide some sort of intra-app communication for that. You can also bundle a watchface with your watch app which basically became it's UI when the app was "running in the background." @Tim Chaffee -- from Chris -- :) AGENT's hardware isn't optimized to record or playback music or to process voice commands, so you'd need to process voice data in the cloud. Which I would recommend doing by speaking into an app that resides on your smartphone and then using AGENT as a wrist-based display. From Chris -- I really like the "favorite contacts dialer" idea too. Let's circle back to that a bit later, and see what APIs we can expose for app developers to list and dial phone contacts. We may have to limit it to the phone's address book entries, to prevent rogue watch apps from dialing pay-per-minute phone numbers ;) @Mirco Klein -- Your AGENT smartwatch will support the Bluetooth Phone Book profile so yes an app could be written to dial your phone. I'm not sure how awesome that would be on a small screen--but possible :) You can also start music playback on your Lumia from your smartwatch. It may also be possible to start music playing and have the phone direct that music to your car's Bluetooth-enabled speakers, but we would have to do some testing on that to make sure. @Tim -- from Chris -- I sense that there may be an app for that :) @Cesar Del Pino -- the glass question is largely an engineering question. We haven't been able to find anyone who has tried to put sapphire over an antenna before. There are concerns about its RF transmissivity in the 2.4GHz spectrum. We have engineers working on it :) Needless to say, we're striving to use the extra funds to make your premium smartwatches even nicer. P.S. We're are publicly committing to post official updates at least twice a month leading up to ship day after the campaign--and more regularly when there's lots to talk about. We're on Kickstarter to build something amazing with our backers; we won't abandon you :) @Michael Garlick -- based on developer feedback, we are going to enable the smartphone to launch apps on the watch. We need to work out some user protections around this...but you will be able to do that via Bluetooth commands or specially-formed notifications. Speaking of which--you'll also be able to send text notifications to the watch (with embedded 1-bit images if you'd like). Aggressive geofencing? Sounds like adventure :) @kani -- from Chris -- sorry, no multi-packs. But if you want to message me, I can at least get you on the priority list for pre-orders, for after we've finished shipping AGENT watch rewards to all of our backers. Thank you for your enthusiasm! @Fadi Kahhaleh -- you have PM :) @N.H. -- from Chris -- thank you for your kind note. And very true! I was intending to say that Sapphire is pretty standard on $500+ watches--rather than it couldn't exist on $100 watches. Watch-grade sapphire is pretty expensive stuff, so it can easily make up a third of the cost of a $100 watch. :) @Fadi Kahhaleh -- P.S. for reference, our default digital watchface (big numbers) is 8KB including graphics. @Fadi Kahhaleh -- our SAM4S micro has 2MB of flash. Average watch apps will be around 32KB (since MSIL is compact and the runtime is already in flash). Bitmaps are 1-bit graphics so they are tiny. You should be able to run up to about 50 apps. Apps will be able to request data storage in flash too. @Joakim Lindfors -- good question. The pushers (buttons) on the watch are custom but similar to the layered pushers used on House of Horology's Bedlam watches. They are designed to be comfortable and long-lasting. There is no click, but that's on purpose: we don't want your watch to feel and sound like a mouse. Like a modern smartphone, the animated user interface provides the wearer with instant feedback on button press. @Rob D -- we've been talking to sapphire lens manufacturers, but none of them have been able to confirm that sapphire (aluminum oxide) has RF transmissivity at 2.4GHz. Sapphire is also super-expensive which is why they're generally found on $500+ watches. We're actively investigating it though :) In any case, the watch glass we use will be beautiful and much more scratch resistant than plastic lenses. @Fadi Kahhaleh -- we looked at WiFi, but the standby mode current of ultra-low-power WiFi chips would reduce our battery life to just 2-3 days. And while we could create a power-user mode which powered up WiFi that means it would only be usable by a small number of applications for short periods of time. And you'd have to enter the WiFi passcode for every new network you came across, presumably via a Bluetooth-connected smartphone with an onscreen keyboard. Overall, not a very pleasant user experience. Smartphones generally have a constant connection to the Internet which we can leverage to provide consistent data access on our wrists. Power consumption of new WiFi chipsets will continue to drop further, and we have a full TCP stack available which we can plug straight into AGENT OS. Over time we can look at providing even more ways to connect your smartwatch to your data. @François -- no worries. You don't need to pick your watchstrap size until later when we send out the survey. We'll also provide you with a printable "online ruler" to help you pick the strap that's perfect for you. :) @Wayne Daniells -- noted, thank you. We're looking at an option for a shorter leather strap (in one or two accent colors). We'll post an official update once we know we can budget these in for certain; right now we're 80% sure we can do it :) @Vincent L -- there's no altimeter in AGENT, but we do have a Z-axis (up/down movements) on the accelerometer. So you could detect some upward and downward movement. Calculate in the rate of gravity and you could probably do some rough approximations--but again a real altimeter is probably better for those types of scenarios. Especially since the wearer's arm won't be perfectly level so you'd be getting this data on several axes making things a bit more complicated. For skydiving, you might be able to pull better data since the wrist would be more stationary. The math in this could get tricky, and it would still be rough math, but testing the app would make for a fun excuse to go jump out an airplane :) @Semyon Maryasin -- you'd need an app for your watch and tablet to enable music control in that scenario, but yes the AGENT hardware is capable of that :) @Maxime Marical -- we will have the preview emulator and preview SDK ready for launch when the campaign concludes. We're also working on setting up online forums so we can get provide direct support for developers, although that may follow by a few days. In the meantime, we are writing apps live at events using an early version of the preview SDK (and are showing off some samples over on Facebook too). And a lot of the SDK is the .NET Micro Framework class libraries themselves. If you give us an idea of what you're looking to build, we can point you to some documentation already :) @Karl Hedlund -- you could certainly use the 3D accelerometer for that. You can use the Bluetooth Serial Port profile to communicate with that PC-based service. Lots of cool game-type applications too. The accelerometer itself doesn't take much power; your app and Bluetooth would take the majority of power in that scenario. If you get a Bluetooth Low Energy dongle for your PC, with a little extra elbow grease I bet we could drive down the Bluetooth power too :) @Andre Koschyk -- iPod Touch will technically work, as long as you have one of the newer ones with Bluetooth Low Energy support. We're "officially" supporting iPhone since we know that some apps will want GPS data from the phone--but you can still get some nice functionality on your iPod Touch "unofficially" :) @Wayne Daniells -- AGENT supports two slave connections. Normally we use these for a connection to your smartphone and an optional connection to your PC (for Visual Studio support) but there's no reason why you couldn't use the second connection to talk to your tablet computer instead. Do you have a particular usage scenario in mind? @Stefan Thoolen -- correct. @Erik Noren -- we use Bluetooth SPP to deploy and debug apps to your AGENT smartwatch. So generally speaking if you have Bluetooth 2.x or newer on your PC you should be good to go in that department. @Kueh -- as long as your smartphone supports active pairing to two HFP devices at the same time (such as your car and Bluetooth headset using HFP), you're good to go. We will be testing a number of scenarios around this to provide you with the most options and best integration experience. From Chris -- it's awesome that we have customs experts as backers. We ship to the EU today, but usually as bulk shipments to our Netduino resellers. Your offers of assistance to make sure that we line everything up properly for lots of small shipments is greatly appreciated. We will be reaching out; thank you! @O.D. van de Veer -- smaller wrist, noted, thank you. @Brenda Boda Klenke -- noted, thank you. @Niklas Krebs, @Daniel -- thank you for the feedback on shorter watchstraps. Much appreciated! @Steve Bulgin -- from Chris -- we will provide a printable "online ruler" along with the survey for your watchstrap size. Is "smaller wrists" a more politically-sensitive term? @Paul -- the Qi charger's current limits are a factor of the charger itself, not necessarily the power source. We can guarantee support for 500mA with the charger and may be able to support 1A -- but 2A is going to be out of our charger's range. @Fadi Kahhaleh -- if you install Visual Studio 2012 and the .NET Micro Framework SDK 4.3, you'll be prepared :) Both downloads are direct-linked from: <url>"Bluetooth 4.0 BD/EDR + LE" or "Bluetooth Smart Ready" seems the best way to say that it's backwards compatible as well as low-energy capable. In summary: no worries, you're covered :) @CK -- we evaluated the e-ink displays, but they don't allow for animations. We wanted a fluid user interface. The Sharp Memory Display gives us both the low-power benefits of e-paper and the high frame rates of LCDs. @Peter Vogel -- sure, it's definitely possible to capture accelerometer data (twist of wrist, etc.) on the watch and send that data to your smartphone, to cause some action on the smartphone. Or you could even directly play/pause music using Bluetooth AV control. What kind of action are you thinking of, for the smartphone? @Boudewijn ten Boom -- from Chris -- about your profile photo...have you ever seen these? <url>"test" them a while back :) @Boudewijn ten Boom -- thanks for your support! You are welcome to drop by the House of Horology shop in SoHo anytime that you're in New York. We will also be hosting a few events in NYC this year; we hope we get to meet even more of our backers in person, showing you the latest progress as we move AGENT towards the assembly line. @Christopher Burnett -- from Chris -- actually, a deployable force field would be nice. If a force field kept out water, it would make the watch much less expensive to manufacture. Teleporter is dangerous though; we'd have to make sure it was compatible with all lengths of watchstraps. We like thinking outside of the box to find creative solutions to problems--but I have to admit that we hadn't thought about the force field idea. There's always the next-next-next-generation watch in 2019 to handle that I suppose. :) @Tae Kim -- yes, we will provide a manual showing how to operate the features of your AGENT smartwatch. :) @Roma -- yes, for the most functionality with iOS you will need iPhone 4S or newer. Smartphone-to-smartwatch app communication happens on iPhone using Bluetooth LE which is a new feature on iPhone 4S and 5. Your AGENT smartwatch will use AVRCP for control of iPhone's music, just like cars do. If your car or phone cannot share that connection, we can provide a way for you to disable that feature on your watch. There are also alternative ways to control music on some smartphone platforms, so lots of options there. @Thomas Trutch -- great question. Since AGENT has two-way Bluetooth communications to your phone, and since your phone has GPS capabilities--yes, you could certainly have an app which feeds real-time map data or directions to the watch. I anticipate that a few developers have already starting thinking about this :) @Bram Ueffing -- no microphone for the current watch, but we can look at that down the road for next-generation offerings. We have huge worries about water and microphones--but we are also engineers who like a good challenge :) @paopao -- we've allocated some RAM inside AGENT to cache multiple notifications. If you get a few notifications before dismissing the first one, you'll be able to dismiss each of them in order. RIght now our prototypes only support one notification at a time--but we understand that stacked notifications are important so we've figured out the technical end of it and now we're working out the best way to support this in the UI. @Maxime Marical -- we built the AGENT prototypes to prove out and demonstrate the most basic features of production AGENT smartwatches. The prototypes themselves implement the features demonstrated in the video using prototype parts--and by nature are not finished products themselves. Your production smartwatch will use our next-gen electronics design (i.e. the same one we've been demonstrating on our gorgeous black validation boards) and will have additional pretty UI elements and extra features; those will tie together all of the existing features we've demonstrated into a premium user experience. For technology projects, Kickstarter is all about sharing an idea and working prototypes--and then rallying people together so that it's possible to ship production hardware which realizes that vision. We do invite you to join us on that journey--but we also understand if you want to only back projects which are ready for store shelves today. We want you and all of our backers to be happy backers, and you can always buy a watch at full MSRP next year, a few months after other backers strap on their rewards. Either way, we are confident that you'll have a good experience with AGENT. We're here to do something great together. @Bram Ueffing -- we actually looked at adding in a microphone and speaker, letting your watch work as a Bluetooth speakerphone and controller for Siri. What we found is that the uncomfortable arm position and the poor quality of super-tiny speakers resulted in the world's worst speakerphone experience :) Plus...waterproofing issues. Chris @Esben -- you have PM :) @Tim Chaffee -- yes, your AGENT smartwatch is capable of sending data to and from your smartphone via Bluetooth. If you had an app running on your smartphone capable of playing sound through your smartphone speaker then you can certainly use that speaker as an extension of your smartwatch app. @Bram Ueffing -- from Chris -- thank you :) Part of our responsibility in delivering a great product is to limit scope and do the most important things really well. I know we'd get even more backers if we just said "yes" to adding a lot of extra features and changing the hardware design--but that path is not one we're willing to take since it would ultimately disappoint both us and our backers. And with the rich SDK, a lot of those extra features will be created and shared by our superb community of developers. That's the awesome thing about an open app ecosystem. For background services, we're thinking mostly of getting data from the phone in real-time and making simple decisions on how to notify the user. It's really important to us that foreground applications are not adversely affected by background processes and that background processes don't drain battery life. So we'll start with some simple background options and then we'll add more based on developer feedback. This is very similar to how Windows Phone's background tasks have evolved. @Maxime Marical, @Kueh -- some happy news there: since we met our funding goal early, we've been working on some extra power-features regarding caller ID and notifications. We'll take some quick videos of those on either the prototypes or on the validation boards over the next two weeks--and share them on our Facebook page. <url>"borrow" hers. :) @Paul Shabian -- $800K and 4,400+ backers is really incredible, and we're so grateful. We are working on a number of things with the additional funds, mostly developer related so that we can help make sure you can have cool apps for your watch. But we are also working on one or two non-developer enhancements. We'll have some commitments a bit later this week--and as pledges continue to grow we'll be able to commit to doing more with those additional funds too. Thank you all so much for your support. @Srihari Paulsamy -- thanks for dropping by at World Science Festival. It was great to meet you and chat with you in person. And of course to build a "hello world" feature on the fly :) BTW--the watch app actually stores all the icons locally and renders the screen on the watch itself. You could do that from the phone, but we expect that most connected watch apps will simply receive data from the smartphone and then process and render that information locally on the watch itself. We're also going to be providing some background options for watch apps to receive data when they're not running as the foreground app. We're working through the details--but that is an important scenario to us as well. We like seamless experiences. @David Cole -- good point! The "Lost Phone Link" alert is there to let you know that you've left your phone behind. You will be able to dismiss that by pressing any of the buttons except for the backlight button. And if you don't want that feature at all, we can give you a way to turn it off. @Dylan Mazurek -- we actually looked into tiny speakers, but the tinny sound and lackluster experience they'd give just didn't match a premium product like AGENT. The vibration motor should be a really good notification system, and a lot less annoying for our work colleagues. :) @Maxime Marical -- we will be launching online forums for AGENT shortly after the 30-day campaign concludes. We'll be providing pointers on how to code apps, sharing apps with each other, etc. There are going to be a lot of technical conversations, so we'll probably see the Kickstarter comments being heavier on capabilities and features...and the forums being more focused on app development. @Bram Ueffing -- from Chris -- we are taking steps to ensure we can offer good customer service to our backers. If you have a bad customer service experience, please message me directly and we'll take steps to remedy that for you. @Kueh -- from Chris -- you have PM :) @NY -- from Chris -- we'll absolutely make sure to keep you updated throughout the "road to your wrist" process. One of the reasons we're here on Kickstarter is because we want to involve our backers in the actual process of bringing a product to market. And while we're past the long invention process, designing the core circuitry, etc.--there is still a lot to share. We will remain engaged with our backers, responding to comments here and communicating about app development through threads on the AGENT forums (which will be launching soon after the 30 day campaign ends). We will be updating all of our backers via a Kickstarter update at least twice a month--and more than that during busy periods when there is a lot to share. We're here for you. We do need to make sure we focus on getting watches onto the assembly line and out to backers--so I can't promise responses within the hour--but we won't abandon you. You have my commitment on that. Chris @Kevin Duke -- thanks for the feedback! With the extra funds, we'll be able to create extra tutorials--which means cool sample apps. We're also releasing a preview SDK and emulator in just 17 days and holding at least one hackathon--so we'll definitely have some cool apps at launch :) @David Cole -- yes, of course. AGENT is an amazing watch first and foremost. It can display time for up to a month on a charge: no cellphone connection required for that. @John Melo -- from Chris -- you can get the leather straps wet. If you're going to immerse your watch in water frequently, the silicon rubber straps might be the better pick. I wear a leather strap with my prototype watch without worries. @Erik Noren -- great photos! Thanks for coming out to the event to check out AGENT, and thank you for sharing your experience with us online! @Kueh -- it would be great to discuss a "do not disturb" feature as a community, to help ensure we implement it in a way that is useful to everyone. Some community members may want calls to vibrate through to their wrist but no other notifications, for instance. We can enable a few options. @Chucky -- yes, the leather watchstraps with thick stitching are pretty awesome. The silicon rubber straps are high quality too; in the end we're glad to be able to offer both durable materials. @Leo Lü -- we will be licensing Simplified Chinese fonts for AGENT as well. :) @Adam Meadows -- a nighttime "do not disturb" mode is a great idea. We could support that in software. @Omid Mirshafiei -- just FYI: backer Brandon Vladimir Hernandez took photos at World Science Festival, including a photo with leather and prototype silicon rubber straps side by side. Leather in bottom-left corner of photo; silicon rubber just to the right of those: <url>"Bedlam Dark Brown"). Not sure how well brown would match the black-background display, but if there are a few requests for Dark Brown we can see if it is possible to outfit a few backers' watches with those straps on request. <url>"thanks for posting and pointing out that comment in the updates thread." @Brandon Vladimir Hernandez -- from Chris -- Thank you so much for heading out to World Science Festival yesterday to meet us! You had so many great questions and it was a lot of fun to answer them and demo all our gear for you. Your enthusiasm is contagious :) @Steve Bulgin -- thanks for posting out that comment in the updates threads. I'll be sure to reply there too. @Aaron Morris -- yes :) We're really close to our next big pledge milestone, enabling some new benefits for both developers and end users. Our amazing backers are backing so quickly...we're busy working to leverage those extra funds to deliver even more cool extras. Thank you for your support! @Steve Bulgin -- the Xamarin/Mono tools are very cool, indeed. Thanks for mentioning that and providing a link. @Dylan Mazurek - yes, for sure! We will be sure to take lots of quick snapshots and videos of the "road to your wrist" process. Let us know what kinds of things you'd like to see. We can't take photos of everything--but we really want to include our backers in the process. @Paige Dula, @TDK, @Dylan Mazurek -- thank you for the compliments and for your support! @Omid Mirshafiei -- from Chris -- Lawrence has a few of the silicon rubber watchstraps on his drawing table at 2:24 in the main project video; they are designed to match the genuine leather straps :) The prototype straps were a popularly-photographed item yesterday at World Science Festival. We will also do a side-by-side photo comparison of both the leather and silicon rubber options, attached to AGENT watches, once we get the production straps a bit later this year. @Luke Venables -- from Chris -- I like the sound of that. Thank you, Agent. :) @Andreas B.Hansen -- definitely. We will have a community at agentwatches.com shortly after the preview SDK ships. @John Melo -- from Chris -- submarine? Might be hard to deliver your watch :) We will make it work. I just sent you a follow-up message. @John Melo -- you have e-mail :) We'll take care of you, no worries. @paopao -- from Chris -- I have a feeling that a lot of children may start borrowing your watch, just to play with the "hot or cold" app :) It would be a lot of fun to hide things. @Ovsep Ambartsumyan -- we've been evaluating Sapphire, actually. Yes it's very expensive. We also haven't been able to confirm that it's RF passive for 2.4 GHz signals. And yes, glass is a lot more scratch resistant than plastic; our prototypes are still scratch-free after I've worn them--and that's saying a lot :) @Qadiym Stewart -- that's a pretty sweet idea. A replaceable watchstrap that was also a battery? Pretty cool! @Andy Soetedja -- we will be making extra straps, and will have them available when smartwatches start rolling off the assembly line. @paopao -- if you ever misplace your phone around the house...you can use the music control app on your smartwatch to find your phone. :) An app developer could also take advantage of the Bluetooth LE Proximity profile to create a "hot or cold: how close are you to your phone" app too. :) @Dude. -- yes, for sure. That kind of animation every second keeps things interesting for users without unnecessarily draining the battery. You'll have precise current measurements when you write and optimize your apps, so you'll know up front how battery-efficient it is. @John Christman -- our official smartphone companion apps will be free downloads from the official app stores, but we know that there is a community of users with jailbroken phones too. One of the popular app makers for jailbroken phones has reached out to ask, desiring to support AGENT. We cannot speak for them or their feature sets but you may be able to get even more functionality if you go the jailbreak route. @Luke Venables -- yes, absolutely! We love developers. We'll be sharing tutorials and videos and sample code all year long. @Clev Wong -- it appears that you're super-fast too. :) @Chucky -- you're so fast :) We just added an update to the main page describing the extra-long strap option. Great recommendation, thank you. @Richard Keast -- from Chris -- sure! We can help you hook up a Sharp Memory Display to your Netduino 2. That's more of a "cool things to do with my Netduino" project than a "let's build a smartwatch together" conversation, so let's start a thread over on the Netduino forums. That will also help avoid making the comments here rather confusing to non-engineers. ;) To get started, I recommend picking up the following: Molex 51441-1093 (FPC connector) FPC to DIP adapter (we usually buy these from www.proto-advantage.com, one of our Netduino resellers) Sharp LS013B7DH03 (Mouser carries these in stock) A few capacitors and some wires (see the LS013B7DH03's datasheet for specifics) We built our early AGENT prototypes using full-sized Netduinos, so this is feeling oddly familiar all of a sudden :) @Srihari Paulsamy -- noon to 8pm tomorrow in Brooklyn. We're writing up an official update now. We'd love to meet you there! @Adam Meadows -- for iPhone we need Bluetooth Low Energy to support smartphone app to smartwatch app communication. That's an Apple App Store policy. iPhone 4S is the first iPhone to support Bluetooth Low Energy, so you'll need an iPhone 4S or newer. On iPhone, it's an iOS policy restriction rather than a technology restriction. For Android and Windows Phone 8, we can support Bluetooth Classic mode. @Peter Karman -- Good news: you don't need Bluetooth 4.0 on your smartphone to support AGENT. Our Bluetooth 4.0 radio is dual-mode, so it supports Bluetooth Classic as well as Bluetooth Low Energy. We're backwards-compatible with the older versions of Bluetooth! @Richard Keast -- are you looking to draw full frames or do you need the Bitmap drawing primitives? Netduino doesn't include the necessary native code for the latter; we had to create special firmware for Netduino Mini and a managed code Bitmap.Flush() routine for the prototypes. If you have a Netduino Mini, we could definitely share some firmware/code with you. It's not something that we can officially support--and it will be painfully slow compared to the optimized native implementation we wrote for our ARM Cortex-M4 processor (as seen in the latest Facebook video)--but we're here to help you unleash your creativity :) @Niklas Krebs -- from Chris -- the prototype watches are around 70 grams, made from lightweight aluminum. The production cases won't be super-lightweight or unreasonably heavy for a watch. We'll share precise weights once we finish wireless testing on the production case samples. Even more photos? We can make that happen! They may need to be cameraphone pictures though, snapshots of what we're working on. I'll also be wearing a prototype watch this weekend--so I'm sure there will be a few photos shot by backers too :) @Hilmi Shah -- if you'd like one of House of Horology's Bedlam analog watches, those are already in production and available for sale ;) They are super cool looking, for sure, which is why AGENT was inspired by Bedlam DNA. @Иван Зуб -- Firmware updates will be downloaded to your watch from a companion smartphone app (using Bluetooth). @Kevin Duke -- that's a feature which has been requested a few times. If we can support "find my phone" via a software update, we will. @Lex Nguyen -- sorry, we don't have multi-pack reward tiers. We're here on Kickstarter to bring an awesome smartwatch to market together, and we're trying to avoid the feeling that Kickstarter is a store. AGENT does have a real glass lens which offers superior scratch resistance over plastic lenses. It's also high-clarity so the screen looks great. @Dan Mitchell -- our backers have been very generous, backing our project with the required funds--plus additional funds which enable us to make AGENT even better. We have also taken a number of precautions to make sure that early backers benefit from the extra funding. We've have also been careful to avoid scope creep. And we have limited monthly production numbers to ensure product quality. We will scale production over time, but we would rather have 5,000 happy backers than lots more unhappy backers :) @Adam Meadows -- Kickstarter does provide us with a backer # for each backer. I'm not sure if there's an easy way to provide that number to our backers--but if you write down the backer count when you pledge, that should match. To get data from the Internet to the watch, you will need an app on the smartphone which can pull that data. Some backers have started talking about building an HTTP proxy app as well. The watch doesn't use Bluetooth network connection sharing (which backers on data plans with no tether support may come to appreciate). You can measure heart rate using a heart rate monitor chest strap like the Zephyr model that our female runner is wearing in our video. Her monitor uses Bluetooth Classic, but we will be supporting Bluetooth Low Energy monitors as well. @Dude. -- you have technical questions, we have technical answers for you! :) The Bitmap.Flush function has an overload which lets you specify a specific region of your UI that you want to push to the display: <url>"random lines screensaver" app, we're flushing out the whole display. @Matheus Oosthuysen -- if they release documentation and/or an SDK for third party devices to support their locks...there's a good chance :) It seems like a pretty cool Bluetooth LE lock. @Al_Fonce -- multiple Bluetooth Low Energy tethers are possible, although not something we already have in the works. With all the Bluetooth Low Energy fobs popping up, this is definitely something we could look into supporting in a software update. Does this remind anyone of their favorite screensaver? <url>"power toys" to build. Cool idea. I could use that for cabs. "If average GPS speed over last minute is greater than 5mph, leash distance equals five feet." @Andrew Warner -- from Chris -- I just posted the code for the alignment app on Facebook, as a comment to the photo. I'm copying it here, for those interested in the drawing primitives. -- code follows -- public static void Main() { Bitmap bitmap = new Bitmap(128, 128); // clear the screen buffer bitmap.Clear(); // draw an X bitmap.DrawLine(Color.White, 1, 0, 0, 127, 127); bitmap.DrawLine(Color.White, 1, 0, 127, 127, 0); // draw a - bitmap.DrawLine(Color.White, 1, 0, 63, 127, 63); // update the screen bitmap.Flush(); // sleep forever Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite); } @Paul -- that's good feedback. Some users might want a ten foot phone leash :) The range may not be configurable using Bluetooth Classic, but we can work some extra magic for smartphones with Bluetooth Low Energy (using the Proximity profile). @Andrew Warner -- from Chris -- I took a quick photo of the alignment watch app outside, wearing one of the prototypes. I ended up doing an 'X' and a '-'. Pardon the dust; this is a quick photo under outdoor light using my Lumia 920--not a studio photo :) <url>"100 meter" range, but indoors a more realistic number is "up to 30 meters". We'll be testing the lost link alert in different building types (concrete, open air, chicken wire walls), but our ideal goal is about 30 meters. We may be able to make this an adjustable range setting as well. @Dude. -- from Chris -- August 2010. Have we been shipping electronics using .NET Micro Framework for almost three years already? It's been a lot of fun helping all of you build your own custom electronics projects with our Netduino boards; I can't wait to see what you build next! @Alibek Makhmudov -- we will be happy to help support integration with "We Chat". Please contact the developer and have them reach out to us. Thank you! @Andrew Warner -- we just posted the AGENT smartwatch artwork from our emulator on our Facebook page. Both transparent and black background versions, actual pixel size, PNG format. <url>"alternative functions." That's pretty cool. @Wayne Daniells -- as backer funding continues to increase, we'll be able to announce more cool things. We're also going to start digging into the SDK, talking about the technology, and having at least one or two real-world meetings in the next three weeks. Then we'll share inside looks at the actual process of going from lab to assembly line over the coming months. And then...watch on your wrist! Lots to come. :) @Minning Xiang -- we use the latest memory display technology from Sharp. The new generation of memory-in-pixel display technology is more power efficient and more reflective than the earlier displays. The display is also square, with a standard 1:1 aspect ratio, so analog watchfaces look fantastic :) @Kevin Duke -- watchfaces can display seconds, but we recommend that pressing the middle-right buttons toggles them on and off. Fewer frames per second/minute does stretch battery runtime. We'll provide tools for developers to measure the power consumption of watchfaces so they can optimize for battery life. That said, if you want heavy animation you can go for that too. @Andrew Warner -- missed a word. Make that "do more cool things together". Wish we had an edit button :) @Иван Зуб -- we will have a preview (early access) SDK and emulator available on 20-Jun-2013. The preview SDK will enable developers to start working out their watch app and watchface concepts. We'll use the feedback from our backers to finalize the first official SDK, which will ship in advance of the watches. Developers use Visual Studio to develop watch apps (including the free Express version) and draw graphics using the Bitmap drawing primitives. @Andrew Warner -- we love rewards. We're trying to keep things simple and streamlined, but maybe we can more cool things together after December? @Robbe Bresseleers -- the brand-new high resolution memory display we're using in AGENT is actually the best one available today. It's a bit wider than the other display you just mentioned, more reflective, lower power, square (great for analog watch faces), and it has an FPC connector which helps us ensure you don't get garbled text on your screen. :) The memory display is paired with a real glass lens and a custom designed variable-brightness backlight, resulting in a high-clarity display that you can see in any light and with sunglasses on. In summary, yes, that's locked down :) Thank you for asking; these are good questions. @Maxime Marical -- right now we're super focused on getting AGENT out of the lab and onto our backers' wrists; we will make sure you can get extra watches after that. Thank you for your enthusiasm! @Steve Bulgin -- thank you! And we really appreciate you over in the Netduino community too! Magnets and magnetic fields are tricky things. We're going to see what we can do. Normally we wouldn't even talk about features that aren't in the official specifications, but with Kickstarter we want to invite backers in and understand how products are made. Hopefully it's not information overload :) @Jonathon Grigg -- from Chris -- thank you for your determination, overcoming dying phone batteries to post :) We will look into numbering for casebacks. Engraving can be really slow, so I'm not sure that we can promise anything there. But we want our Kickstarter backers to have something special to show the world that they helped make AGENT happen--so we're looking at lots of options. White or black accent stitching will probably look best with your green school uniform. We will be sure to take lots of photos of watches with both materials and all color options. This takes quite a bit of time and we need to do it in a photo studio so you get good color representation, so we'll probably do it shortly after the production silicone watchstraps and first production case samples arrive. You will have plenty of time to stew over strap color and material choices; you won't need to select these until later this year when we order the straps. Thank you for your passion! @Kueh -- just to clarify, Qi receiver coils (watch side) have attractors; Qi transmitter coils (charger side) have magnets. For free-positioning (larger, multi-coil) transmitters no magnets are necessary. If the attractor doesn't interfere with the magnetometer, we may gain a bonus feature down the road. Proper charging is a on our critical feature list, so we've engineered in the attractor for now to make sure that charging is both efficient and hassle-free. @Dude. -- from Chris -- Brooklyn, 12pm until the early evening. We'll post an official update by tomorrow, inviting backers to come talk about and play with tech. We're finalizing the details today. @Andrew Warner -- the preview SDK and preview emulator ship on 20-jun-2013. If you'd like to play with it early and you're in the NYC area, come hang out with us this Saturday :) @Tim Chaffee -- from Chris -- ooh that is a pretty lock :) If they open it up for third-party apps, it would be awesome to have an AGENT app to unlock one's door. @Andrew Warner -- the magnetic attractor on our prototype wireless power receiver coil helps the device "self-center". It's not very strong, and you may not even realize that it's doing its job. We'll be testing the production watches with a number of Qi charging pads. If in our testing the self-centering feature is not useful, we may remove the attractor to enable other features which are built into our chips. We've included the attractor in our prototype coils because we want it to be really easy to charge your watch, not worrying about placing it in the right position on single-coil chargers. Qi charging pads can also offer free-positioning, using multiple coils. In those cases there is nothing to attract the attractor. With every charger our goal is hassle-free charging. Chris @Jonathan, @Kueh -- our 3D accelerometer (rectangular black part on the validation boards to the right of the mode pushbutton, pictured in the "road to your wrist section") is ST LSM303DLHC. <url>"it's probably best to browse the shelves at an electronics store instead." There are benefits to shopping for finished goods at Amazon and Best Buy, and there are benefits to backing projects on Kickstarter. The collaboration and camaraderie here at Kickstarter is a wonderful thing. @Andrew Warner -- thank you for taking the time to dig into AGENT's technology, and for helping out others in the AGENT and Kickstarter communities :) @Pete -- yes, there is a servicing model for the core OS. We can even replace the recovery mode software safely. It all deploys over Bluetooth, and it all has fail-safe protections. To update the core OS, the watch reboots into recovery mode. The recovery mode software erases the current operating system and then downloads the updated operating system via Bluetooth. It writes the new operating system to flash, verifies that it was written correctly, and then reboots. Upon reboot the operating system starts. If the operating system update fails (phone battery dies, solar storms, walk out or range with watch, etc.) you simply restart the update procedure. The recovery mode software will automatically stay in recovery mode until the operating system is flashed correctly. In the rare case than an operating system update ever flashed successfully but cannot boot, you can reboot into recovery mode by pressing and holding the bottom-left, top-right, and middle-right buttons. From there you can erase the OS, revert the watch to factory state, etc. Yes, there are backup-backup procedures :) If you're familiar with Netduino, replace "recovery mode" with "TinyBooter" and "operating system" with "TinyCLR" and "downloads the operating system" with "Deploy ER_FLASH via MFDeploy" in the above description and you'll understand the functional parallels. Since AGENT is totally wireless, we strongly felt that we needed fail-safes. We don't want any chance that a bad firmware update could brick your watch. We can even update the recovery mode software (to support updated Bluetooth profiles), and we have fail-safes in place for that process too. We may have over-engineered AGENT a bit, it's true :) But like with Netduino, we want to build you a great piece of hardware that will be reliable and last you for years. @A Blue -- our prototypes run watch apps, communicate via Bluetooth, and can perform all the features showcased in the video. The gentleman in the first half of our video was wearing an ARM7-powered AGENT prototype watch. Now, because of our awesome Kickstarter backers, we're able to move AGENT out of the lab and onto the assembly line. Over the next few months we'll be creating watchcase molds and production circuit boards, polishing off the software UIs, adding support for Bluetooth LE, getting certifications, and making a large number of next-generation smartwatches for our backers. Sometimes backers accidentally mistake Kickstarter for a store, expecting prototypes to be production off-the-shelf products. If you're looking to buy a finished product--which sounds like it is the case--it's probably to browse the shelves at an electronics store instead. Kickstarter is a great tool for building things together, but it's not a store. @Felicite -- from Chris -- aww, thank you so much! I give our engineers fairly unrealistic requirements sometimes--and somehow they pull through with really great solutions. If all their hard work inspires you or makes you happy in some way...it's all worth it. Thank you for backing our project; we're all super-excited too :) @Professor Snake -- from Chris -- awesome name :) The fashion-forward watchcase is already designed, although we may make small tweaks for fit and finish. There's a lot of amazing technology packed in there, so I'm not sure if we can make it even thinner. It looks great on all the wrists I've seen in on so far; we're pretty excited about the cool design. As to weight--that will depend on which of our premium case material selections agrees the best with the wireless power (i.e. eddy current testing). It won't be super-light, but it also won't be heavy on your wrist. We'll know final weights a little later this year once watchcase molds are done and we have case samples. We'll be happy to weigh them and take lots of pictures. The prototype aluminum cases are pretty nice, but we're really excited for the production watchcases. @Steve Bulgin -- no magnetometer (at least not officially); that is a fun app idea :) And when I say "not officially"...we don't want to promise something that we haven't tested yet. @Andrew -- that's a great idea. It would be fun to get started on watch face concepts early. An empty screen with a big corner-to-corner X? Would a "white X on black background" or a "black X on white background" work better? We could also do concentric squares. We can write up a quick app and share the code if you'd all like to see an example of how the graphics are drawn. @CK -- we've filtered through hundreds of e-mails and comments and are posting many of the most frequently asked questions to the FAQ section tonight. So many great questions. @Ryan Sweet -- from Chris -- the only duck hunting I've done is on Nintendo, but based on that experience and playing with watch app code at the moment, I'm getting giddy too :) @Omid -- great ideas for apps! @Kristjan Ulfsson -- the 3D accelerometer is there for apps to use. It's fairly straightforward to create a pedometer app, sleep tracker, game controller, etc. AGENT is a platform for apps. That said, our sample exercise app (which can also talk to a heart rate monitor chest strap like the one our female jogger was wearing) will use it for counting steps. And if there's enough demand for a background step counter, we could use the accelerometer to count steps for any app to pick up on at any time. I'm really interested to see what creative app developers build. @Paul -- the Sharp Memory Display we're using is amazingly low-power. Think "e-paper" types of power consumption. We chose this really cool technology because it enables us to have a responsive animated UI while still displaying time all the time. The ambient light sensor can detect light level--but unless it's absolutely dark the reflective screen will still reflect some light. I've been reading time from my prototype watch outside at night, sans backlight :) @Omid Mirshafiei -- lots of fun to be had with the 3D accelerometer :) The glass lens is mineral glass. We will be testing several glasses and sapphire with production watchcases. Mineral glass has great RF transmissivity, and is much more scratch-resistant than plastic lenses. @Dude. -- from Chris -- PVD stainless steel is my #1 pick too. In the end we'll build something beautiful that satisfies engineering requirements. Fun fact: HoH's Bedlam watches have PVD Stainless Steel watchcases. I love wearing a prototype AGENT watch when I "borrow" it from engineering--and I'm super-excited for the day when I can sport one of the first production watches :) @Erik Noren -- we're finalizing the event details now. Stay tuned :) @Paul and @Francois Theroux -- since watches should be beautiful wristwear, our top watchcase material candidates are PVD stainless steel, brushed matte ceramic, and high-quality polycarbonate. Final case material selection will happen a bit later this year once we have production custom backlights and circuitry inside watchcase samples made of each material. We will select the final material based on beauty and the results of Bluetooth reception and wireless power efficiency/eddy-current results. There are some real-world cost limitations as well, but we've budgeted for high quality. The prototype watch cases were milled out of aluminum and therefore lack some of the extra detail that you'll see in production watchcases (such as the faux screw heads from the dimensions image). The final watchcases should be even prettier. :) @Paul -- the new 1.28" Sharp Memory Display we're using is the screen we're using for production. It's really awesome. On app selection--right now we've been using the Mode (bottom-left) button to switch between apps (single press) and to return to the watchface (press-and-hold). Moving towards production, we will be adding an app selection menu which will enable you to navigate more quickly into your favorite app. We will test out a few different UI options (single-scrolling, press-and-hold to page-down, categories) to enable larger lists of installed apps as well. Our goal is to keep the watch UI simple but powerful so the watch still feels like an awesome timepiece rather than a wrist-mounted computer. We'll be sharing photos and soliciting your feedback as we make that journey together. @Fabian Miro -- I'm not sure that we can record good audio at an outdoor event, but if anyone with good cameraphone video skills wants to drop by, we can try. We know that we have a worldwide community of backers, and only a small portion of you are near NYC, so we'll be covering most or all of this online over the course of the year as well. BTW, it will be a very informal event. We want to get people thinking about writing apps. We love being able to make personal connections with some of our backers. And we appreciate the opportunity to play with you on the weekend :) Regarding technology deep-dives: there's a lot of the inside AGENT (dual-processor, wireless charging, managed runtimes, Bluetooth LE, advanced power management, etc.) Are there particular things that you would like to geek out over with us? BTW, we have oscilloscopes and logic analyzers and multi-meters and protocol analyzers in the lab, and we'd love to share snapshots of the prototype-to-production process with you this year. We can't accommodate all requests--as we do need to focus on getting watches ready for the assembly line--but please let us know what kinds of things you'd like to see. We want to bring you behind the scenes and make you part of the journey in a more personal and deep-tech-talk way. @Pete Brown -- our custom Qi receiver coils are just a little smaller than the caseback itself. @Dino, @Pete Brown -- just FYI, we're bringing some of our prototypes (and even one of the dual-processor validation boards) to a free outdoor event in NYC this weekend. If you're in the area and would like to say hi, we'd love to have you drop by :) If you're a software engineer, make sure to bring your programming hat; we'll be coding watch apps and diving deep into the technology. @Paul -- from Chris -- we engineered the core electronic circuitry for AGENT before the Kickstarter campaign began. There is a lot of highly-integrated advanced technology in AGENT, and major changes to the design would derail schedules rather quickly, as you elegantly stated :) We are evaluating options regarding higher-current mains power to the Qi charger (so you could potentially fast-charge your mobile phone and use it as a portable charger). For now, please plan on a limit of 500mA 5V (per the USB 2.0 spec) and know that if we can make something even better happen we will do so. With software, services, licensed fonts, etc. -- there's a lot of cool stuff we can do there, based on the amazing extra funding from our backers. Some of that may need to happen _after_ launch though, since we need to focus our software engineering resources on final integration and testing (including things that might not be readily apparent, like writing software for our QA test equipment). @Micro Klein -- we think that volume support via Bluetooth AVRCP would be a great feature, but it's not something that we have implemented yet. It is on our short list though. @Makuri and @François and @Francois Theroux -- a logo contest would be fun! To be completely up-front, that's an area where we would need to involve the lawyers due to legal requirements in the USA--but if we could do that without getting distracted from making watches it would be awesome to involve the community on that too! @Jeroen Huurman -- I knew we shouldn't have let him wear our prototype white watch! :) We are playing with ceramics, seeing if white is possible. If it is--you'll be able to select it when you pick your watchstrap later this year. Just to be clear...white is really, really tricky. As evidenced by the elusive white iPhone...which looks beautiful but shipped really really late. So plan on black, as shown in all the photos and as described on the Kickstarter page. We'll continue playing with materials on our end :) @Kueh -- generally speaking, we use fonts that are in the 13px to 16px height range. Effectively our maximum is 16 characters wide by 16 characters tall, with whitespace on the characters. We will continue tuning this as we move towards production, but that should give you a good idea :) The AGENT logo will probably appear on the caseback, and also on the screen at power-up. @BarryKingLive -- @Erik Noren is wise :) AGENT watch apps are deployed and debugged wirelessly from your PC via Bluetooth. @Kueh -- a fierce looking logo would be a lot of fun! We have a standard-type logo at the top of agentwatches.com now, but we have some ideas for something a bit more fierce. We'd need to work on that in spare cycles over the next few months though; right now we're heads-down getting your watches ready for certification and the assembly line :) @Christophe Camicas -- since USB is the universal charging format, we're offering a Qi charger which is powered by USB. You can plug it into a USB wall adapter of course--in case you want to power it from mains power :) Almost everyone already seems to have a wall USB adapter for their smartphone already and we are trying to keep our environmental impact to a minimum, so we opted to not include yet another wall adapter. Also--so many plugs makes fulfillment more complicated, and we're big on streamlining for efficiency to help keep deliveries moving out the door :) @Mike Hole -- right now we're designing a simple alarm app that supports one scheduled alarm. It wouldn't be hard to add support for more; we'd need to figure out the best UI to support that though. But you already thought about that--based on your final sentence :) @Uwe Thomas -- yes, we have Simplified Chinese available to us as a font. We will be reaching out to our Chinese backers to make sure we support the best character set, most important characters by default, etc. An app to learn how to write Chinese sounds like a great idea! @Иван Зуб -- AGENT is brand new, so developers are just starting to integrate support into their apps. Once the preview SDK and emulator ship next month, you should start seeing some action there :) Also--music apps which support Bluetooth AVRCP should work out of the box. Windows Phone 8 supports Caller ID via Bluetooth HFP/PBAP and music control via Bluetooth AVRCP. It also support smartphone app to smartwatch app communication via Bluetooth SPP. The watch is watertight and will charge wirelessly via Qi. Good news: the Qi charger is portable and is powered by MicroUSB--so you can use it like a USB-powered charging cradle :) @Jason Wong -- we haven't tested with WhatsApp. They will probably need to build support into their app. Please ping them and ask them to support AGENT; we'll be happy to provide tools and help them implement support. @kja2ja -- it should be up within the next 67 minutes :) Just finished working out the details a few hours ago; preparing the announcement now, will get it out late tonight (NYC time). @Kueh -- we have provisions for simultaneous dual-mode operation and multiple profile endpoints. We need to lock down the memory requirements of some of these scenarios before we can promise specifics -- but we will be sure to optimize them in a way which gives you lots of power :) @Joshua Blake -- if the Audlible app supports the Bluetooth AVRCP profile, it should work! We can take some time next week to test some free apps on iPhone, Windows Phone, and Android--if there are any specific apps our backers would like us to test. We need to be careful that we don't get engineering too distracted from getting watches ready for production--but we love testing things :) @Joe Kelly -- good news :) AGENT uses dual-mode Bluetooth 4.0, which means that it is compatible with both Bluetooth Classic (BDR/LE) and the newer Bluetooth LE. This means that it can get called ID from your Windows Phone via the classic Hands Free Profile (and PBAP for contact info for phones that support it), can control music via the AV Remote Control Profile, and can communicate with apps on your phone via Bluetooth Serial Port Profile. If and when Windows Phones support Bluetooth LE, we'll support that too :) Here is a really cool WP8 + "Maze Game" demo that one of our Netduino community members (RogueCode) built: <url>"# of blocks" with most apps probably being in the 1-3 block range. We'll work out all the specifics as we move towards launch, based on developer and user feedback. We now have a Facebook home! <url>"just right" and we may ramp it up/down as well). It should be strong enough to notice--but for some of us deep sleepers it probably wouldn't wake you up consistently. It's more there for notifications. @Al_Fonce -- from Chris-- we've tested AVRCP (the Bluetooth AV Remote Control Profile) with the main music players on phones. There are other music players that do support the standard as well; as far as podcast players go...not sure. @Jonathan -- great questions. The backlight is being custom-designed for us by a major opto-electronics company. They also make backlights for some premium-quality-laptop manufacturers. :) You'll be able to check the time in bed, no problem. And since the backlight is activated by a dedicated button (top-left) by default, it won't keep lighting up when you toss and turn in your sleep, therefore preserving battery life. You could pull GPS data from your phone, no problem. There are also sensors in the device and you can pull that data and even forward it to smartphone app or another device if you wish. Finally you can pull data from Bluetooth sensors such as heart rate monitors or custom Arduino/Netduino-based devices. And yes, you can do just about anything you'd like regarding integration with a Bluetooth-enabled Arduino, either Bluetooth SPP or Bluetooth LE. The communication protocol is your own; maximum flexibility for developers is our goal. @Kueh -- from Chris -- great technical question With Sharp's innovative pixel-in-memory technology, the display is pretty darn efficient no matter whether the pixels are activated. Animations are the larger power consumers--and even that is more from the MCU (driving the animation) than the display. @Kueh -- our interface is designed to display text against a black background. It's beautiful that way, and not so beautiful in reverse. We want to make sure that we make options available for users with accessibility needs, so we are looking at configurable settings like reverse text and magnification. But while those can be great on a PC screen, we haven't been happy with anything on a small watch display yet. Working on it :) @Wayne Daniells -- we'll have an update late this evening (NYC time). We're working on a core OS enhancement which is going to be of particular interest to our international backers and should be awesome for the AGENT community overall. It should be posted in 10-12 hours. On "Kickstarter Edition" engraving...we're looking at things we can do to help differentiate your watch and show off your involvement in making AGENT a reality. We need to make sure we don't compromise schedules by adding a slow step to the process, but we're going to try to streamline in something cool :) @Kueh -- from Chris -- while the AGENT smartwatch will use standard Bluetooth profiles for Caller ID (HFP, PBAP), our testing will be limited to supported smartphones. There's a good chance that caller ID would work by simply pairing the smartwatch with a not-officially-supported-device, but you'd miss out on a lot of the AGENT experience. That wouldn't be nearly as fun. We want all backers to be get the best experience possible, so we're specifying that you should use it with a supported smartphone (iPhone 4S+, Android 2.3+, Windows Phone 8+). @Vincent Leroux -- one more quick thought: there is a Facebook "share" link under our Kickstarter video, if you'd like to share the project video+link with friends. @Charles Goh -- from Chris -- we're going to go for the highest ATM rating we can and still make the watch repairable and the battery replaceable :) There is a bit of confusion out there about what different ATM ratings mean; the following page is a pretty good resource to better understand water resistance ratings, for those interested: <url>"glass or better" materials, and we'll know exactly what we can use once we have production watchcase molds and RF test results. @FY Long -- from Chris -- we like questions :) Fashion is in the eye of the beholder of course. I know quite a few people who think that some $30,000 watches are terribly ugly and others who think they're incredibly beautiful. We work with premium materials such as stainless steel, ceramics, and high-quality polycarbonates like Lexan--so your watch definitely won't feel like it was made from the same cheap plastic mold as a $30 watch. ;) We're really excited about AGENT's fashion-forward design. The watches you see are prototype watches, so they'll get even better looking as we move to production. Chris @Andrew Warner -- just FYI, the NETMF-licensed fonts are subsets of the full fonts. We'll be sure to do a tutorial or post an update showing how to use our built-in fonts to draw text as well as embed your own custom fonts. Lots of options. @Andrew Warner -- .NET Micro Framework is already licensed for a few fonts from Ascender: <url>"like" us on Facebook, we'll be able to secure a custom URL there too :) <url>"sleeping in shifts" here this week. :) We are here to engage with our backers, to build an amazing platform together. There's a really deep technology story to tell with AGENT and lots of enthusiasm about the kinds of apps that developers will be able to build. We're here for you, to answer your questions and brainstorm ideas together. @Al_Fonce -- no speaker in the watch, but the vibration may be strong enough to wake you up. There is so much technology packed into this watch that it's super-cramped...and the piezos and speakers we looked at just couldn't match up to the quality of the rest of the smartwatch. Thank you for your support! @BarryKingLive -- sorry, no multi-packs. We don't want Kickstarter to feel like a store. @Edgar Reyes -- we've been focusing on the technology, rather than making a bunch of watchfaces. We do have a version of the analog watchface which doesn't have tick marks or a date which is kind of cool. Otherwise--once the preview SDK is up I anticipate that we'll see a TON of cool watchfaces. I can take photos of some of those running on prototype watches or our validation boards if you'd like! @Иван Зуб -- we will have a preview version of the SDK and emulator available on 20-Jun-2013. Thank you for your support! @Sakib Ahmed -- iPhone 4S was the first version of iPhone to support Bluetooth LE, which is required for smartphone apps to communicate with smartwatch apps. Any chance you'll be getting an upgraded phone by Christmas? @François -- please e-mail them and ask them to support AGENT :) Hearing from hundreds of AGENT backers goes a lot farther than just us offering to help them add support. Chris @Graham Murray -- from Chris, you'll have a lot of WP8 devs in the AGENT community, so we should be able to help each other out with all sorts of phone-related programming questions as well. @Erik -- the preview SDK and emulator will give developers the basic tools they need to draw graphics, detect button presses, and communicate via Bluetooth with smartphone apps. We're also currently evaluating the best way to expose ambient light and accelerometer data to the emulator; in some ways we want to tie directly into the host computer's sensors--but in other ways we think it might be better to enable simple controls to manually manipulate the values. We'll be seeking feedback on a lot of these items as we go from preview to final SDK, and we'll have a few releases. If you've used Netduino or .NET before, it's going to be pretty familiar to you. @Graham Murray -- will do. Since we support Windows Phone 8 and watch apps are written in C#, I expect that there are at least a few Microsoft employees who will be sporting AGENT watches too--and I'm sure they'd love to see that too. BTW, you can do SPP with WP8 today. Use the Bluetooth Networking feature (with RFCOMM). We can provide samples. @CK -- we've reached out to a number of the smartphone sports apps, and have already heard back from one of them :) If you would like to see AGENT support in your favorite smartphone sports app...please tweet or otherwise express your interest to its author. You can copy us at @agentwatches . We're here to help support smartphone app developers with their integration. @Kueh -- currently Windows Phone uses Bluetooth hands-free profile to read text messages aloud and allow you to dictate responses. If Windows Phone gains the ability to exchange SMS data via Bluetooth MAP as well, your smartwatch will be ready and waiting to embrace it :) We're looking at other possible ways to access instant messages. And of course notifications from smartphone apps are already fully supported. @Stephen Ho -- you are a man with the answers. Thank you! BTW, for those interested in the source material which validates the phone's Bluetooth radio as dual-mode: <url>“View Technical Information” 2. The first profile listed is “4.0 Host Controller Interface”; this means that the phone supports Bluetooth 4.0. 3. Now click on the link at the very top of the pop-up, “View PICS details for B019734 (Controller Subsystem)” 4. Do a text search for “BR/EDR/LE Combined Controller”. This indicates that the controller is dual-mode (Classic BD/EDR and the new LE). Having a Bluetooth LE-capable radio ("Low Energy Controller") doesn't mean that the phone supports Bluetooth LE. That's only half the Bluetooth LE stack. The other half is the "Low Energy Host" which typically runs inside the operating system. With Windows Phone 8, we've gained lots of Bluetooth features, but there's no Low Energy Host at this point. That's why Nokia markets the phone as Bluetooth 3.0. They could say "Bluetooth 4.0 BD/EDR", but almost everyone thinks Low Energy when they hear 4.0--so they're under-spec'ing. In theory a software upgrade could add the Low Energy Host and add support for Bluetooth LE. That's really up to the phone and OS manufacturer, but it would be a really cool software upgrade! @Graham Murray -- from Chris -- good question. We're actually pretty excited about the new Bluetooth capabilities in Windows Phone 8. HFP (and optional PBAP) enable caller ID, AVRCP enables music control, and SPP enables rich two-way communication between the smartphone and smartwatch apps. Plus some of the WP8 phones (like my Lumia 920) have dual-mode radios inside them. The current capabilities of WP8 are pretty great--and the potential future looks even brighter. As more and more features become available that we can take advantage of in Windows Phone, we will push the AGENT/WP integration experience to even greater levels. @David McGlynn -- from Chris -- I'm getting the sense that ColorWare is going to need to start painting smartwatches, to customize things to a whole new level for you guys :) Cool idea. @Andrew Warner -- there is a shield on the reverse side of the charging coil, so charging from the front won't work. The shield would literally filter out all the frequencies in the wireless power range :) @Minning Xiang -- We built Unicode support (UTF-8) into AGENT from day one. Watch apps can display international characters. We will provide more details on how this works soon. @Maxime Marical -- if your smartphone supports SMS via Bluetooth (MAP profile), you will see text from the actual SMS notification as a notification on-screen. :) We can also 'stack' a few notifications, in case they come in fast-and-furious. @Gaetan Gueraud -- you will be able to immerse your AGENT smartwatch in water. We will know ATM ratings once we make the molds and optimize the seals. We can't push it all the way to 10ATM like House of Horology's Bedlam watches, but AGENT will definitely be rated for more than just "accidental wetting" :) @David McGlynn -- the final design will look pretty close to the prototype. There are a few things we'll be able to do with production molds that will make it even prettier--but we locked down the design before the Kickstarter campaign so we could have a realistic schedule. @Cristian Dan -- much like modern smartphones, our focus is on making sure the user has a great experience. Like Windows Phone and iOS, this means that we need to pay careful attention to background activity. We will create a number of mechanisms for you to provide users with a great experience with data flowing in from the background, notifications, periodic data updates, etc. We're going to use best practices, including those established in modern smartphone app paradigms. What we don't want is for background apps to take a bunch of RAM, kill battery life, affect the user experience of other apps, etc. We'll provide some good capabilities here, and we'll be soliciting your feedback to help ensure we get you the tools you need to fulfill your creative vision for apps. @George Germanos -- it may be possible to add a standard 22mm steel watchstrap, but we're still working out the details. You'll need to make sure that the watch lays flat on the charger (so loop bands might not work). And wireless charging uses induction like induction stoves, so we need to make sure that your charger doesn't lose a bunch of energy in eddy currents keeping your watchband warm ;) We'll have specific guidance later in the project once test results are in. Thank you for your support! @Kueh -- the AGENT smartwatch will run one app "in the foreground" at any given time. But we're working on mechanisms to enable you to send new data to the watch so it's available to your other apps when you switch to them. And we're working on APIs which would enable re-launching an app on the fly in case something really important happens :) We'll be releasing the preview SDK and preview emulator at the end of this campaign, and we'll be using your feedback to make sure that the final SDK (which ships this fall before the watches) gives developers the flexibility to make amazing things happen. @Uwe Thomas -- sorry, that last comment was for you. Wish we had an edit button :) Sorry Vincent for any confusion! @Vincent Leroux -- the charger is powered by MicroUSB and the USB 2.0 standard is 5V 500mA--less than the higher power enabled by wall-powered Qi chargers. From our experience, most/all phones will be able to be charged by the charger. It's fairly small, so we want to use it as a travel charger for our phones too :) We'll do what we can to maximize its capabilities--but we just want to set expectations that your phone may charge at a slower rate with it than with a bigger higher-power charging pad. @Vincent Leroux -- great idea! We'll be sure to open up an online community forum for AGENT after the campaign ends. That will give us an organized place to work on apps together, create threads to talk about specific technical features of AGENT, etc. Right now we're keeping everything on Kickstarter because we want to keep things in one place and ensure that backers can benefit from everyone else's comments and questions. Thank you for your support! @Esben -- maybe someone can write an app which measures acceleration to determine when I park my car? And then reminds me where it is when I forget later? :) @Kueh -- we'd need some sort of app store and cloud infrastructure to be able to enable features like remote wipe. Additional funding may enable those sorts of things. We'll put it down on our list of "really want to haves" :) @olaf van schoten -- each watch has a 128-bit unique identifier. We're using this to pair your watch with an AGENT account, for potential app store purchases etc. We are not sure yet how best to expose the watch's identification to apps; we need to work through the privacy issues first. That is a really good question, by the way. I love the technical questions! What a great crowd. @Esben -- the numbers guy inside me recommends the phrase "trends are not projections." We are really excited about the growing funding and how it enables us to enhance AGENT watches and ecosystem, but if you stare at those numbers going up and down all the time it'll just make you crazy :) Since they're not projections, they have a huge margin of error. @Matthew Lawrence -- we are working with a major optoelectronics company on a custom backlight for production AGENT watches. The reflective screen is great in the day and when dancing on lit city sidewalks, and the backlight will take care of you in dim rooms and under new moons. :) @Ryan Sweet -- I think that a few backers may have had negative experiences with projects manufactured overseas in the past. There are a lot of logistics that make overseas manufacturing less speedy than some manufacturers would prefer. @Kueh -- we use a variety of methods for caller ID, most notably Bluetooth Hands-Free Profile. I believe that HFP should still display caller ID on your watch even if you're currently using Bluetooth Serial Port Profile to communicate between a smartphone app and a smartwatch app. We will be testing a lot of these types of scenarios. We'll be sure to provide best practices; our goal is to make the user experience both consistent and reliable. @Ryan Sweet -- from Chris -- and when I say "little weather event" I mean "Hurricane Sandy" :) @Ryan Sweet -- from Chris -- funny enough, weather is the biggest thing that keeps me up at night regarding production schedules. Last autumn we had a little weather event that knocked out power in lower NYC for a week and caused havoc on the east coast. It was the week before a big product launch (Netduino Plus 2); I was stressed :) Luckily we had started production early for that product. @Wayne Daniells -- absolutely. We're close to crossing another funding milestone which will enable us to provide a free add-on for the core AGENT OS that about half of our backers are going to be really interested in :) @warren clark -- a watch face with activity stats would be awesome indeed! @warren clark -- watch faces will be limited to a lower average power consumption. You can also create higher-power apps that display time. We just want to make sure that watch faces--which run all the time--don't eat away all your battery capacity. @warren clark -- if you're a developer, watch faces will be easy to make :) Check out the Bitmap class linked below, and its Draw methods. Those are the drawing primitives you'll use to make beautiful watch faces. You can also access data from smartphones, etc. Lots of capabilities. What types of watch faces are you thinking of making first? <url>"stretch goals" way. Check out update #1 for details. In short: we'll be primarily using extra funds to empower an ecosystem of amazing watch apps--but we'll also have some cool upgrades. For instance, when we received $300,000 in funding we were able to give all backers an optional upgrade to a premium genuine leather watchstrap. We can't do things which compromise our schedule, but there are a lot of things we can do to make AGENT even more amazing together Thank you so much for your support! @y_t_n -- from Chris -- technically USB 2.0 cables are designed for 5V 500mA power, so your phone might charge slower with the bundled Qi charger than with a higher-power Qi charger that plugs into a higher-power AC adapter. But we'll see what we can do :) No promises--but I too would love to use our charger as a travel charger for my Lumia 920! @Kueh -- .NET Micro Framework is a modular runtime. We are including the entire core and all the features which make the most sense for AGENT. Since AGENT doesn't have an Ethernet port, we're not including a TCP stack. Since it doesn't have a ZigBee radio, we're not including 802.15.4 libraries. We're also leaving out huge things that would take up space better used by watch apps--so no dispatch classes or mini-WPF. We are going to include all the add-on libraries which will be used commonly across apps (like Bluetooth, buttons, graphics, etc.) So you won't need to deploy those with your app, keeping apps nice and small. @Chucky -- from Chris -- we're actually writing up an update about that now. We are limiting production to 1,000 smartwatches per week. These are premium designer smartwatches with 2-year warranties, and we aren't going to compromise delivery to our backers by trying to make more watches faster. If you've ever seen one of our Netduino boards, you'll get a good feel for our quality standards. We coat our circuit boards in premium black solder mask, and we immerse their electrical contacts with gold. After attaching the circuitry, machines optically inspect every connection. We clean them in an environmentally-friendly circuit board washing machine. We sand down the edges of the circuit boards to make them smooth. We accent them with beautiful, custom-made electric blue electrical connectors. And then we test every feature of every board, using automated test jigs we created ourselves. Our defect return rate on Netduinos is less than 0.1%. That's astronomically low. We are passionate about quality. :) On AGENT: while we're limiting production to 1,000 units a week, we are very serious about building a community and an ecosystem of watch apps. So while we cannot compromise our ability to deliver watches to our early backers, we will be opening up reward tiers for watches assembled in later months. More about that shortly :) Chris @Rey -- from Chris -- I can sympathize :) One of the huge advantages of manufacturing in the USA is that we can do a lot of preparation for manufacturing long before we start volume production. We'll actually build the pre-production units on a small model of the assembly line. And that process will validate the build plan and help ensure that pilot production goes smoothly. BTW, when we say pilot production, we mean "making the first real watches," and that process is scheduled to start in November. We always allocate extra time for the first batch, to make sure that our manufacturing and QA processes are working efficiently and as designed. This is the time that we make small tweaks to processes, if necessary. The full process of building, testing, and boxing up AGENT smartwatches in the USA is also quicker than overseas manufacturing. We don't need to hold onto watches for a week until we fill up palettes or cargo containers. We don't need to wait for finished watches to ship to the USA from China, before reshipping them to our backers. We simply assemble, test, and ship :) I think it would be fun to take time-stamped video snapshots of the manufacturing process: watching a core circuit board being assembled and QA'd, assembling and water-testing and QA'ing the actual watch, boxing up the watch, and then shipping it off to its owner. When we say that we want to share the process with you, we're very serious. :) @Chucky -- check out Bedlam Dark Black. I think that a lot of our backers will opt for the black accent stitching for their AGENT smartwatches. It's so stealthy. :) @Chucky -- from Chris -- we're confident in our engineering and manufacturing plans. Secret Labs engineers and manufacturers electronics in volume. House of Horology builds beautiful premium watches. We have the benefit of understanding the go-to-market process well. It would not be honest to say that there is an absolutely zero chance for delays. The estimated delivery dates are estimated. But if we do run into unexpected delays, we will share them with you. You are such generous backers and it would be very unfair to wait until we're supposed to be in production and only then announce delays. We won't do that. We're on this journey together. Thank you so much for your support. We look forward to keeping you informed regularly through project updates. We are both excited and determined to get AGENT smartwatches onto your wrists. @Niklas Krebs -- yes, AGENT has built-in support for notifications. Different smartphones offer different notifications capabilities. As long as your phone supports it, we can show text messages. For Whatsapp, Facebook, and other notifications--we'll either need to tie into central notification centers or those app developers can add AGENT notification support to their apps. Our #1 goal with notifications is to make sure they work reliably. So in some cases where a phone's infrastructure doesn't meet our user experience standards, we may release the tools to support those notifications as "power toys" for advanced users. We want your watch to make you smile. :) @vader_man, @Sean McCutchen -- thanks for your support! @Peter Foreman - yes, the watch faces can show both 12 hour and 24 hour time. They can also show date, battery level, and even data retrieved from the Internet via your smartphone. For the two watchfaces we show on the main page: the digital one will show either 12- or 24-hour time; the analog one does include the day-of-month. We expect to see a huge variety of creative watchfaces. BTW--we'll store the 24hr/12hr settings and make them available to all watch faces. So as long as a watchface is designed to handle both of those, it will automatically know your preference! @Idalvar -- YES! (capitals for emphasis) :) Your watch apps will get access to accelerometer data, either on-demand or via events. Whichever works better for your application--although we recommend using events because they're very battery-friendly. @Al_Fonce -- we love France, and we're starting to prepare customs paperwork now. Shipping to France should not be a problem :) @Fabio Nagano -- sorry, no multi-packs. We want to make sure that backers realize they are joining our project to bring an awesome smartwatch to market; we don't want Kickstarter to feel like a retail store. @kja2ja -- AGENT's backlight is being custom-made for us by a major optoelectronics company. It should look great at night. The memory display is also reflective, so you may find yourself activating the backlight less often than you'd expect. Thank you for your support! @David McGlynn -- and when I just said "wristbands" I meant to say "watchstraps". Although I like wristbands too :) @David McGlynn -- both straps were designed to be the same size, style and color. The watchstraps in that photo are the leather version as noted. We'll take photos of watches with both styles and all colors of wristbands before you make your material/color selection--no worries. We want to make sure you can pick the one that's perfect for you. :) BTW, those are early silicon watchstraps on Lawrence's drawing desk at 2:24 in the video. @Adam Scott -- great question. AGENT communicates with other body-worn sensors using Bluetooth or Bluetooth LE. The particular heart rate monitor chest strap that our female runner is wearing in the video is made by Zephyr. We'll have a list of compatible heart rate monitors this fall, and app developers can create their own apps as well. @Lisa T. -- last message and this one are from Chris -- we also love the amount of extra QA we can do by assembling our electronics here too. @Lisa T. -- we love making things here in the USA too! We've been doing it with 100% of our electronics products for several years now, and it has been awesome. We've even figured out how to create our electrical designs in a way that makes domestic assembly cost effective. Thank you so much for your support. @Paul Houghton -- awesome, thank you. @Paul Houghton -- we think that tools like Augmented Smartwatch are great. We'd be happy to help support them and give them the information they need to support AGENT. It may need to come a bit later in the dev cycle, but if you're a fan of theirs can you drop them a line, let them know that you're interested in using their app with AGENT, and let them know that we're here to support them? @Clev Wong -- BB10 is very new and the Android app support is missing a few key things we'd need to support it easily. We think it's fantastic that BlackBerry has created a new OS to satiate their fans' hungriness for the latest smartphone features. Right now we're focused on iPhone, Android, and Windows Phone support. We still love BlackBerry owners; we just don't have time or resources to create a completely custom app without compromising other tasks in our schedule. When BlackBerry makes improvements surrounding some of the issues (native API access, potential Bluetooth gotchas) in their Android app support, hopefully we can show BB10 some love too :) @CK -- from Chris -- unfortunately, some smartphone accessory makers and smartphone developers don't develop for Windows Phone. Because it's so new and it has less market share than iOS and Android, it sometimes gets ignored as a small market distraction. For us, Windows Phone is a refreshing change and the developer tools (which are the same developer tools you can use to write AGENT watch apps) are simply amazing. I personally use a Lumia 920 as my mobile phone, and I love it. Because Windows Phone hasn't gotten as much support as it deserves, a lot of Windows Phone owners are a bit skeptical that--yes--we are supporting them and not just in a half-baked way. So I'm just reassuring WP8 owners that yes, the love and support for WP8 is genuine and that we intend to make our support for and integration with WP8 as great as possible. @Stephen Rowlatt -- if you have large wrists and have trouble with standard watch straps, you'll be stretching against the last hole on AGENT's wriststraps too. Since the watches are unisex, they're sized to fit tiny wrists as well. You can swap in an extra-long 22mm wriststrap of your choice; we recommend genuine leather or high-quality silicon. @Mike Zuppa -- the leather watchstraps are treated for water resistance. The silicon watchstraps are also water resistant. No scuba diving :) @Florian Kuhn -- we're already working on supporting the specific customs requirements for Germany. We'll make sure we include the proper paperwork and that the CE certifications match up; we don't want your rewards to get held up in customs. @Sacha CISZEWICZ -- no multi-packs, so sorry. But we will be sure to make watchstraps available for order when AGENT starts rolling off the assembly line. Do you have your ~1/16" hex wrenches ready? :) @Iain Patterson -- as long as the iPhone can give us the data (iMessage via Bluetooth MAP profile for instance), we can take advantage of that on AGENT. There may be some smartphone systems which aren't really designed for this and don't profile a stellar user experience; in those cases, we can always create "power toys" for advanced users so you can tap into those. With AGENT, we want to give you the freedom to take advantage of all the features of both your smartphone and your smartwatch. @Václav Muzikář -- AGENT uses a mix of capabilities to get notifications. Smartphone apps can send notification of course, and caller ID information comes from tapping into the phone's hands-free profile. As Windows Phone continues to gain great new notification capabilities, we'll continue making AGENT+WP8 integration even better. In our world, Windows Phone is a first-class smartphone citizen, not a feature-list afterthought. @Zoodle -- you only need your smartphone with you to use the fitness app if you want GPS data to show distance. AGENT has a built-in accelerometer to count steps and keeps track of elapsed time. If you want to add the heart rate data, you can pick up a heart rate monitor chest strap (like the Zephyr one our lady runner was wearing). We'll be supporting both Bluetooth and Bluetooth LE models, and will have a list of supported models later this year. We also anticipate that smartphone app developers will want to create watch apps to integrate with their own smartphone apps that feed data to the cloud and give you an amazing experience that way. @Matthew Searle -- you'll definitely be able to share your apps and load third-party apps easily through your Windows Phone 8 device. And due to overwhelming backer support, we're now looking into an official app store as well. That may need to come in stages so we don't upset our production schedule, and its sophistication will be directly related to funding level, but we're actually working out details right now. Thanks so much for your support! @Huang Mu-Ti -- iPhone 4S was the first iPhone which included Bluetooth LE. Apple's policies don't permit standard App Store apps to talk to devices using classic Bluetooth. It requires that they use the newer Bluetooth Low Energy mode. That's why iPhone 4 can't be supported. @Huang Mu-Ti -- mobile phone operating systems are really cool, but we wanted something much low power and optimized for a smartwatch. That's why we've included the .NET Micro Framework runtime in AGENT OS. It gives watch apps the similar kinds of awesome capabilities and tools that smartphone developers have--but without the huge resource requirements and battery drain. @Andrew James Brill -- we have reached out to quite a few app developers (e.g. golf, running) as well as services (e.g. IFTTT). Lots of interest there, and we've offered to support them with integration. If you'd like to see support for a particular app, please tweet, e-mail, or otherwise contact its maker and ask them to get in touch with us at <email>. There are so many cool things that could be done, making both AGENT and your favorite smartphone apps even better together. @Chucky -- thanks for your enthusiasm! We started working on AGENT in 2011, but the technology we needed to enable our vision didn't start to catch up until last year. We think it's really great that other smartwatches which shipped over the last year picked up on some of the features and best practices established by smartwatches over the last decade. But AGENT wasn't designed to compete with any particular smartwatch out there; it was engineered from the ground up to radically redefine what a smartwatch should be. In that same spirit, we're not really into copying the watchface styles of any particular brand of smartwatch. The ones we have today are based on old watchfaces that we love or were designed by our UI team. You're welcome to recreate a design for your own use and to share with friends of course ; it is pretty easy to draw with our Bitmap class methods. What we're really excited to see is fresh new ideas for watchfaces. There's a lot that can be done on this beautiful display. We can't wait to see what you create! Thank you very much for your enthusiasm and support! @Katsumi Taki -- welcome and thank you for your support! @Alibek Makhmudov -- on iPhone you have the notification center which is awesome, but also sometimes not optimal. We will be enabling a variety of notification scenarios. That will include notifications from running apps as well. Ultimately, Apple has veto power regarding what they will and will not allow us to do, but we've done a lot of architecture work in the hardware (including the inclusion of several Bluetooth communication methods) to maximize AGENT's capabilities. :) For any notification channels on iOS while are cool to tap into but just don't meet our standards for user experience--we can always build some "power toys" for advanced users which let you take advantage of those notifications as well. @David McGlynn -- from Chris -- the estimated delivery date is estimated, but we're pretty confident in it. We have been engineering and manufacturing electronics for years and have calculated our schedule with the benefit of past experience. We are also assembling AGENT circuit boards and watches here in the USA, which significantly reduces risk and speeds up production. We make all of our electronics that way, and it has worked out really well. We know that thousands of you are trusting in us to deliver a premium quality product, and our team be focused on doing just that for the next seven months. We'll be updating you regularly via project updates, and are really excited that you're joining us on this journey. @Michael Hensen -- you can use the right-middle button in your watchface app to cycle between two modes. :) On hackathons, we'd need to raise a lot of funds before we could do them overseas. But if we could do one overseas, our goal would be to do it in a convenient European location. Amsterdam? Breda, and we can snack on Mentos? :) Germany? Not sure. @Heber Acquafreda -- we love the 1.28" ~140dpi display. It's a few less DPI than the last-gen display used in previous smartwatch designs, but it's also lower-power and higher-reflectivity. It looks pretty fantastic in person, especially outside. On battery, we've said that it's "a repairable watch -- including replaceable battery". If we need to shave a tiny bit of room to get the seals watertight, we may need to make it "serviceable by technician", but our preference is to make it user-replaceable. The good news is that the battery is good for several hundred full cycles, and the battery life is a week (typical). Our main goal is to ensure that you don't have to throw away your designer watch after a few years because of locked-down design; if we can make it so you can replace the battery yourself on that multi-year anniversary, we'd love to do that :) @Michael Hensen -- and when I say stock data, I mean currency exchange data :) @Michael Hensen -- you can use the Bitmap.DrawText function to draw your scrolling text, sleep for 250ms, and then wake up and clear the text and re-draw it again a bit to the left. Repeat to scroll :) There's a DrawTextInRect function too. <url>çois -- oh so sorry, wasn't trying to get you to up your pledge. That's not what we're about. Right now we're crunching numbers for hackathon budgets and scoping out the cost and architecture for a cloud-based app store. We're also working on two other surprises that will be very happy for many of our backers :) We like to "measure twice and cut once", doing our homework and budgeting first. Sorry to make you wait a few days while we get everything in line. No fun, I know. More good stuff to come. You guys are making amazing things possible. We are so excited. @Roman Kadlec - you could certainly run a weather app on your phone which sent notifications to your AGENT whenever it knew storm/rain was coming. *cough cough* we're working on something...but we're not quite at a funding level where we can afford to do it...hopefully next week I will have some pretty cool news along these lines *cough cough* @Paul Houghton -- those are cool ideas for watchfaces. Speaking of which -- yes, you will be able to pull weather info down into your watchface. We have a bit of a happy surprise coming along those lines, hopefully by the end of next week. @Michael Hensen--any ideas what kind of watch faces you want to make first? @Caleb Wong -- AGENT is already a watch which doesn't compromise, but there are indeed more things we can do--mostly around OS features and in enabling developers to create rich apps. We will continue to make AGENT even better; you have our promise on that. Thank your for recruiting others to join in the AGENT vision and journey. So awesome. @Vincent Vong -- yes! The display is always on, showing the time. This was a critical design requirement for us. That doesn't damage the screen. The screen is very low power, combining the power benefits of e-paper with the fast animation capabilities of LCDs. @François -- we're researching BlackBerry's Android support mode, no worries :) Android 2.3+ phones--unless there's something fishy with them--should work. There is fragmentation in the Android ecosystem, and we know we're going to have to deal with that. If you have any specific concerns or technical items you'd like us to research where a specific model of Android phone has spotty Bluetooth support in the first place--please let us know and we will try to provide the best guidance we can. We are not currently aware of any Bluetooth issues on Android phone models which are deal breakers. @Swapner Feriwala -- we are working on a structure for the FAQ today. So many good questions; we'll start aggregating them in an official FAQ on the main page soon. @John -- whatever material we pick, it'll take days or weeks of engineering tests to validate the material. We don't want to announce things that haven't tested. We're working on options and making lots of calls, but we may not actually know what the best option is until after the campaign concludes. TBD, I'm sure you'll stay tuned anyway :) @Bert -- from Chris -- quick update on BlackBerry 10. It looks like some native APIs are missing for Android app compatibility, and possibly Android Bluetooth support too. We are investigating, but it looks like BlackBerry may need a version upgrade to get the kinds of capabilities needed. If anyone from BlackBerry is listening, email me at the e-mail address on the bottom of our website. @Evan Hendra -- no multi-packs, but we'll have extra straps available to order once the watches go into production. And you can swap in a standard 22mm wriststraps if desired as well. @Zoodle -- we will absolutely take photos of all the strap colors, and both the leather and silicon options. Don't worry though...you have a few months to decide on straps. From Chris -- Wow, $500,000 in funding. I'm at a lack for words. Thank you. So humbling. We're working on a list of things we can do to help empower devs with the extra funding (including helping hardware and smartphone app makers support AGENT). We have also come up with a few small things we can do to say "thank you" in software on the watch itself, both now and as backers continue to join the AGENT movement. Kueh -- dual timezone watchfaces can definitely be created. I bet that a few enterprising developers are already thinking along those lines. If we have extra time and resources we may be able to make a default one. For those who would like Endomondo support for your AGENT smartwatch: <url>"Classic Bluetooth" slaves using the Serial Port Profile or they use Bluetooth LE. The lady runner in the video was wearing a Classic Bluetooth strap from Zephyr. Yes, the AGENT smartwatch can also act as a Bluetooth Master :) @Dennis Richter -- yes, we will be working with people who understand German customs procedures to make sure our CE declarations match, the necessary paperwork is included in the box, etc. We have already started addressing this--and will be reaching out to a few AGENT community members to help make sure we do it the right way. Brazil customs is also very particular--so we will be addressing those issues too. @Huang Mu-Ti -- making a custom case for your AGENT watch would be a really cool project! The tricky part might be creating your own pushers. We are certainly big supporters of the maker movement. @CK -- your app receives timestamped events when the right-side pushers (buttons) are pressed and released. You can do long press detection for sure--or even use them as morse code inputs. Now I want to make one AGENT watch a morse code transmitter, and another AGENT watch a receiver. The second watch could print out the text on the screen in real time. Nerdy, for sure. Fun, yes :) @Chad Bentz - we have started to reach out to smartphone app vendors, to offer our assistance adding support for AGENT to their phone apps. If you have a favorite smartphone app that you'd like to see work with AGENT (e.g. running, golfing, cycling, horse racing, calorie counting, etc.) please: let _us_ know and please ask the app's creator to contact us. Our contact e-mail is at the bottom of the agentwatches.com website and they can also just e-mail us through Kickstarter. We're here to help make amazing stuff happen :) @Lisa T. -- you'll be able to put quite a few watch faces on your watch at a time, but the point you bring up is a good one: we need to make it easy to swap your current watch faces using the companion phone app. So that you feel like you're just checking and unchecking them, not installing and uninstalling apps...am I understanding you correctly? Great feedback. @Roman Kadlec, @José Antonio Castaño - we are simultaneously excited and humbled about the growing support and funding for AGENT. There are a number of important things that the extra funding will make possible, including things that will help developers create amazing watch apps (e.g. documentation, tutorials, hackathons, etc.). @José Antonio Castaño - AGENT's user interface is in English. Your content (caller ID, music tracks, notifications) will be in your native language. With enough volume we can also translate the main user interface into foreign languages--but that is a pretty big project for down the road. We have a plan to cover most major character sets, with Latin characters pre-loaded on the watch. More on that soon. @Stefan Thoolen -- we are so excited to be able to open source our new SAM4S port of .NET Micro Framework. David Stetz did so much work to make that possible, and we're super-excited that he's in love with open source as much as we are. Note that AGENT isn't an open source hardware product like Netduino--but we are going to try to contribute back to open source in several ways. @CK -- the production watches will have a menu screen that you can access, for setting the time manually, configuration, factory reset, etc. We are talking about support for simple pairing. We are paying particular attention to making sure that the Bluetooth pairing process is both robust and simple for users. Bluetooth pairing is probably one of the first things people will do when they strap on their AGENT watch, and we are passionate about making the out of box experience delightful :) @Clev Wong -- from Chris -- If a single lady was wearing an AGENT watch and was passing by, I would certainly want to know. That's' a cool lady, and I'd want to meet her for sure! I'll take that app :) AGENT's dual-mode Bluetooth chip does technically have the ability to act as slave to two masters. But working for two bosses, potentially at the same time, would be tricky. Which one would you watch be controlling music on? Etc. For version 1, we would like to reserve the second slave connection--but if we can figure out a good way to sync with two phones in the future, we can upgrade that in-field. You can plug the Qi charger into a portable USB battery pack, sure! It would be really awesome if someone built a Qi charger that had a battery inside too! That's one of the awesome things about Qi: interoperability. Just like USB, anyone can built a gadget to make your gadget better :) @RVerpalen -- yes, we will have a companion app for AGENT for iPhone, Android, and Windows Phone 8. @Abesh Bhattacharjee -- we will stack notifications. There is a limit to how much we can store in the RAM allocated to notifications, but 2-3 notifications should be fine. Worst case we cut off the "scrolled off the screen" portion of them if you get too many. BTW, you may ask: why do we pre-allocate RAM for notification when we have an awesome garbage collector. The reason is that we want your app to be able to use all the available RAM, and to have a predictable amount of RAM available. So we're trying to pre-allocate buffers for our background requirements. @RVerpalen -- I knew we shouldn't have let him wear the prototype white watch! :) We are playing with ceramics, seeing if a white watch is possible. If it is--you'll be able to select it when you pick your watchstrap later this year. White is really, really tricky. We didn't show it on the page or in the official photos because we just don't know if it's going to be possible to make at this price point and with all this technology until it's through all of its testing and certification. White is also notorious for getting dirty, requiring windows for ambient light sensors, etc. We're tinkering to see what is possible. I for one--would love to wear a white one. Chris @Kueh -- Bluetooth is on by default. We'd prefer not to have timers which turn it on/off. We' prefer to find ways to make Bluetooth even more power efficient...rather than making you look at your clock to figure out if your Bluetooth was on or off ;) Turning off vibration automatically at night (maybe even during certain hours--and when the light sensor sees that it is dark) could be a really cool "smart" feature. Great idea. Hmm :) Not sure we have time for that in version 1--but let's think about that for an in-field update. François -- you will want to run your AGENT smartwatch in normal mode, with Bluetooth on. The "watchface-only" mode is only for people who want to converse power, or who are low on battery power. Watchfaces do have access to read the current battery level. So you could make a cool digital watchface which checked the battery level every minute and drew a cool bar made of blocks on the screen which represented the remaining battery life. @François -- you are very kind. We believe in developers: they make the app world go 'round. answers: 1) We will let you choose your local culture, so that settings like KM/MI and F/C appear properly, automatically. This is something we're finalizing right now, and we'll post an official update talking about culture settings in more depth. For AM/PM and 24hr, that's up to the watchface. You set you preference, and the watchface should follow it--unless the watchface developer really only wants to use one style and in true artist fashion ignores your preference ;) 2) "Watchface-only" mode is when you only use your watch as a cool timepiece. No Bluetooth. Most users will use their watch as a timepiece normally, with Bluetooth on in the background, and then run apps a few times a day. You can actually get pretty good battery life with Bluetooth on and just using watch faces--well in excess of 7 days, but not the 30 days you can get if Bluetooth is off. @CK -- P.S. I think we determined that pairing with passcode was the least-common-denominator across all supported smartphones. We like to keep the experience consistent for everyone. But if we can find a good way to make things even simpler--while not confusing people--it's even better. That said, pairing with a 4 digit passcode once with that # on both displays isn't too bad :) @CK -- right now we're using passcode, but that's a legacy limitation of the chipset we used in the prototypes. With the new Bluetooth + Bluetooth LE stack on the production circuitry, we have a lot of flexibility. I'll revisit the pairing question with our team. Great feedback. Yes, you will be able to turn off Bluetooth on your watch. Our prototypes didn't have that ability, but our production circuitry can power down the entire Bluetooth subsystem. An analog watchface with date and day would be great. On the phone app -- that's a clever idea. No, we don't have that feature. You could build it though! I suppose that's like "find my phone" in reverse? ;) @A Blue -- your math does not compute :) Simple time/date apps (like watchfaces) are much lower power than 600uA. Like 15% or less. To eat through the entire battery in a single day, a user would need to be running a power-hungry app. We believe in freedom, so we allow you to run those--but we warn the user that it's not an optimized app and their battery life will suffer. That app would have to use about 4200uA of power (7 times the recommended amount) and the user would have to use it for 24 hours straight. Or it would have to amuse itself for 24 hours straight. I do hope that you choose to pledge for a watch so you can have your very own AGENT on your wrist. And you're welcome to write really power hungry un-optimized apps if you want :) Freedom, on your wrist. We like freedom. Anyway, let's move the conversation to another venue. I'd be happy to continue it with you privately. And again--if anyone else has questions about power management, please feel free to ask. @Kueh -- this is really tremendous feedback. Thank you. This is part of why we are releasing the preview SDK and emulator at the end of the campaign, and why we want backers to come to hackathons and test with real pre-production hardware. Your feedback enables us to take a good SDK built on an amazing platform and turn it into an amazing SDK before launch :) For your other question -- right now the user needs to activate an app. But we do have a provision for the "remote display" functionality to be activated from the phone, so I don't see any reason why we can't activate your app from the phone automatically. We'd just have to switch out the currently-running foreground application. And maybe let the user choose to be prompted for permission to launch the app. @Kueh -- sorry, just realized that I missed the second half of your question. Right now we're focused on power monitoring rather than CPU usage because CPU usage is generally super-low on a smartwatch (averaging 5% or less). Because we live in a managed code environment, we can technically count the amount of time each of your applications' instructions are running and create a full-blown CPU % measuring mechanism. But that's a pretty big job and we'd have to optimize it so it didn't consume a lot of power when you weren't using it. Phase 2+ :) @Clev Wong -- is this a computer game? How does it communicate with your phone? Or is it running on your phone? We'll provide a generic notification API which you can use, from your smartphone, to push notifications to the watch. @CK -- great questions. 1) From your smartphone, you select the watch from a list of available devices (like you would a headset) and type in the default pin. We'll be creating a UI that shows this pin on the screen. 2) You can manually disconnect and connect to the watch through the Bluetooth settings in your phone. We may also be able to expose this in the companion app on your phone. 3) Digital watchfaces with seconds can still get 30 days, but the seconds need to be on a small set of vertical lines so that the full screen doesn't need to be refreshed every second. Analog watch faces require that a lot of lines be refreshed every second between the 10 and 2 and 4 and 8 positions, so we may want to switch off the second hands in watchface-only mode. 4) Yes, no Bluetooth in watchface-only mode. Bluetooth takes around 100uA of power when it's idling, as much or more than the rest of the watch :) BTW--we've done a lot of power tuning in the hardware, but we are doing even more in the software. Questions like this really help, because tuning is in effect balancing different needs. So if second hands are really important to backers (in watchface-only mode) for an analog clock, we can literally take that into the equation. :) Chris @Kueh -- like most modern smartphones, we're generally limiting non-core apps to "just one app running in the foreground at a time." Over time we'll work on mechanisms to keep the battery life good while enabling background services (push notifications, timed thread calls, etc.) But generally your power measurements _are_ your app. BTW, when you debug your app, you will usually run it in exclusive mode. Debugging takes a bit of extra power, but you can get a good idea for how much power you're using--without anything else going on--while debugging. Finally, one note on power metering: we actually prefer to measure it with Bluetooth turn on _and_ off. Bluetooth actually consumes more power in WiFi/Bluetooth-heavy environments like skyscrapers than it does in the countryside. We're working on some ways to normalize this. This stuff gets pretty deep, but we're trying to simplify it as much as possible so developers can focus on their apps instead of the details of power management. The numbers are just there to help them optimize. @François -- from Chris -- we sleep in shifts :) Well, sometimes at least. It's really important to us and to me personally to connect with our backers and understand your passion, your wants, and your needs. We want to share the deep technical story behind AGENT with you now and as we take this journey over the next six months together. We also want to help keep Kickstarter awesome. From Chris, for everyone who loves math: On the project home page, in the "Precision Power Metering" section, we show some current measurements along our actual power consumption recommendation scale. AGENT can measure both real-time current measurement and average current measurement. Both are important, but the most important figure is average current. That's what we're showing in the gauges. The first app is averaging 600uA. Green is a happy color. Most users won't use apps more than a few hours a day, with super-efficient watchfaces running the rest of the time. But some users will keep an app running 24x7. The green area is the recommendation area for apps used around the clock, and this app is right at the top of the green area. BTW, about 100uA of the 600uA is the Bluetooth chip turned on but idling in the background, idling. 600uA * 24 hours * 7 days = 100.8mAh. That's roughly the size of our battery. The second app (yellow, 2499uA) is consuming about 4 times as much power. This is a more traditional app--one that you wouldn't run more than a few hours a day at the maximum. An example would be a connected exercise app which connects to a Bluetooth LE heart rate monitor chest strap and pulls GPS data from your phone. NOTE: for simpler "pedometer" applications, you'll use a _lot_ less power. The third app (red, 3332uA) is an app which is outside of our comfort zone a bit. This is an app which would be used only occasionally. An example of this could be an interactive game you play with another person wearing an AGENT watch--with quite a bit of Bluetooth chatter and fun animations. You can go way past the gauge in the red zone--but if you pass 5000uA by too much we need to flag the app as a "power drain" app and AGENT will need to warn users that their battery life may suffer when they launch the app (at least the first time). For fun, I'll throw out one more number: watchfaces average 100uA or less. That enables them to run for a month on a single charge. In summary, the key to good battery life is using power wisely. Much like how spending less money than we get in our paycheck helps avoid running out of money :) We've built a system around measuring and carefully consuming power. And tools for developers to optimize their apps, so that users have a great experience. We'll continue refining tools and best-practice recommendations; I'm really excited to see what you awesome folks build! @A Blue -- from Chris -- the comments section is probably not the most organized forum to drill into specific questions about battery life; lots of valuable data will get buried pages down in a day. And on the flip side, some backers may tire of digging into the same question over multiple comments and multiple pages of the comments section. If we had forums here, we'd have an awesome way to organize these sorts of "threaded" questions. Let me share some concrete examples for everyone's benefit really quick, and then we can do a really cool expansion on the power system in an update. I'd love to pull out a multimeter and grab real-time and average power consumption figures from the power metering chips. I'm pretty sure that quite a few folks here are electrical techies--or would love to learn more generally. If you have any other questions beyond this one, I'm more than happy to answer them for you--but we should take those into a private conversation so we don't clutter the comments section. If other existing backers have other power questions, we can certainly continue the power conversation here. Or we can do a dedicated project update about power--and we can chat about power in the comments for that update. @A Blue -- for better or worse, it's a complicated answer. Our math and measurements demonstrate battery life that is equal to or greater than what we're quoting as typical. In the end we make a judgment call based on measurements, calculations and experience. We trust in math and measurements :) If backers want very technical details, we can drill down into those--either here or in a really cool update where we pull out a multimeter and show you real-time stats from the power metering chips. But as far as simple explanations go..."7 days typical, 30 days watchface-only mode" is probably the best answer. We're grateful that you are backing our dream of making the AGENT watch a reality, helping us move this smartwatch onto backers' wrists. Chris @Qadiym Stewart -- so, technically, VB apps should work too. But we wanted to focus and make sure we supported C# really well with the first release. VB support in .NET MF is pretty new and we'd need to allocate some engineering resources to putting it through its paces :) That said--you are welcome to write apps in VB. We can't offer a ton of support, but you may be able to make an awesome app with it and convince us to build a bunch of tutorials. We love VB and we'd love to support it...it's just a matter of getting this first release out without scope creep :) @Adam Scott -- we can't promise that a vibrating alarm will be "silent" ;) But we will include an alarm, countdown timer, and stopwatch feature in your AGENT smartwatch. @A Blue -- if you take a look at our validation board (center of the photo in the "Road to your Wrist" section, we have jumpers which let us measure power in-line to every major subsystem of the AGENT's electronics circuitry. We can also plug into all three voltage rails. In layman's terms -- we measure power by calculating the amount of current the microcontroller and other parts are using in sleep mode, and then the power it is using when it's active in various states. We make educated guesses about how often you'll be getting notifications and how often you'll be running apps. And then we arrive at a number. This is Kickstarter, and these watches are prototypes, and we still have tuning to do. We having an amazingly power-efficient system. If you're a power-user, you can certainly get a shorter battery life. We'll even let you run apps which suck your battery dry quickly--although we'll try to give you a warning first, to make sure you understand that you're running an app which doesn't fit the power guidelines. We can't give you exact numbers today for your exact environment, your particular usage patterns, etc. But we can say that we've done and continue to do a ridiculous amount of engineering to squeeze efficiency out of the microwatts of power in your watch. @Qadiym Stewart -- the main micro has 2MB of flash onboard, and about 1/4 of that is used by the OS. .NET MF apps are tiny because they're compacted IL code, and the images are super-efficient too. You'll be able to fit a lot of smartly-coded apps and watchfaces on your smartwatch. Kueh -- from Chris -- a Calendar app on your watch would be awesome! This is something we should definitely enable. Once we publish the SDK, please email me directly and we'll find a way to make that happen. It may not be for launch, or it may need to be a collaboration of some sort, but I want that on my AGENT :) I was browsing the calendar APIs for WP8 recently! François -- we've only tested switching tracks previous/next and pause/play. But there's a lot of metadata in newer AVRCP profiles, so there's a chance we can do more there :) Or...3rd party developers can build super-music-apps! We can probably also do volume control on some phones. @Kueh -- yes, we will absolutely have an alarm and a stopwatch and a countdown timer in version 1. We're going to have to think about how to enable that from the SDK. We want to make sure apps are trustable and don't go crazy, changing your alarm time on you. ;) Once we release the preview SDK and emulator, we'll be asking for tons of feedback. We'll use that feedback to refine it into the SDK and emulator you'll get before the watches ship. We'll also hold hackathons (we can afford one in NYC now, more in other metros with more funding) with pre-production hardware so you can test your apps and tune for power consumption. We're here to give you more power, for amazing apps. Let us know what we need; we can start that conversation right now. @Kueh -- right now we're focused on enabling apps to be launched on-demand by the user (by selecting the app). You will also be able to launch the "secondary display" app on the watch from a compatible smartphone app, automatically. That said--we are evaluating ways to implement the task scheduling and background worker-type features that you see on platforms like Windows Phone 8. We can't promise anything for version 1--but we have an amazingly powerful core platform and we can do a lot to extend it. We just want to make sure we do it cautiously, so that apps and users don't suffer. This is a tiny device that doesn't have the massive resources of a PC or smartphone. But we can do a lot with a tiny watch :) @François -- as a watch-wearer, Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth LE will work the same from the user point of view. Range is different and Bluetooth LE gives us some cool features. Also, some of the features like music control have to go through Bluetooth Classic anyway (using the AVRCP Bluetooth profile). Our goal with the dual-mode radio is to make sure you have a super-capable watch. You can let us worry about making the technical side work, and focus on getting joy out of your watch. And if you're a developer or a technology enthusiast, please ask tech questions! There are SO many tech tidbits we can share. We're engineers...and we dig deep. Y. Chung -- from Chris -- we actually have to be careful to _not_ change the core design of the watch, or else we'd compromise our schedule. There's always room for a version 2 down the road. We're building both an amazing smartwatch and a platform for the future here. And right now we need to focus on delivering smartwatches and empowering developers. The only things we really left out that we'd love to pack in are _really_ expensive and in some cases compromise other parts of the system. Well, and we couldn't use outer-space-grade components ;) We pretty much got everything we dreamed of in there--after many many revisions. We do have a few other things we can do as upgrades to the watch itself as we get more funding from our amazing backers; most of those are software and feature related. More to come on those as we can afford to do them. We are _so_ humbled at the outpouring of support. Hi Y. Chung, great question. As an electronics company, price is always on our mind. Our Netduino boards are really nice--yes surprisingly affordable. We do a lot of revisions to find ways to pack both premium and affordable into the same package. In the case of AGENT, we knew that we wanted to build a smartwatch with no compromises but we also knew that we couldn't go blue-sky-crazy. So we first picked the components that we had to have to meet our design goals--and then we added the things that we wanted to have. At the $100,000 goal our cost was actually a little bit over our price target because we packed so much in--but the extra funds from new backers are enabling us to bring that cost down a bit and squeeze in an extra upgrade or two without affecting the schedule. The leather watchstrap upgrade is an example of that. @BarryKingLive -- No problem; questions are great! No piezo/speaker inside. Tiny speakers don't sound so awesome, which didn't match with our premium quality design. It's also very tight in there--and subtle vibrations are a really nice way to know that you just got a notification :) Loud beeps in a meeting...not so good. Chris François -- just so you know, the most recent versions of Bluetooth on Android are not super-compatible with Bluetooth LE across the board. So it's actually the Bluetooth Classic side of your phone--with Bluetooth SPP for phone-to-watch data communication--that you'll be using. If the next version of Android gets awesome standardized Bluetooth LE support...then we'll be able to switch you over on the fly :) @Paul Houghton -- P.S. If we do install a few extra apps on the watch by default (so you have more fun things to do right away), you will be able to remove them. We'll do some user experience testing to see which way feels "right". @Paul Houghton -- out of the box, it will tell time and invite you to make it your own by downloading apps through your phone :) We'll provide sample apps for all of the features in the video -- and we're making it possible for a world of 3rd-party apps to meet your desires. :) @Erik Noren -- oh! So currently the watch will come pre-installed with time/stopwatch/timer, the core OS (for settings, etc.), music control, and perhaps the sample weather app. We don't want to clutter it. We'll have additional apps from Secret Labs (sample exercise app, for instance), and there should be quite a few apps from 3rd-party developers (backer developers!) at or near launch. Remember--AGENT is a smartwatch platform running a really nice OS/runtime. So it's all about the apps that you customize your watch with. @Paul Houghton -- the photos are of our latest prototypes, precision-milled out of aluminum and powder coated. We're still evaluating materials (stainless steel, aluminum, brushed ceramics, nice lexan materials) to determine which one is most beautiful, rugged, and RF-passive. The top-left button activates the backlight; bottom-left changes apps; three buttons on the right are up/select/down and can be used for custom purposes by apps. So sorry, but not quite sure what your second-to-last question is asking. Can you ask again, in different words? Thank you. Any accent color around the rim is probably a reflection :) The watches are gorgeous. Thanks for your support! @Joe Kelly -- you really don't need to worry about the watch losing time. Unless you leave it with the battery dead. And yes, for phones where we can run an app in the background, it can automatically sync time and update your time zone when you get off the plane :) As far as airplanes go: you can turn off the Bluetooth radio in AGENT. You can also turn it "off". Some countries have laws about operating wireless devices on planes, so we are giving you the option to exercise your good judgment there. @Caleb Wong -- thanks for the PM. We're typing as fast as we can. So many backers; we want to make sure we respond to every message :) The bundled Qi charger will look similar to the one in the photo. Small, rounded, MicroUSB-powered. For Kickstarter backers--we'll do something to show off your backing status. @Maxime Marical -- from Chris -- Melon does look pretty cool! Can you ping them and ask them to email us? Contact info is at the very bottom of agentwatches.com. We'll ping them too. We'd be happy to help them put together a Melon app for AGENT. Thanks! @lumar -- thank you for the feedback. We'll see what we can do with materials to keep AGENT looking nice after some abuse :) @Stefan Thoolen - we're not sure yet if we'll be able to adjust vibration strength from software. We really need to get the final watchcase molds and everything bundled up to determine what kind of range capabilities we have there. On a technical note, we drive the motor via PWM. So yes, in theory, we can adjust its speed via software. Also...you can pulse out vibration patterns. Which should be fun. Just don't use up all your battery power making the watch dance around a table! :) @Dylan Dwyer - AGENT has a nice vibration motor. You can pulse it to create vibration patterns. No speaker. We want a waterproof watch--and most tiny speakers are tinny. Tinny is not premium. @Erik Shinkle -- from Chris -- we're tuning the vibration motor to be strong enough for you to notice but not so strong that you want to tear it off your wrist :) I don't know that it would be a great alarm, at least for me, since I tend to sleep pretty soundly. @Srihari Paulsamy -- the weather app is getting data from a smartphone app (which got the data from the Internet). Some phone platforms could enable us to effectively set up an HTTP proxy of sorts on the phone too--so that opens up a whole other world of possibilities down the road. @Dung Nguyen -- yes, we will absolutely provide an online community. We do this with Netduino today (at <url>çois -- AGENT is pretty powerful and flexible. Developers will write watch apps that run on the watch. And some developers will just write code _inside smartphone apps_ which uses the watch as a remote Bluetooth display. Lots of options, for maximum capabilities. We recommend writing native watch apps in C#, since it gives you the best performance and best battery life. P.S. Ooh, that offer sounds delicious! So tempting. Nom nom nom :) @Srihari Paulsamy -- 1) We won't know weight until we finish testing materials for RF passivity and watertight-seal compatibility, but it won't be super-light or super-heavy. 2) The Qi charging plate does come with a USB cable that can charge from a PC or your wall adapter. We don't include a wall adapter because that _really_ complicates international shipping and frankly everyone has one and we don't want to add to landfills any more than necessary. 3) The watch can keep a constant connection to the phone, albeit preferably one that's a low-power sleepy link. It gets GPS from your phone, from a companion app (either ours or a third-party app). Great questions! @Dylan Dwyer -- that's a great question. First, yes, the flash is permanent (non-volatile) storage. If you reboot or replace the battery, it will retain data. If you remove the battery, you will need to set (or re-sync) the time again of course. When the battery is almost completely dead, the main micro will shut off and you'll lose your current time. We do have a "rough" internal RTC on the second micro which can keep time for a while longer, but we're not sure if we want to enable that: time that's not quite accurate could be annoying. @Maxime Marical -- we know that customs in Germany and Brazil are particular about everything matching up, and will be working with knowledgeable people in Germany and with German customs if necessary to make sure your watches are shipped with the proper CE markings, paperwork, etc. @François -- from Chris -- shipping to France is a big yes. We can't ship to countries that are embargoed by the USA like Cuba and North Korea. I just wish I could deliver the watch to France personally and enjoy some French culture and delicious croissants! @TheIndieArmy -- ifttt.com would be cool. AGENT has a powerful dev platform, so it's highly likely someone (or many someones) will build support for it. It would be cool to get an AGENT icon on ifttt.com for recipes too. @Huang Mu-Ti -- from Chris -- no special titanium edition, although that would be cool! I love that kind of metal too. Also unobtanium, although I haven't been able to get my hands on any yet. :( On a more serious note, we need to keep the watch case materials consistent so that FCC test results are compatible across watches. Designing, tuning, and certifying these products for worldwide distribution is a big part of our road to production, and we don't want to add complications that can cause unnecessary delays. We're focused on delivering, enabling us to do more cool stuff with our backers down the road. @Brandon Higgins -- AGENT is a premium watch, and is designed to last you for years of use. The battery should last at least 2 years, with 100s of charge cycles. And yes, the watch can be repaired--including replacement of the rechargeable battery. That was one of our key design requirements. We'd love to see iOS 7 open up and enable even more use scenarios than the powerful set we have today. The amazing competition from the other phone platforms makes our world happy. @Dung Nguyen and @Huang Mu-Ti -- really good point. Since AGENT has Bluetooth SPP, you can certainly write watch apps which talk to apps on your PC or Mac. It doesn't depend on your smartphone, but both your phone and watch are even better when they're together. @José Antonio Castaño -- we don't know how many notifications iPhone can reliably support--but we'll work within Apple's constraints to give you a great experience with your watch. We may also be able to tie into notification center, etc. via "powertools" if you want to amp things up further. @José Antonio Castaño -- every phone and phone OS has its own peculiarities. Caller ID, music control, notifications from apps--all of that is available on your iPhone 4S. Until we submit our app to Apple's App Store, we won't know with absolute certainty what they'll let you do with your phone and your watch--but based on our tests, their documentation and other approved iPhone apps we have high confidence that you'll get tons of great functionality with iPhone 4S and the AGENT smartwatch. @Maxime Marical -- we'll publish a preview version of the SDK and emulator immediately after the Kickstarter campaign ends (in 28 days). We'll take in all the feedback to refine that into a final production SDK, so that we can have lots of apps before AGENT watches start arriving in mailboxes :) @Martin -- we're working on a list of character sets that we can support. AGENT uses Unicode to store all text (in UTF-8 format). It's been built for international language support, from day one. Our UI is in English, and we have an "English and accented characters" font on the device. Of course apps can embed any font they'd like in any language. And even better--the extra Kickstarter funds are going to help us license fonts for other character sets (such as Cyrillic) so that notifications come through in your native language. There are some limitations since apps might not know what to do with beautiful RTL languages like Hebrew--and some character sets are just too huge for a little watch. We're not sure how much this is going to cost, or if some of them might need to be small software add-ons (via an app store), but we're aware and we're working on it. @A Blue -- we love that there are so many watches in the world to pick from. It makes it easy to find one you love. And with AGENT, you can even switch up the watchfaces so that you arrive at events in personalized style. I think that you might be getting a bit of pushback because most of the people here are here because the believe in the AGENT vision and they want to help make it a reality, and so they'd like to keep the conversation on the topic of what they can do with AGENT, how they can do it, and what they can do to make everyone's watches even more amazing. Anyway, thanks for your support. We're so excited that you all have helped us make AGENT a reality. @sudeep raju -- no official support for Blackberry 10, but if someone from Blackberry wants to give us a call--we'd be happy to see what we can do to support you guys too! Do you know anyone over there? [Note: it might need to be very basic support at launch, if any. We're very focused on delivering what we're working on now--and we don't want to compromise schedules with scope changes. I know I say that a lot, but "keeping trains running on time" is pretty important.] @Pete Brown -- we heart you too. Thank you for your support! @David McMurry -- purple accent stitching would be cool! @TheIndieArmy -- if you want a stealth look, go for the black stitching. It gives it a bit of style but generally looks pretty awesome. See <url>" hex wrenches :) @cherepets -- Windows Phone 8 has Bluetooth support for talking to devices like AGENT. Wnidows Phone 7 was awesome--but missed this one critical feature. Any chance a happy elf is bringing you a WP8 upgrade this Christmas? BTW -- you _may_ be able to get Caller ID and music control to work with your WP7 device, since we use standard Bluetooth profiles. Not something we've tested, but we do use standards. You would not be able to load watch apps onto your AGENT from your WP7 though, for sure. @Huang Mu-Ti -- Agent has a 3D accelerometer, so it can count steps and sense motion in apps, no problem. It also has Bluetooth--so it can pull in heart rate data from a chest strap (like the one our female runner is wearing in the video) and GPS data for distance (from an app on your cellphone). Tons of connectivity options; developers will take that connectivity and run with it. :) @David McMurry -- additional case colors like Purple would be cool indeed. But those are also the things that can really drive a schedule off its tracks, with lots of materials testing required and possibly a second set of FCC/CE testing. Straps and watchfaces are a great way to personalize your watch--and I bet that third parties will come up with some creative skins of Colorware-style paint options for those who want to really amp up the personal factor. @Dylan Dwyer -- our goal is to build a watch that doesn't need a screen protector. If it's a concern for you, we'll be happy to work with one of the screen protector companies to help them cut some film. On NFC, we looked at NFC, but it's so darn expensive and the dual-coil (Qi + NFC) would have made the watch too big. We're still looking at it, and we would love to build a watch with it down the road someday. @Roman Kadlec -- 1. Qi is smart, and the wireless charging chip in AGENT is clever. Just set the watch on a charger, wall-powered or USB-powered. The charger won't deliver more power than requested and the watch won't overcharge the battery. 2. There's no contact book in AGENT today, but I can't think of a reason why that app couldn't be created by us or a third-party. Not sure how efficient it would be as an app--but it would be cool :) @Maxime Marical - we will provide an AGENT app for your smartphone (iPhone, Android, Windows Phone). You'll be able to use it to load apps onto your smartwatch. Sorry if that wasn't clear! We do love Sapphire, and it's used on the Bedlam watches. We're actually testing it and other glasses with AGENT, determining RF performance. The glass lens that's on the prototypes is really nice and hasn't scratched, and I'm terrible about scratching things. -- Chris @Ng Boon Chin - the Qi charging base is comparable, but since it's powered by USB you won't get high-amperage charging like you can from a wall-powered Qi charger. It's Qi 1.1 compatible. For the watch--it's perfect. Regarding your phone...it will probably charge your phone slower. @CK -- Melon looks pretty cool! Do you know if they use Bluetooth Classic or LE? We support both--but if they use Bluetooth LE they might be able to create a low-power app on AGENT which graphs data on an always-on screen! @Kristin -- we'd love it if you take photos and share them with the community when you get your watch; we're pretty confident that you'll love it. We really want you to get a smile on your face when you lace it on your wrist in the morning. :) @Kueh -- the female runner in the video was wearing a Zephyr heart rate sensor (chest strap). But AGENT isn't really limited to any one chest strap. We'll support at least that one in the sample app--but our creative community of developers is bound to support quite a few others as well :) I would wait before going out and buying one to use with your watch though, until we have a list of officially supported ones or your favorite app developer has one for you. We can't officially recommend any specific products from other companies--but we may be doing some "preference testing" to determine which ones we want to support in the sample exercise app. Bluetooth SPP or Bluetooth LE (GATT) is what you'll want the heart monitor to support. @Kristin Lear -- AGENT is unisex, and looks pretty awesome on a lot of women. Right now we're super-focused on delivery AGENT watches to our backers--but we'd love to make a specifically-feminine version some day down the line. Thank you for supporting us! @Abhijeet Pathak -- you want to run a sleep tracker in the background, so that you can use another app in the foreground--while you're asleep? :) :) :) Right now we're running all apps in the foreground on the watch, similar to how smartphones limit background processes to preserve stability and battery life. We are looking into ways to enable activation of background threads on demand (via notifications, etc.) but I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves for version 1. Let's see what we can build with the current powerful SDK--and then we'll tune and refine from there. @YAN KIN MAN -- The prototypes in the video and the photos feature the leather straps already. Our silicon watchstrap design is spec'd to mirror the size and stitching of the leather straps--and we wanted to make sure that we represented the final design as closely as possible. We'll take photos of AGENT watches with both the silicon straps and the leather ones, so you can pick your preference. For most people, it'll simply be a material preference--since they're the same color and size and the same color of stitching. If you skip to 2:24 in our Kickstarter video, you can actually see a bunch of our early prototype silicon watchstraps on Lawrence's drawing desk. The prototypes are nice, and the production ones will be even nicer. @Abhijeet Pathak -- AGENT has a built-in 3D accelerometer, so you could run a watch app which tracks sleep. Absolutely. There's no built-in app for that today, but I anticipate that quite a few developers who backed this project are already thinking about building a sleep tracking app. I'd use a sleep tracking app for sure! On features you can use without your phone--it's basically anything except for GPS (distance, location), data that's on the smartphone, and your Internet connection. We should make one of our project updates all about this actually, helping everyone understand the powerful things you can do with AGENT standalone--and then what additional things you can do when it's connected to your phone, to a heart rate monitor chest strap (like the female runner in the video), etc. @Robert Holbert -- you have an update :) We wanted to make sure we found the right way to say "thank you" so it took a few extra minutes. You folks are AMAZING. @derek williams -- funny enough, Corning kind of had the same reaction when I called them. @Brad Haigh - oh yes, so true. And here in the USA, we have some states that opt out of DST. And some that do DST in part of the state but not in others, split the state into different time zones, etc. Luckily we have the kinds of engineers who--if you ask them what time sunset is--they'll ask if you "civil, nautical, or astronomical?" :) We'll be hammering away at these kinds of little details; just please let us know if we missed something so we can make your experience awesome. @Huang Mu-Ti -- so sorry, I didn't know that model was a phone. Cool. The Bluetooth 4.0 radio in the production AGENT watches is dual-mode, so it works with both classic Bluetooth (2.1/3.0) and the new Bluetooth Low Energy mode (only found in Bluetooth 4.0). So if you have Android 2.3 or newer, and Bluetooth 2.1 or newer, you should be good to go. @Thomas Trutch -- as Lee alluded, iPhone 4 doesn't have Bluetooth LE. iPhone 4S added Bluetooth LE, enabling phone apps to communicate with peripherals (and therefore watch apps). Technically you may be able to use your phone with the caller ID and music control features--but we haven't tested that. Apple should release a new iPhone this year; any chance Santa can get you one (or even a 4S) for Christmas? :) @Christopher Burnett -- The anti-glare glass lens is mineral glass. We love glass because it doesn't scratch easily. We're evaluating other types of glass as well--but so far mineral glass has the best balance of clarity, scratch resistance, and RF passivity. It's also pretty :) @Rodney Bowman -- we built a watch that doesn't compromise, so we didn't really leave anything "out". And we don't want to compromise our delivery dates. So we need to do "stretch goals" a bit different than the traditional way. Combined with feedback from backers, we're actively investigating ways to enhance backers' watches--and ways that we can support developers even better (so that your watches do even more). Crossing the $300,000 threshold enables us to offer the first stretch bonus; we'll share details about that a bit later tonight. We are so humbled and so grateful for all of our backers' pledges--and we want to make sure we leverage those funds and find smart ways to enhance your rewards. We're super excited to do so. @Omar Shareef -- for backers who have pledged so far, estimated delivery is this December. @Dylan Dwyer -- yes, we'll take care of day of week for you and all that. Also DST and summer time, although that's a complicated one so we may need to tweak that in-field if we don't get a specific country's DST requirements straight. Here's a link to the System.DateTime class documentation: <url>"on the minute" rather than continuously. It's as fast as a traditional LCD, but animating continuously will put you into a higher power-consumption tier. @Cody Sloat -- that's a great idea. We definitely want to give backers something which says that their smartwatch is a Kickstarter Edition--that they helped make the AGENT smartwatch happen. @Francis Beaulieu - we can look into making a special 30ATM watch in the future for diving. Right now, we are staying focused on delivering the best all-occasion smartwatch possible to our amazing backers :) @Michel -- that's really good feedback. We are compiling a list of FAQs today, to add to the main page--and will also see if there's a good way to fit some more specs in there. The main page already has so much technical content--and we'd love to add more--but we don't want to make it tiresome to wade through technical specs, however excited we are about them :) And we don't want to wear you out wading through comments here, looking for extra specs, either! With your feedback, we'll try to find the right balance there. Thank you for your support! Chris @Paul Houghton -- yes, we will continue adding enhancements to the watch and publishing firmware updates via the companion phone app. We are also looking into how much power we can deliver from our Qi charger, when plugged into a wall USB adapter. That may not be something we know during this campaign--but I do agree that it would be great to get a small portable charger that charged your phone too! Chris @eliter1 -- you can swap in other 22mm watchstraps if you'd like to customize even further. The silicon watchstrap is great for exercising and swimming and looks good for regular use too. The stitching really helps set it apart. AGENT uses two ~1/16" hex screws to attach the watch pin, which is a really cool design feature. You can just grab two ~1/16" hex wrenches and swap out the strap in a minute! Just make sure not to torque them crazy tight...hex wrenches give you a lot of leverage :) @Huang Mu-Ti -- technically AGENT will probably work with Android tablets in addition to Android phones. We're really focused on the phone experience, but we'll be looking at tablets later this year. We'd love to support Surface too. It's likely we also support iPad out of the box (except without caller ID, since iPad has no "phone" feature)--but we haven't tested that. We do use standard Bluetooth profiles (HFP, PBAP, RVACP, SPP, etc.) @Abesh Bhattacharjee -- the brand new Cortex-M4 micro that we're using is the ATSAM4SD32. It has 2MB of onboard flash and 160KB of RAM -- and RAM retention in its ~33uA sleep mode. For a microcontroller, it pretty hefty--and it's one of the keys to our advanced power management. Managed code executables are pretty small, since IL code is concise and most of their core logic is in runtime classes which are already in flash. That means that some apps will be just a few hundred or a few thousand bytes. Some watchfaces will be 8BK or less with 1-bit compressed graphics. Some apps will be huge and powerful. To make this simple, we're allocating "blocks" to apps. We'll have about 50 blocks--although this number may change (possibly going higher and making blocks smaller to be more efficient). We want developers to have an easy way to predict their storage capacity and users to have a simple system for measuring how many apps they can fit onto their wrist-wear. Chris @Caleb Wong -- part of what we'll be using the extra Kickstarter funds for is extra UI design and developing some guidelines recommendation. We are big fans of Alan Cooper's design philosophies, and will be reaching out to some of our UX friends. Right now we've kept things simple and efficient--and we'll continue that--but we'll also be able to make things even prettier and refine the intuitive nature :) @Glass -- we haven't noticed any major drain on battery life from Windows Phone 8 running Bluetooth. It all depends, really, on how much chattering your apps are doing. High-CPU games on a phone can drain battery quicker than casual games, for instance.. Luckily we have power metering on the watch to help developers understand how much power they're using there--and you can estimate phone Bluetooth consumption somewhat from that too. As phones gain Bluetooth Low Energy support, apps can focus on small efficient packets of data. Bluetooth LE still takes power, and dual-mode radios aren't as efficient in LE mode as single-mode radios, but it does extend power when software is optimized for it. @Francois Theroux -- the strap with "gray" stitching is the "black" strap. It's pretty dark, although we used lots of light when we took the strap color photo. The straps are pretty durable. We can't guarantee crack-proof, but we're pretty confident in them. They feel nice too. @CK - the current watch face is the home screen. This isn't a smartphone, so there's no a big menu to greet you when you turn it on. Instead, it tells time. And then makes it easy to access the other apps and rich featureset. Being a fantastic watch, before everything else, is really important. If you have 30 watchfaces installed--which is probably a lot more than you'd normally want--you can rotate between them with the top and bottom buttons on the right side. Apps will be listed in an app selection menu (accessed by the bottom-left button). They're completely separate from watchfaces, since they're logically very different beasts. This gives you good, simple organization too. BTW--you can press and hold the bottom-left button at any time to go back to the watchface :) @Weisgerber Laurent -- 1. Power consumption is spec'd at 60uW (power) -- which is 20uA (current) times 3V (voltage) :) But that's just a number thrown out there. There's static power consumption, power consumption when the display is changing, etc. We have lots of ways of optimizing this even further, including only refreshing screen lines which have actually changed. 2. Water resistant, ATM is TBD. Getting caught in the rain, washing hands, immersing in water are all fine. We're going to push this as far as we can reasonably do so...but we really won't know until final seals are done. We don't want to overpromise. No scuba diving, we know that :) 3. The display we're using is high-resolution, and perfect for raster fonts. Honestly you can write text so small that it's hard to read, so we're using a font that's a step bigger (and you can use even bigger fonts). We have good contacts at premium technology suppliers, and are continually evaluating the newest upcoming technologies. AGENT uses this display because it's best-in-class. 4. We are well aware of European (especially German) customs regulations. And the same for Brazil. We're already in touch with our friends in Germany and Brazil, and we'll be working with them and the appropriate customs requirements so that CE certifications are correct, paperwork is included properly, etc. Sometimes snafus happen, and we all do the best we can. But this has been one very specific concern for us--and we're on it. 5. We'd love to have an app store. Right now we're focused on empowering developers to create powerful apps with great battery life, and deploying those via side-loading (inside "application domains"). We're looking at how to structure an app store, and we've already gotten some of the financial details worked out for developers (US bank accounts ATM, working on international). We'll continue down this path between the Kickstarter campaign and delivery--but I don't have a date or official commitment to particulars around an app store. We want to do things right, not rush them. 6. Watch apps install on the watch. It's a real platform. You will also be able to use the watch as a remote display, from native code on your phone, via Bluetooth. But on-watch apps are the ultimate. @Heiko Schumann -- we built a watch which doesn't compromise, and we already designed the core circuitry (which was very time consuming, and needed to happen before we launched on Kickstarter so that we didn't introduce crazy delays). BUT...we have identified a few ways that we can make backer watches even better courtesy of the extra funding. And we will be able to do more "boring but really nice" things for developers, like hiring a technical writer to flush out the documentation nicely. We will be announcing the first upgrade made possible by the extra funding by this evening NY time(within the next ten hours). We're finalizing the details right now, to make sure it doesn't compromise our ability to deliver. @BarryKingLive -- thanks for backing us! We're both humbled and excited at all the amazing support! Yes, we run the .NET MF runtime on the watch. You'll have a SerialPort-style class which can pull data from a phone app via Bluetooth. So whatever you want to pass between watch and phone--you have the power :) For REST, you'll want to pull data down on the phone and then transfer it down to the watch. Or capture push notifications and pass them along, etc. We're looking at standard ways to implement some of this, so that everyone can benefit from standard developer services; this is a good candidate for that. No HttpWebRequest on the watch for pulling down data--but technically even that is possible. It would just take a lot of code space. For now, pull data down on your phone and then shuttle it to the watch whenever you need it. For drawing, there's a rich Bitmap class in .NET MF with all the basic drawing primitives. Your app can either exist in "full-screen" or "regular" (with battery and time at top) view--and your canvas will be sized appropriately. Fun fact: the Bitmap class was created for .NET way back in the SPOT watch days a decade ago. .NET MF is a decade newer and radically more awesome than the tech back then, but the drawing primitives are tried and true and awesome. Just call Bitmap.Flush() to update the display when you're done drawing. <url>"watchfaces" vs. "watch apps": 1. Watchfaces are allocated a lower average power budget (as measured by the power metering chip), to ensure really long battery life in watchface-only mode. You will be able to create and use watchfaces with excessive animations if you really want--but when the user switches to watchface-only mode, you'll need to cut down the power consumption :) 2. Watchfaces only get one pushbutton instead of three, the middle-right pushbutton. They should use it to turn on/off seconds, do a fun animation, etc. The up and down buttons on the right side switch between watchfaces. All that said, two more things to add: 3. You can create a watch app which shows time, if you want to use the three buttons on the right for advanced scenarios. Because of our low-power architecture, it can run all the time without "timing out" after a while and returning to the watchface. 4. We may logically separate watchfaces from watch apps in the companion phone app, since people often think of them as separate things. But that doesn't mean they're technically different :) @Kenneth Salomon - we believe in a repairable watch with a replaceable battery, and the next standard battery size is quite a bit bigger. There's a lot of technology in this watch in a very compact space. But we'll continue looking at ways to tune battery life even further via our advanced power management system. The precise power measuring chips really help out here... When you understand how much you're spending, it's much easier to live well on a small budget. If you just spend and spend energy, you can find yourself energy-broke quickly, just like a runaway bank account :) @John -- this is not supported today, but we can investigate it in the future. Our Bluetooth radio technically supports being two slaves at once. But we may want to reserve one of those for advanced features with a single phone. We'll know later this summer/fall for sure. The other concern, of course, is with apps. Which phone has priority? Which phone syncs? Etc. Lots to think about :) @Eliazar Terraza -- our Qi charger is designed for the watch. You could use it to charge other devices--but it might charge them slower than a mains-powered charger. We might be able to make our charger output a higher current by plugging its USB cable into an AC adapter--but that's not something we've tested yet. We typically stay with USB specs of 500mA for USB 2.0, but we know this is an important feature. So we will certainly put it on our research list. @CK -- don't worry about the battery. It's good for several years and several hundred charges. We can keep track of the cycle data in the watch as well. Charging it 10% ten times is about the same thing as charging it 100% once. I wouldn't put it on and off and on and off the charger every 5 minutes...but I wouldn't sweat it :) @Raymond Ng -- Kickstarter doesn't allow multiples in rewards, so that people don't think that prototypes are ready-to-ship finished goods. Which we think is a very reasonable policy. If you want to message me, at a minimum I can get you on a priority list for getting a second watch after the Kickstarter backers' rewards ship. We're here to take care of you; we just want to be good Kickstarter citizens at the same time. @Kuber Chib -- Bluetooth 4.0 is backwards compatible with Bluetooth 2.1, so classic Bluetooth functions (BD/EDR, SPP/AVRCP/PBAP/etc.) will work fine. We don't have a list of phone that concretely work with call answer/reject/etc. quite yet. There are several factors that we really need to test in the field, such as if the user also has a headset attached or a car kit. For now, just pretend that you'll get caller ID and can silence the buzzing...and we'll work to exceed your expectations :) Great question, BTW. Thank you. @Imran Ali - yes, the watch has a vibration motor built in. The "phone lost alert" will vibrate the watch, as will other notifications. We are set up so that caller ID could even vibrate differently based on caller, "vibration tones" if you will. Not implemented yet--but if there are requests it's easy to do for a few callers. @Janardan Nathan - great questions. 1. Yes, we'll be providing a number of watch faces. We wanted to show some variety so we showed one digital and one analog. Several community members are already thinking of new watchfaces...so you should have a lot to pick from :) 2. Estimated charging time from empty is 2 hours. So consider that a day of battery for every 20 minutes of charge :) 3. The top of the watch case is approximately 38mm tall and 35mm wide; the watch case is approximately 12mm deep. The 22mm watch strap attaches to lugs at the ends which add a bit of length, snuggling your wrist. 4. Technically you could probably use Bluetooth LE with some fixed nodes in a home to locate someone. Legally we can't recommend AGENT for life-critical applications. 5. You will be able to cancel phone calls. With compatible phones you can also answer, end, etc. We're adopting the standard hands-free profile to provide these features and caller ID. @Aman Matharoo -- the display is a really cool new Memory Display from Sharp. It comes in one color, black :) If you're looking to change the color of your watch, there are companies that do that (skins, colorware, etc.) But I would wait to see your watch first...I so love the black. @Aman Matharoo -- If you've programmed in Java or C# before, it's pretty easy to make apps for the watch, and for the phone. You can use the same language for both. And to talk between then, you just write a few lines of code to open a Bluetooth connection. Thanks for your support! @CK -- the brand name appears when you boot the watch :) Generally, we're against throwing logos on the front of hardware. It can ruin symmetry and beauty. It's often done so that the screen can be offset from center without you noticing. If you've ever seen an iPhone--the logo is on the back on purpose. With AGENT, we've currently put the logos on the back. So that you can experience the UI, not feel like there's a phone strapped to your wrist. If you _really_ miss the logo, we could help you print out tiny cut-out AGENT letters to stick on the front :) I'm teasing of course, although personalization can be fun. @Brad Billman -- that's probably where one of the millions of .NET developers will step in and create a cool app for that. We'll be providing a preview SDK and emulator in a month...so people can start working on these. With AGENT, apps can be powerful. @Dredon -- that wasn't an option at $100,000 -- but now that we've passed the funding goal we are able to test and evaluate several different high-clarity lens materials :) Thank you for your support! BTW--different types of "glass" have different RF properties, clarity properties, reflective properties, etc. We love sapphire, gorilla glass, and mineral glass all--sometimes for different reasons. @Brad Billman -- route tracking? Can you please explain what you're looking for a bit more? If you're talking about route planning for exercise...that's something you'd probably want your smartphone to do. Or a well-crafted watch app. @Brad Billman -- we will be testing pre-production AGENT watches in the real world, and we will probably solicit some of the most active community members from the early-backer tiers to help out. It would require a time commitment on their part though, as it would be real testing and not "getting a watch early". They might also need to be in the NYC area, so they could check in. TBD. @Brad Billman - we'd love to deliver early, but I don't want to start promising _early_ delivery :) FCC, Qi, CE testing all take a while (as shown in our estimated schedule) and we want to make sure we do it right. Thank you for backing us! @Paul Shabian -- AGENT is a very different kind of watch. It's a premium designer watch with really amazing electronics inside. It also has a full-blown managed code runtime which makes apps trustable, amazing battery life, a high-clarity screen, real glass lens, wireless charging, ability to run powerful watch apps, world-class developer tools, windows phone compatibility, etc. We're excited that there are different smartwatch offerings out there. Choice is a fantastic thing. We chose the longer-to-market "no compromises" route. We'd love you to join us on this journey. @Jared Simpson -- I knew I shouldn't have let him wear the white prototype watch at the party. :) @cheeloon lim -- that might need to be something built into the core OS. But you could technically create an app launcher of sorts for sub-apps. That does sound like a cool idea; I'd love to see how that worked physically. @suddep raju -- let me answer each of your questions. 1. We will do repairs at our USA-based facility. If you need to replace the battery, there should be people with skills in every country who can do that for you. 2. For Blackberry -- we would love to find a way to support this, although it might be partial support rather than full support. Blackberry 10 uses some standard Bluetooth profiles and in theory supports an Android app. So it might just work. We really don't know, and we can't promise anything for Blackberry quite yet. We're super-focused on delivering watches and software for iPhone, Android, and Windows Phone--but we'll certainly take a look and see if we can just "plug in". 3. The watches are unisex. We're super-focused on delivering this smartwatch to our backers, so there's not a different "ladies" version in the works at this time. But many of the ladies who have seen this one in person seem to approve of its looks on their wrist :) @Dylan Dwyer -- buttons are not clicky, but they're not lazy squishy either. Not sure what to call them, other than "good buttons". BTW in watch parlance they're "pushers"; if you see me using that word...think "buttons". We've designed the home screen experience so that it's not terribly easy to do something drastic by accidentally pushing buttons. Up/down switches watch faces, select gets rid of notifications. If there's an issue with backers getting odd behavior because of pressing buttons accidentally...we can certainly look into providing hooks for a "screen lock". Maybe just run a combination lock game as a watchface :) @Nick Landry--you can store apps and data. It's not a hard drive, so you don't have a ton of space. But you can store your images, some data, etc. Some apps will be big, some small. You can of course also shuttle data to/from your phone in connected apps. @Dylan Dwyer -- right now, apps will need to specify how much room they want. we may be able to make that dynamic in the future, but for a good user experience fixed is much simpler to understand and predict as a user. Automatic syncing of preferences, even when the app isn't open...now that's a cool idea too. @Chris Guillen -- Windows Phone 8 is a first-class smartphone citizen in our world. Thank you for backing us! @Dylan Dwyer -- another great question, thanks for supporting us! AGENT will absolutely allow side-loading of arbitrary apps. That's in our ethos as a company. We're also working on a watch app store concept. Free apps are definitely a go. For paid apps, we have a way to do that through a store for USA-based developers, and we're working on options for international developers. Since apps are trustable, more backers and more funds could let us ramp up a store into a self-governing community. We'll share more via updates as the project continues. @Ryan Heyser -- if WP gets an 8.1, and it supports BTLE -- oh yes, we'll support it ;) As to extended goals...we didn't compromise when we designed the product, but we have some ideas :) We may do things a little differently than the normal stretch goals, to maximize value to backers. More on that soon. @Chooi -- two requests for yellow straps? Wow. Ping me when the color survey goes out, and I'll see if we can swap you for a yellow one :) We will have extra straps available when or shortly after the watches ship. No way to add those to the Kickstarter rewards though. As far as notification center goes...interesting idea. Apps are pretty powerful, but in version 1.0 we're trying to keep apps to "foreground" or "unloaded". There's some potential to enable some other scenarios though. Let's discuss this when we get closer to launch. Could be a cool hack. Chris @Nick Landry -- so House of Horology has a yellow stitched wristband today. I bet if we really tried...we could get one on your watch :) When the survey comes around for color picking--ask and I'll see if we can swap. <url>"replaceable". 3. Sapphire is a cool material, but it's also an aluminum oxide. Which means that RF performance might suffer if we switched from mineral glass. It's also really expensive. We are testing it, but that's all I can commit to at the moment. With the extra funding, there are a lot of cool things we're looking at doing for our backers. Some you may never notice because they're simply an upgrade in packaging or a few months of someone's time to write extra tutorials. Some might have to be backer-exclusives. But if we can do things which are visible upgrades without affecting the FCC/CE/Qi test cycle...that would be really awesome :) @Alper -- we'll do our best to make you proud. We're off to the races, and will be heads-down all year working to get an AGENT watch onto your wrist. @John McLoughlin -- an AGENT hack day in the UK would be awesome. How's the weather in December? @sgllama -- yes, AGENT will be able to talk directly to BLE devices (sensors, etc.) @Stefan Daugaard Poulsen -- we'll release a preview of the SDK and emulator at the end of the Kickstarter campaign. You'll be able to start developing apps within the month, and you'll be able to power-tune your apps when you get hardware (with the power measuring chip inside). @Sebastian Fruhauf -- the link that Erik just provided is the one! [Thanks Eric!] The display is quite reflective and looks even better in direct sunlight than in the shade. And in the dark, it'll catch some light. And if it doesn't have enough light to reflect...the backlight will take care of you. And yes, yes, absolutely--the display stays on 100% of the time. That was very important to us, since seeing what time it is without having to "activate" a watch should be its most basic feature. Chris @Yoon Kim -- the wireless charger for the Palm Pre is not a Qi (standards-based) charger. So it unfortunately won't work. It will however look fantastic on your desk, and keep your watch company. Those chargers were cool! @Robert Holbert -- yes, you will definitely be able to manage apps from the phone. As far as apps go--50 is a lot! But there are creative ways around that as well. We're mostly trying to make things...simple. @CK -- the watch comes with time (and we'll have a timer, stopwatch, and vibrating alarm app) and a music app--and the phone lost alert and notification features (including caller id). Plus a few default watch faces. Everything else is installable, so that you don't use up space for apps you don't want. We'll have sample apps that you can build and install as a dev--and a few finished apps like weather and as well. I have a feeling that our community of developers is going to beat us to quite a few of those. You tell us what you'd like to see :) As the pledge amount exceeds the minimum goal, we will have budget to build more apps and more tutorials--so the catalog will just continue to grow. BTW, each app takes up a certain # of blocks. Simpler apps can be as small as one block. The watch has approximately 50 blocks of flash for apps. And because apps are managed code, their IL code is surprisingly compact :) @Dung Ngyuen -- we'd love to take more videos (not commercially produced). Tutorials, interviews, we love that sort of stuff. We're also going to be at a few events here in NYC with watches--so if you're local we'd love to show you how to write an app in person! That's good feedback on writing updates showing more details so it doesn't get lost. Let me chat with our industrial designer and see if we can export some non-render CAD drawings for illustrations. @CK -- I almost forgot. If you hold the top-right and bottom-left buttons for about ten seconds, the watch will reboot. That's a fail-safe, in case an app ever went wrong. And if you hold down the middle button on the right while booting, it goes into recovery mode. That's all wired in hardware and controlled by the second processor. There are a lot of little details that you'll probably never know exist or need to know exist--but they're there to back you up. @CK -- the three buttons on the rights are user buttons. Generally speaking they're "up", "select" and "down". In an app with specific feature requirements, like the exercise app, the middle-right button is generally still "play/pause/select" while the developer can do whatever they'd like with the others. On the left side, the bottom-left button will switch between apps (and if you have enough apps loaded...will bring up a menu). The top-left is a dedicated backlight button, and the backlight continues to stay on while you're interacting with the watch. BTW, we do have an accelerometer that detects taps and shakes and all that jazz--so it is technically possible to activate the backlight that way. But we believe that backlight is something that really needs its own button, at an easy-to-find-in-the-dark place. Finally--all buttons are software buttons. So technically if someone really wants to hack things, they could probably find a way to use those two left buttons too. But we're going to recommend against that, unless you're creating something truly custom for yourself. @Mikael Dúi Bolinder - from Chris -- I grew up in Idaho, where it gets that cold. I understand :) We are using industrial-temp parts wherever available for the watch. The biggest limitation is the battery; they don't exactly love the freezing cold temperatures. The screen may also get grumpy at extreme cold temperatures. We can work up an official tech spec over the course of the campaign if you're super-concerned about the super-cold. I will be wearing mine everywhere, snow and cold are just life sometimes :) @Ryan Lee--from Chris -- I'm away from the official specs but I have a measuring tape and a prototype aluminum watch with me. We should add a drawing and dimensions to the main page with more exact figures, but for the moment: roughly 38mm top-to-bottom on the front face, 35mm left-to-right on the front face, and around 12mm in depth. The watch lugs add a bit to that near the base, snuggling your wrist, where they attach to the 22mm strap. You can get a feel for how the size looks in the video, both on the gentleman and female runner in the first 1:30 and on me at the end. I absolutely love the size: sufficient-enough size to be useful and easy to work with, but small enough that you're not wearing a "computer" on your wrist. @arnoud de jong -- for incoming calls, Windows Phone supports the standard hands-free profile (the same profile which shows caller ID in your car). Many phones also support the phone book profile--and we can also sync contacts in the background if necessary :) Music control is a similar story--using the AVRCP (AV remote control profile). Notifications work a bit differently on WP8; there's no MAP profile and phones like my Lumia 920 tend to want to read texts aloud instead. We've pinged the folks on the Windows Phone team to see how we can make the integration experience top-notch, and we'll be focusing on providing the options which are available to us and you--and will continue tweaking and refining going forward as well. Developers can extend that even further. We're talking about apps today--but the Agent OS platform (including NETMF) is designed to support other advanced scenarios in the future. But that's a conversation for another time; today we're focused on getting these things off the assembly line and onto your wrist. @Greg -- regarding date formatting...that's a great idea. We'd love to support Endomondo. We'll be reaching out to some of the popular smartphone app makers. If you would reach out to them too an express your interest in using AGENT with their app that will help too! Thanks for supporting us! @Jason--absolutely, will do. While there are technical realities that limit our choices of materials (i.e. we can't make it out of iron), we are working with several premium materials to create a beautiful matte case. A smart watch should look smart too. @Surur -- great ideas for apps! Please take video! :) @Dino -- that's great feedback, thank you. We're limiting our delivery tiers to help ensure on-time delivery, and we're very cognizant about good communication. We can't promise to answer every e-mail within minutes, but we'll try to get back to you the same day. And if this thing really really takes off, we'll hire a few friends and make sure we take good care of you. If we ever fail at that, let us know and we'll work through it together. So glad to have you along on the journey. Thank you for your support! @Winnafred -- from Chris -- we're really not in a position to understand or comment on other company's products or processes, but let me throw a few thoughts out there. First of all, I are really grateful for the smartwatches that are out there already. Unknown obstacles happen to every company, and the optimist in me likes to believe that everyone is doing their best. Beyond that... AGENT started out as an idea in 2011. We wanted to make sure we got the core technology down and had a premium product ready before we launched on Kickstarter. We have a lot of happy customers and we know that a lot of them will back us here...and we don't want to let you down. Our focus for the watch design is very different than other smartwatches. In a nutshell, we engineered AGENT from the ground up for software developers and apps. The battery infrastructure, the power management, the ridiculous attention to every microamp -- plus the powerful managed code runtimes and developer tool story...well, it's all there so that we can have amazing apps. Because apps and features make the smart watch "smart". Because we're using brand-new technology, and because we're adding a lot of tech (like hardware power metering and wireless charging and ultra-efficient power management) -- and because it's a designer watch -- the AGENT Smartwatch is a bit more expensive than others. The advantage you get here is that our Kickstarter price is the same as the full retail price you mention...so by backing the project and believing in us, you're also getting a watch for the same price as a more traditional smartwatch offering. On your specific concerns: on delays, we have tried to be extraordinarily open about the "getting to market" story at the bottom of our project's home page. Sometimes your FCC prescanning goes great but you run into snags. Sometimes a critical supplier is late. Things happen. We've been building electronics in volume for years, and we'd be lying if we said that manufacturing is a perfect art. But we also understand it well, and House of Horology is great at making watches (such as their $490 Bedlam watches). So we move forward, and we make things happens. On battery defects, we are buying batteries from a major supplier. And the watch is repairable and the battery can be replaced. You're also getting a two year warranty on the watch which generally covers the battery as well. On watches getting updated...our goal is to deliver a strong user experience and amazing developer platform. We'll add apps and features over time, but hopefully there's not a need for a lot of fast updates. And if there is--which is always possible--our fail-safes ensure that an update can't brick your watch. Does that help? Kickstarter is a very open place, and we want to be upfront with you. We are taking this journey together. We expect that it will be an awesome one, and we're so glad to have you come along with us and support us. Thank you! @Kenneth Salomon -- we don't have an answer on multiple simultaneous devices yet. There are some battery concerns. Also--we do have the ability to talk to multiple devices at the same time, but there are some specific app scenarios where it would be good to use both instances for a single smartphone. Can you ask us that again a little later in the process--and we'll have some better numbers to work off? The hardware in the watch has some pretty amazing flexibility; we just need to make sure we provide a great user experience first and foremost. @Welshman -- We're using glass for our watch lens. No glass is completely scratch-proof, but it's a much nicer material than plastic for watch lenses (with the exception, maybe, of some bulletproof polycarbonates etc.). Glass also looks pretty. We are looking into coatings which may add additional scratch resistance, but we also want to make sure that the lens maintains its beautiful high clarity with the screen. We can share some of those tests with our backers if you'd like; we really love that we can share the process with all of you. @Andre Koschyk -- we are aware of the conformity requirements for German customs, and have already begun working to make sure that our CE certifications and part numbers and customs info all line up properly--and that we include the proper documentation in the box. We have had a number of German backers reach out to us and offer to help make sure that everything goes smoothly. We really, really appreciate it! You all are the best! @Tony Leung -- we don't have any reward tiers with multiple Qi chargers. If you need an extra one, e-mail us and we'll help you locate an extra one. @Imo Imo -- we don't have specific battery consumption figures for Windows Phone batteries using SPP, but generally Bluetooth is reasonably power-efficient on phones. It'll largely depend on what app you're using and how much data it's transferring. As the phone world moves towards Bluetooth LE and apps use smaller less frequent packets for power efficiency (which will show up in the power metering on AGENT too), your battery life may get even better :) @sudeep raju -- Blackberry isn't on our official list, but it's something we'd love to support someday. And since we're using standards (including Bluetooth SPP) you could probably write BlackBerry apps with AGENT support on day one. Music control and caller ID may work out of the box too. We just don't want to promise anything for additional smartphone platforms right at the start. We're super-focused on delivering AGENT. If we go way over on pledges, this may be something we can bring in extra resources to address (perhaps via an Android compatibility app) to extend some Blackberry love :) Just FYI: you can follow us on Twitter @agentwatches -- we'll start retweeting some of your tweets soon! @Paul Shabian -- we limited the first batch of deliveries to 4,200 units. We can make about 1,000 watches a week in the USA. If and when the December tier fills up, we can add a January tier. We definitely want to build a big community; we just want to make sure we don't set an expectation that we can deliver 25,000 watches on day one. So no worries, we'll make more :) @James Abbott -- great questions. These questions are really helping us put together the best questions to answer in the FAQ section. If you want to see a sample Agent app, check out the screenshot at agentwatches.com. It's a bit blurry--but that is a fun "draw lots of random lines/rectangles" app that we were playing with recently. Communicating with your phone is as easy as create a SerialPort object and using .Write and .Read calls. If you're written C# code before, you're at home. And for developers who want to just use the smartwatch as a remote display...we're putting together an official remote language for getting button presses and sensor data--and drawing using the integrated Bitmap drawing class. Does that answer your question well? We'll start working up some tutorials, but I want to make sure we get all the questions answered first. @Stephen Nguyen -- We'll be publishing the first version of the SDK with the emulator, maybe a bit sooner. It seems like you awesome folks are really aching to start on apps! If you want to get a feel for writing native watch apps (i.e. not using it as a remote display), check out some of the projects that Netduino users have created. AGENT is a lot different than Netduino, but you can share code between them. Also--AGENT apps on production watches run in AppDomains, so we have a good developer experience around that which doesn't really apply to Netduino. As far as iOS goes, from our experience iOS lets apps talk to accessories using Bluetooth LE. Apple can change their rules at any time, but there are quite a few apps which talk to accessories today. MFI devices which use SPP...those require special interprocess comm, whitelisting, etc. We avoid that wherever possible. We want you to have the freedom to create. @Fernando -- lots of questions, let's get them all answered for you. For iPhone 5, we're using a dual-mode radio. So apps will talk via Bluetooth LE to the watch (GATT). This includes sending notifications to the watch. 1. iPhone does support text messages and other notifications via MAP and such. We'll do our best to provide a premium experience--and for features where iPhone doesn't shine as brightly as Android or Windows Phone, we'll try to provide you some "power tools" so that you can get the most out of your hardware while we work with Apple to enhance the smartwatch-smartphone integration experience. 2. When you reach 10% battery, the watch will actually change into low-power (watchface-only) mode for you, giving you a few extra days of timekeeping. It's certainly possible to extend this functionality further with 20% notifications, etc. We'll keep refining the user experience based on backer feedback during and after the campaign. 3. House of Horology does a great job at waterproofing watches. We won't know the exact ATM until we have production units in hand to test, but you will be able to immerse it with water. There are a lot of factors that go into what "3 ATM" or "5 ATM" or "10 ATM" really means though, just to set good expectations. We wouldn't necessarily recommend swimming with and pushing buttons on a 5 ATM watch, in a hot tub, for instace :) 4. The accelerometer is 3-axis and can certainly work as a pedometer. All you need is an app to pull that data up to the Internet. This is an important capability that we made sure was baked in. 5. We build a lot of hardware at Secret Labs. We've already sorted out the circuitry, and we're really hoping to hit our estimated ship dates. We're also making it in the USA which helps get things done quickly and done well. We will be heads-down for the rest of the year making this happen for you, and will let you know if we run into unexpected delays. 6. The watch strap does not contain metal. You will be able to get additional straps for your watch (or swap in any 22mm strap), but there are no rewards with that built-in. If you have specific needs, just send us a message and we'll do what we can to help. Does that answer your questions well? Thank you for your support! Chris Secret Labs @BAN -- the watch is water tight and charges wirelessly. The charger is pretty small though, and powered by MicroUSB--so if you want to carry it with you it'll tuck away nicely. One of the big benefits of having the amazing power architecture is that you don't really need to sweat the charging thing. Just charge it when it's convenient. If you forget and you get down to low power, it'll automatically switch into watchface-only mode for you and give you a few extra days of timekeeping. @Ken McAndrew -- we should probably let the smarthphone app developers have the glory, announcing support as they get it ready. Luckily with the emulator...they'll be able to start adding support for AGENT in their smartphone apps. We're really excited about all the maker-style applications for this watch too. Interact with robots, use your watch as a game controller, do fun artistic projects...the sky is the limit. And the tools are there to support your creativity as a developer. @Nick salch -- the 3rd-party developer experience for AGENT is pretty awesome. If you have favorite golf apps on your smartphone today, please reach out to them and ask them to support AGENT! With our Netduino open-source hardware, we work with 10,000s of developers to help them create cool electronics. We're here to help smartphone and smartwatch app developers do the same with this new platform as well. @Surur -- I have good news there...Windows Phone 8 *does* support Bluetooth for apps. To confirm: we're using Bluetooth SPP (via RFCOMM) with WP8 and AGENT today. We did lots of testing with a Lumia 920. Several WP8 apps--such as the Sphero ball control apps--use Bluetooth this way on WP8 today. Here's a link to Microsoft documentation on Bluetooth support for apps with Windows Phone 8. <url>"secondary display" feature to their smartphone apps rather than creating a rich companion watch app. @Paul Shabian -- the Qi charger we're offering for the AGENT smartwatch uses the newer v1.1 standard (which enables MicroUSB power to the charging base). Qi chargers range from $30-$60, and we wanted to make sure we offered a high quality one with the watch. Any compliant charger that you already have should work though--and you can always wait until you get the watch to pick one up. Qi is a standard--and standards are awesome. NY -- thanks for the feedback! There's a lot of really exciting new tech in this watch, but we understand that "wow" comes from the kinds of apps that are enabled by that technology. With help from some amazing technology providers, we've built an amazing watch platform; now we're here to help developers make it fulfill your dreams :) We'll be holding some events here in NYC; hopefully you can come say hi and we can meet and talk about watches and the new technology in person! Maxime Marical--the great thing about AGENT is that it comes with amazing developer tools. A company like Facebook can add support into their app (either using the watch as a display...or talking to a custom app on the watch). Or third party developers can create an app to enable those types of scenarios. The platform is really powerful. Millions of software developers basically already know how to write code for AGENT. We can't wait to see what you all build! CK -- from what we've seen, different Qi chargers can deliver power at different rates. For instance, MicroUSB chargers (enabled by Qi v1.1) can pull less power from your USB port than a higher-voltage wall-powered Qi charger. The good news is that the battery in AGENT is tiny because watches aren't big :) So charging time for a small battery on a Qi charger is pretty quick, regardless of the charger. If you're looking to charge something big like a tablet, you'd probably want a Qi charger powered from an outlet instead.
