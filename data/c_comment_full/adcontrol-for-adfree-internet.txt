@Tal J Moskowitz the device works with iGuardian for sure and to open the model file you need 123D designer program or other 3D designer program. @Martin Firsching what is your exact question ? @ripoche its working from any usb without any problem dont worry ! @Richard C the amount of money alone would not be a big problem to hold up a server for about 5 years alone and considering that the sales will probably continue after the product is released it is not a problem at all but we have other investors off kickstarter in this project @poz sorry but we are under heavy load of interest we are right now talking with potential investors thats why it takes some time to respond, the device becomes the gateway for your router or modem, the autoupdate is from our servers and its set on from the factory so people who are not into tech that much dont have to worry about it. it can be turned off and it updates just the DNS list and all the blocked DNS are sent to localhost which means there is no way to redirect traffic to "our servers". the update cant rewrite your device settings adcontrol will be auto-updated always from our servers with the new configuration to keep up against ads. @Max Zurlino <url>
