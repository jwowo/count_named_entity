Hey Sharisse, we've been working on ways to incorporate labeling and what it would cost to do so and we're just not there with our price point this time. We'd love to add a few more specs to the Cable Keeper, but keeping the design simple makes for cost effective smaller production runs. We know it's not pretty, but for DIY labeling you can always do the old scotch trick. You guys are right on. We've seriously considered adding labeling above each row. Would this be a good stretch goal? We'd be interested to hear if others are wanting labeling too. If so we can figure out a stretch goal we'd need to hit to make this added cost viable!
