Are you saying that your BOLT2 is interfering with with your radio? That doesn't sound like an issue with BOLT2. Can you send us an email at <email> so we can help diagnose what you're seeing? @Alireza, the pouch does fit our short cables :) <url>’t want to disconnect and reconnect the cable then you can manually start charging. Also some cables without a metal tip aren’t recognized for automatic charging. @Eric, just replied to your email. Anyone else with questions or concerns please email us at <email> and we'll take care of you right away. @Juliet, we can definitely help you (and anyone else) out. Just send us an email at <email> and we'll take care of you right away. Hi All, anyone experiencing any issue or have any questions please email us at <email> and we'll take care of it right away! @ Andrew, everything should be automatic charging, but send us an email at <email> and we'll get everything figured out. @Nathan, we haven't ran into that problem but send us an email at <email> and we'll see if we can figure it out. @heyyceejayy, While charging your BOLT2 on the wall all 4 blue LEDs will be solid when your BOLT2 is completely charged. For your s6 edge you should expect to get just under 2 full charges. If you have any additional questions please feel free to email us at <email>. @N, This time around the cables were not included but were available as add on's in backerkit but you can also still get them on our site: <url>² and a short cable. Unfortunately the pouch color will only be available in one color but it'll be a lighter color (not black like the sample image). @Kurtis, yes absolutely. At the end of the campaign, there will options for you to add on certain items, including the international travel kit (US to UK, EU and AUS adapters). @ Armando, don't worry, that was just a basic sample. The final pouch will be much better. @Frank, Right now there will only be support for the US plug type, but because BOLT2 works with 100-240v outlets you can just use a simple a plug adapter. Let us know if you have any other questions. @Gavin, yes to get three units just triple your pledge. Let us know if you have any other questions and thanks for the support! @Lawrence, Sounds good, thanks for the support! @Michael, yes that's correct. @Nolan, You're correct. Ultimately for us it comes down to size, capacity, and cost. Battery technology is definitely something that hasn't made huge advancements in recent years, so we picked the best balance of those three attributes. Let us know if you have any other questions. @Lawrence, Charging BOLT2 from empty can take roughly 6 hours. In terms of charge cycles, the batteries are rated at 500 cycles before a noticeable loss in capacity. In terms of standby, BOLT2 isn't meant to be left in a bag for months on end. We'd estimate on the order of a couples weeks before you notice a loss in charge. Let us know if you have any other questions and thanks for the support! @Nolan, the LEDs are pretty straight forward. The bottom green LED will be solid to indicate charging, and the four blue LEDs will show battery capacity in 25% increments. When you plug BOLT2 into the wall it will do a startup animation lighting up all of the LEDs in order and then it will show the current charge level. With BOLT unplugged, you can quickly see how much charge is remaining by pressing the button. Let us know if you have any other questions. @Jeremy, That's correct. BOLT2 has automatic current distribution. For example, If you have one iPad charging with BOLT2 it will pull up to 2.4A. If you decide to add a second iPad to charge, then the current will be automatically balanced between the two devices where they will receive about 1.2A each. Hopefully that answers your question. Let us know if you have any other questions. @Marc, That's correct BOLT2 puts out 2.4A shared, so it can hit 2.4A on one port if needed. Thank you for the feedback. Let us know if you have any other questions. @James, The product you've mentioned is literally twice as big as BOLT2, only has an output of 2.1A (compared to BOLT2's 2.4A), it's more expensive, and isn't very attractive. It looks like you've made the right choice in supporting our project! Let us know if you have any other questions. @Steven, Great suggestion. It may be hard to see in the images but we actually did in fact smooth out the edges and corners so they are not as sharp this time. @Joseph, Thank you, we greatly appreciate it! @Trevor, That's unfortunate, but we're glad that you're onboard for BOLT2! @Marcello, We did think about this during design. It sounds counterintuitive, but building a universal plug port would actually take up more space overall once the US plug is mounted. By using a simple plug adapter it's essentially the same as removable plugs, but it keeps the design more streamlined. In addition to saving space, this also greatly reduced our production costs and allowed BOLT2 to be more affordable. Let us know if you have any other questions. @Kim, BOLT2 is only designed to charge from an A/C outlet. We would have liked to have added alternate methods to charge BOLT2, but it would complicate the circuit, add extra bulk, and add extra cost. For those reasons we decided to stick to A/C charging only. You could, however, charge your BOLT in car with a power inverter. Let us know if you have any other questions. @Paul, yeah unfortunately using an adapter is the only option right now. @ Lukasz, Yes, you use a standard US to EU adapter for the European outlet. BOLT2 supports 100-240v outlets. @I3igcircle, yes we'll be using USPS to ship to Canada :) @ Michael, Awesome, thanks for the support and tip! We're going to send them a message now. Hopefully they'll give us a shot. @Ko, If BOLT2 is plugged into the wall it will always give full priority to charging the devices that are connected before charging itself. It does not charge both simultaneously because this would slow down the charging of both itself and the connected device. Thanks for backing! @SomethingSketchy, Great to hear that your original BOLT is still getting some use! Adding an additional USB port was definitely high on our list. The same thing happens to us when someone else forgets to bring their BOLT. We would have liked to have added alternate methods to charge BOLT2, but it would complicate the circuit, add extra bulk, and add extra cost. For those reasons we decided to stick to A/C charging only. You could, however, charge your BOLT in car with a power inverter. Let us know if you have any other questions. @Peter, Glad to hear you're still using your original BOLT! These new shirts are even better than our first set. @Alex, No problem. We have a few ideas in mind. Stay tuned for the announcement. @Paul, We do offer international plug adapter kits on our website as well as cables. Currently we do not have plans to include a charging cable with BOLT2. Let us know if you have any other questions. @Marco, BOLT2 only supports the US plug at this time, but you can use a standard plug adapter and it will work internationally. @Alex, BOLT2 does not use quick charge 2.0. By faster charging we are comparing the output rate of standard USB (500ma) to BOLT2 which has 2.4A output. This will provide a maximum charge rate that's over 4 times faster than standard USB. Let us know if you have any other questions. @Shahriar, BOLT2 acts both as a regular wall charger and battery backup. While BOLT2 is plugged into the wall it will bypass the battery conserving its life. Priority is given to the devices attached first and then BOLT2 will take care of charging itself. All of this is handled automatically without the need for a manual switch. I hope that answered your question, but feel free to follow up. @Francisco, BOLT2 has automatic current distribution. This means that it if one device is plugged in it can pull up to 2.4A from either port. If you decide that you want to plug in another device then it will automatically balance the current so both devices take what they need (up to a total of 2.4A). Let us know if you have any other questions. @Kelly, BOLT2 will give an iPhone 6 about two full charges and it will charge faster than the charger that came with the iPhone. Let us know if you have any other questions. @Lance, yes that's correct. @Juan, BOLT is designed only to be charged with the A/C prongs. @Senad, You can order more by multiplying your pledge amount. If you are an international backer then you only need to pay for international shipping once. Let us know if you have any other questions. @Jeff, for A/C input it's at 0.15A, so you're looking at around 6 hours to fully charge an empty BOLT2 on the wall. @Jeff, 100-240V A/C (Globally Supported) @Briahna, That would be nice, but unfortunately our factory minimums per color are pretty high. Depending on the funding level that we reach it could be a possibility. Thanks for reaching out and let us know if you have any other questions. @Chris, yes you can:) Just change your pledge amount in the increments of how many you want (dependent in the reward level). @Peter and @David, Thanks for the support! We're really excited about BOLT2 @David, At this time we are not including any cables with BOLT2, but they are currently available for purchase on our website: <url>
