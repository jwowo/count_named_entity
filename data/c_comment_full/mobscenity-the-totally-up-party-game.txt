Thought the blank decks had all been accounted for. I will fix the issue immediately! Hi, For those of you who have played the game, post how it went! Fred Hi, Blasts are justly deserved. I did comments to stop posting until had news on shipping. 30 packages went out this morning and another 30 to 50 to go out tomorrow morning. All sent via priority mail. I have certainly made mistakes along the way and will keep trying to learn from them. Thank you for support and patience. We fully expect to have games out before the end of the summer! Hi, Unfortunately, the we will not make the May ETA. In order to make sure you all get the best quality decks, AdMagic (the same company used by Cards Against Humanity) is manufacturing the cards. We have reviewed all the proofs and and will post updates as we get closer to receiving the final manufactured decks - They will look great. The whole process has been harder than we expected, and we are thankful we have a partner like AdMagic to guide us through the process. We apologize for the delays and appreciate your patience. Fred We apologize for the confusing message. If you pledge at the $15 reward tier, you will get two copies of the final basic game deck (108 cards in each deck). Thank you for making this happen! We can't wait to get you all the game so you can start playing. Thank you for your comment, Michael! Here is a reddit link: <url>
