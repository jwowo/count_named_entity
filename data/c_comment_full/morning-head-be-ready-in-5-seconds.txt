Thanks John! The retail price will be similar to the backing rewards. We will likely offer a monthly program as well. Haven't looking into Amazon as of yet. Great ideas. Thanks again! Hi S. Todd, at month's end we will have a fully operational website where you will be able to purchase at www.morninghead.com. When the kickstarter campaign is complete on Feb 23, we will send out a message requesting shipping information. The morninghead caps will ship out soon thereafter. Thanks for your support - kickstarter's an awesome website, welcome! Stefan, while we can't give an extra cap, we will be expressing our sincere gratitude in other ways when the shipments go out. Thanks again! :) Thanks everyone for the supportive comments! The morninghead caps will be shipping at the end of the month. We will be collecting shipping data after the project is completed on Feb 23rd. Thanks again to all! (Brice, thanks for weighing in. We'd love for you to up your pledge so you may one day experience the bliss that is morning head. There's no better feeling.) Hi Mark, Visit the project page and click “Manage Your Pledge.” Enter a new amount in the pledge amount box. Note that you are not adding to your existing pledge; the amount you enter will be the total amount collected if the project is successfully funded. Let me know if that works for you (you can send a private message). Thanks so much for your support!
