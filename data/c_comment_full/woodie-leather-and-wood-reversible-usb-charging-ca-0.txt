@Chun, thank you for the nice words. Beginning of October is our estimated delivery date - thank you and have a great day! @Connor ; 1. Yes most likely, but need to confirm with team (reg. BackerKit), 2. Yes, you can adjust your pledge, no problem. @Tim, thank you for the hint and suggestion. We need to review what the demand will be and then decide based on LOE vs ROI. DANKE Christina, great idea! Thanks for sharing! Simon, thank you for the suggestions! At the moment we are going to offer lightning only due to our manufacturer's MOQs. But keep an eye open, if the campaign is very successful we might consider. :) Thank you, good to be back! :) Yes, except for the 24 hour super early bird, just double the pledge amount to get two, triple to get three… no need to pay for shipping more than once! If you have selected the super early, add €14 for each additional 20cm unit. Hope this helps, we'll make a graphic to make it easier to understand :)
