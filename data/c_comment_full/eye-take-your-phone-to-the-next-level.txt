Dear bakers, We are fully aware and understand your concern about the project progress,the lack of information and the response time for comments/questions. We are sorry for that and work hard to improve it as soon as possible. We hired a new experienced guy to be responsible on bakers & customers communication. In the coming days we will upload a project details status. Thank you for your understanding and patient. Regards, ESTI team Hi everyone! We didn't launch any other website excluding Indiegogo. Please provide a link and we'll try to shut down this website. Our TOTAL funding (KS+IG) until now is $600K (after fees...) We're using those funds VERY CAREFULLY for bringing the Eye Smartcase to life without compromising on the quality and time table. Please be assure that your funds are in good hands and used for the project success and ONLY for the project success. Hi everyone! Thank you @kenneth for posting this comment, this page is a scam! I'll do my best to remove it, I don't know how and don't know if I have time for it but I'll do my best. About the update: I don't have something new to notify so I don't see a reason to post an update just for posting an update and without any new info. As soon as we'll have some news regarding to the progress I'll post an update. Right now things are going fine. "We'll sent an OTA eventually, but the shipping will be with Android Marshmallow." Oh, I'm sorry! It's Android Nougat 7.1 ! It was a mistake. So sorry for that! @jameszhang "is it possible to upgrade to Android O? so many great features....." We'll sent an OTA eventually, but the shipping will be with Android Marshmallow. Hi! Sure no problem! We'll post an update very soon (next few days)! Hi everyone!! We're working very hard on both customer support you and making the Eye Smartcase ready for production asap. As mentioned here, for any private inquiry, please send a private message. I've seen here some question that has been repeated about splitting shipments when ordering more than one Eye Smartcase- one for the current iPhones at the end of August and the other for the next ones. Unfortunately, we technically don't have an option on our ordering system for splitting the same order to two shipments. We're trying to find a solution for this and if we'll find we'll mention it on the next update. Hi guys!!! Please be patient as we're processing all the surveys and answering all of your private messages. We've got the funds from KS only two days ago and we'll probably hire a person especially for answering all of your inquiries and messages in only few hours. Please try to understand us. We're truly sorry for this inconvenience. @Lee Wing Fatt "How do I know I'm confirmed for the 64GB upgrade?" I've checked your pledge and you are confirmed. You should receive the survey today and see this by yourself. @Samuel Edyson "Hi, I backed this project for the sole purpose that it can bring "wireless charging" to iPhone, it's a wishlist since so many version of iphones. Now I wonder if as a creator of this product, would you know which wireless charging base product that I can buy to put in my home. I don't want to end up buying wireless charging base that can't be used to charge the eye case. Hope to hear from you soon and thank you in advance! Cheers..." Hi! We support the qi wireless charging standard which is the most used one. Almost any wireless charger today is qi. You can also choose a dedicated wireless charger in the survey that we'll send you. @Lance "When do we get to choose the iPhone we have? I have the regular iPhone 7" You'll soon receive an email with a link to the survey. @war3rd "I wonder if they have any intent of upgrading the GPU prior to release? The stock GPU is very slow so any game that requires graphic horsepower won't run well on the device. I'd pay extra for a mid-range (or higher) GPU instead of the super low end one that it currently has." The GPU isn't slow, the drivers aren't complete yet and that's why it did bad in EAP video benchmark test. @Jasonbo4 ""Hi I wanted to know if I could play sounds from my iPhone without headphones when the case is on" Hi! Yes :) Ok, all the surveys are done and waiting for an approval of the company that sends them to you. Hi everybody! Sorry for this delay but we're working on the surveys. Please be patient as we want them to be the easiest possible for you to handle and for us to process. We hope to send them today! I'll be available to answer to all of your questions right after you get them. Hi everyone! First of all thank you for your amazing support!! We love you so much! We'll soon send an update to you with some details about what's next, and how to choose your model, color, address, add ons and so on. Early committed subscribers, we didn't forget you and our promise to you. Again, thank you so much everyone!!! The update with all the details is on its way :) @Dylan McConnell "Was there ever any word about the gpu being improved in the final product?" Sure! It's only drivers (software) problem and not a problem in the GPU. It'll be fixed. @Bhavik "Please don't make the lip higher because it will just ruin the experience. Can you also make a 5" tempered glass screen protector that is thick enough so that when it is placed on the EYE's screen, it feels and appears like there is no lip, but it is still protected?" We'll write it down but we don't commit to add this to the accessories. @jorge a flores ""why is it eye smart case dont support verizon" The chipset modem doesn't supports Verizon bands. @Tyrone Shaw Jr "1.Is it possible for you to provide videos of the functionality of the newest model including powerbank and footage of actual use including how the interenet browsing,text,and phone calls using the non 4g so we can see how it interacts with the iphone? 2.With the non 4g version if the main device ran off sprint would it still be able to uss its data for connectivity or is that feature only supported through Tmobile and AT&T? 1. The prototype we've shown in the campaign and on Unbox Therapy and on EverythingApplePro is our newest model. 2. Sure, iPhone SIM can be whatever you want and won't effect the Eye Smartcase features at all. @Billy Anderson "What happens after this is done will you have a website where you will sell these cases?" Probably. Of course all orders will cost more the KS rewards. @GoreGamer "Will there be a "lip" on the iphone side as to protect the iphone when placing the phone facedown on a surface? I was watching your Eye fully working unpainted prototype vid and it seems like there was no "lip" on the iphone side for protection." Right now it have a very very tiny lip. A lot of you asked to make it a little higher. We'll probably add to it in order to give even more protection to the iPhone screen. @Navpreet Gill "First of all good luck on your awesome vision and product. Awesome because your aim is to incorporate ultimate android functionality next to IOS. I made a pledge and have iPhone 7 plus. Eagerly waiting for this product. I went extra mile for 64gb version and realised, Will this have a bigger capacity battery?" Thank you!! All the models have the same battery size. @Herman Smestad-Samuelsen "Beacuse we are not going to get to 1mil you could maybe in the end survey get an option for the water profing for an extra pledge?" We'll see after the campaign end what we can do but probably not. @Bhavik "On the esti.me website, it says that the cases's charging port is "lightning for iOS and USB C for android". But aren't you saying that you're using a lightning port for the case? Please use USB C because it's the future and everyone wishes that apple would adopt USB C on the iPhone edition but they are still using lightning. It will be a major selling point if the EYE uses USB C!!!" Thanks for founding this. The "USB C for android" was left from a long time ago when we planned to make the Eye smartcase also to the S7 Edge, but we decided to focus on iPhones only. We'll fix the text on our website. @J Allen Hull "Will the 4G version support SIM cards from Straight Talk wireless?" Sorry but we don't know this company. Those are the bands supported: GSM: 850(B5)/900(B8)/1800(B3)/1900(B2) WCDMA: 850(B5)/900(B8)/1900(B2)/2100(B1) LTE FDD: 2100(B1)/1800(B3)/2600(B7)/800(B20) You should check with your carrier about the compatibility to those above. @Seong-Hyeon EOM "I'm add 24$ so, I can get 10000 battery right? 10$(ship) + 24$(battery) + 129$(4G) + 163$ right? I was make plan before." You're correct :) @Jimmy Shadow "How will you prevent accidental screen touches when I am using my iPhone? When the screen will face down then it'll be locked to touch. @Cedric Quey "Can i check for the sim cards slots. Are they 4g/3g dual standby? or when 1 of the sim slot is on 4g/3g. The other will become 2g? Singapore is no longer supporting 2g" When one sim is receiving 3G/4G the other can't get more than 2G.. @Nathan DeVille "Hey guys. Super excited about this case! I tried reading through the comments but couldn't find it. I plan to use this case on my work iPhone and want to put my personal Verizon SIM card in it. I know 4G will not be supported but will I still be able to call and text? Any help is appreciated. Thanks and congrats!" Hi! We're excited too!! Verison isn't supported also for text and calls. @Ron Manaog "I saw your video. Good job on starting your own software!. For my question, are we not be able to use videocall app or camera app on eye?. Ex. Camera 360 or Skype." Thank you! For now we aren't support it. @Matthew Deik "Will you show off the jet/matte white color before we have to choose? Also are the jet colors prone to scratches? Will the case interfere with cellular connectivity?" We don't have prototype in those colors. Yes, like any glossy finish. No, it won't interfere. @Dominique "I put in a pledge for the super early bird, which is all gone, for $129, can I add more to the pledge for 64gb on the phone, or will I lose my spot? Or, will I be able to add it once we get the survey to choose color, model, etc.?" You can add it to your current pledge. The 64GB option is open for all backers in all rewards. @Keita Inaba "So do we add 59 for 64 GB and 24 for the power bank?" Yes but only if you want them :) @Merle Walton "So I'm a little confused. If I set my iPhone 6s to Hotspot WIFI coverage can I connect the Eye via WIFI to my phone for connectivity?" Sure you can do it! But you don't have to because we'll deliver internet from the iPhone in much much less power demand than the WiFi hotspot. @Igal Kushnir "Hello I'm a backer , will I be able to choose iPhone 8 when available?" Hi! Thank you for backing us! You'll be able to choose to wait until the next iPhone model release and then decide whether you prefer the case for your current iPhone or wait another month and get one for the next new iPhone :) @Jenna "I'm also confused what cellular connectivity exactly is? As someone with verizon, what would the benefit be of getting a 4g over the regular? Thank you so much!" The benefit will be the ability to use cellular connectivity of other big US carriers, you can pop-in another 2 SIMs. @Jenna "Thanks for answering all of our questions. I read it doesn't support Verizon. I have purchased the 4g eye. Since I have Verizon would that mean I should just purchase the regular eye without cellular connectivity? I'm confused the difference." You don't have any restrictions about what carrier you're on in the iPhone. Now, about the Eye smartcase cellular connectivity in the US, you need to pop in the Eye's SIM slots a SIM card that's not Verizon's or Sprint. I hope things are clear now :) @DrLouies "@creator Hello,want to ask about the Eye apps if i download an Android app that need to use a camera like example ,will it use the iphone camera ?( and will the Eye will be able to use and get access to all the Iphone hardware? ) And the battery bank expansion (7200mah) will it add to the thickness of the Eye or it will be the same thickness ?" Hi! It wont use the iPhone camera. The Eye will use the iPhone's speakers and microphone. The powerbank will increase the the thickness by 2mm/0.07". @Tyler Pruce "@Creator- since this uses Android 7 is it able to utilize adoptable storage? So if it has the microSD card slot, can I use the microSD card as primary storage? I ask because Android 7 should make the base model 16 GB not matter if it can be replaced by microSD storage. But if it can't use the microSD as its primary drive using adoptable storage, the 64GB version is almost required. Just want to know if I need to modify my pledge." It'll support adoptable storage. We want to bring to you the full Android experience. @S. Nunn "Will we have the option to choose addons upgrades such as 64gb and power bank 7200mAh also during the SURVEY or do we have to do it NOW before the end of campaign? I don't want to miss out but haven't made up my mind . Also would be nice if the box had magnetic charging built in. But I must agree GPU,waterproof,and wifi are important." You don't have to do it now, but after the campaign it'll probably cost higher. Kickstarter numbers are special. @Jay M. W. Ice "I remember reading in earlier comments that you plan on beginning to mass produce these in July! If you aren't working on making the case water proof, why are you waiting so long?" It isn't as simple as you describe it :) @jorge a flores "i have verizon and i oder 4g eye dose it supports it" Hi Jorge! In the US, the Eye smartcase is supporting ATT and TMobile. @Suraj mandal "46 hour I'm very much excited to own eye case please try to finish this project soon" Thank you! We're very excited too!! @jaymn kelly "GUYS FORGET UPGRADES we need to focus on the wifi and gpu and make sure That they are upgraded they are the most important part without that the whole system is messed up" We'll ship a finished product. That was just the prototype. @Jay M. W. Ice "Any chance could you ship a bit early for me ? Or send it express ?" If we'll be able to we'll notify you. @Jenna "Will the case for the 6 also fit the 6s/7? I am worried I will get my case and upgrade my phone right after, then my case will have no use. Thanks so much." Yes, it's the same as for the 6s and the 7. @Shinichi Misumi "I have a question for you. I see that "Read more about campaign". Specifications page is written "Language 〜" But Japanese is not included. Why?" I've checked and we support Japanese. I've updated the Language section. @Jordan Amiel "I believe that the ip67 rating for the case being offered now would be the most likely way to reach $1M in the remaining 50 hours. People are likely holding off pledging until they can be certain this feature will be included, as it really is a phenomenally important one, especially given that the iPhone 7 and later devices will have this (or better) rating themselves. What's the point in a case for a waterproof phone that you can't get wet? Seems like a far more important feature than expanded on board memory or battery pack options. IMO" "I'd also be interested in what your response to the criticisms about the GPU and wifi cards is" I see your point and we really want to make it IP67 but the current funds don't allow us to do it. About the Wifi and GPU performance, is drivers (software) issue of the prototype, the final product won't have this issue. @Kirk Grentzenberg "While I am very excited about this case, I am wondering if there is going to a way to clip it to a belt, protect the screens, etc. and all of the jobs a standard case can accomplish? Will there be any of those features? Thanks!" Hi Kirk! The Eye smartcase is like any other case in terms of protecting your iPhone. About protecting the case screen, it's very hard to surfaces to touch or crack the screen so no need for a protection on it. @Justin Davis "I have Verizon and orderd the 4G version. What US carriers does it support? I'll need to change back to non 4G also is there microsd slot?" Hi! Verizon isn't supported ATT and TMobile are supported. You don't have to get the 4G in order to have a micro SD card slot. @Jeffrey Chan "Dear friend, Plan to upgrade phone from 6sPlus to 7Plus. Please advise if 7Plus eye case will fit to 6sPlus as well? Just in case I not going to 7Plus. I still manage to fit my existing iPhone. Please so kind to advise. Thank you in advance. Best Regards, J.C" All the Plus models use the same case model :) @Khai liang neoh "I pledge already for the 4g one ! How to choose 6plus jet black ?" At the end of the campaign you'll get a survey asking you to choose a model, color and address. @Jay M. W. Ice "Do you have a expected shipping date? on August 28th I am flying to israel for the year and need to decide wether to have my case sjipped to the us or to israel." We don't know the exact day in the month but it'll be shipped at the end of August. You can request to wait with the shipping for a week or two. @Herman Smestad-Samuelsen, we can't do it. @Ryan Thompson thank you! @John Liu "When you say "in the future" are you referring to a stretch goal or the iPhone 8 version or your next project? I will be more than willing to pay extra for the processor for a Verizon version!" I mean after we'll have the finished product and stable sales. @Beshoy Gadelrab Farah "Can you guys add the waterproofing for an extra charge??" We can only do it for all for free but not in this funding, it's too low for waterproofing. @jaymn kelly "Hi I wanna buy. Four just wifi eye cases since two eye 180 x2 360 +12 =372 is that okay" Yes, but please pm me after you do it in order for me to mention it in our system. @cetrana colonial "Great idea hoping we will get our hand on eye soon. questions: from what device 3.5 mm jack serve. is it selectable? can I storage music in eye and play it on iPhone or the other way around? can eye provide internet connection to iPhone? (not via hotspot) also can I purchase another eye or accessory after survey come out?" Hi! Thank you!! :) The Eye smartcase 3.5 mm headphone jack serves the iPhone as default. When no music is playing on the iPhone it'll serve the Eye. Yes, our iOS app will let you do it. Eye can supply internet connection to the iPhone only via hotspot. Yes, you can purchase but it'll cost more as the rewards are special for the Kickstarter campaign. @Ron Manaog "Even if all pledges are bought. It will never reach 1M." Don't worry Ron, we're taking care of that :) @Mo "How do I get the accessories?" Simple, you can always add to the amount of your pledge. Each accessory / add-on / storage to 64GB expansion has its own amount. You just need to add this amount to your pledge. @Dametries P Holmes "I am noticing quite a few let downs regarding service providers in the states. For those of us in places like Japan that use Au, Docomo or SoftBank; will their Sims work in the case?" Those are the bands the Eye smartcase supports: GSM: 850(B5)/900(B8)/1800(B3)/1900(B2) WCDMA: 850(B5)/900(B8)/1900(B2)/2100(B1) LTE FDD: 2100(B1)/1800(B3)/2600(B7)/800(B20) You should check with your carrier about the compatibility to those above. @Alfred Tambora "Hello Creator n Everyone, 4 days To Go! May The Force Be with you ���� ����" Thank you Alfred!! :) @Ron Manaog "1000th Comment :D. I just wanna say thankyou for your efforts." Thank you Ron!! :) @Kenneth Seah "so sad that it would not have waterproofing integrated due to the response below 1million , would the days to go be extended to another 15 day to 1 month so we can hit 1 million , so we can have a win win situation for all the backers ?" We're sad for it too, we really wanted to make it to a million and waterproof it. Unfortunately Kickstarter don't allow an extension of campaign and even if so we wont extend because we want to start working on producing the Eye smartcase. @Dave Burge "Is that 4G working for germany?" Yes. @Jay M. W. Ice "Unless you add more early birds for cheaper you will never reach 1 mill just not enough demand at current prices, to get waterproof either add cheaper options or lower goal" The lower prices were for the super early birds. There is a demand, but not enough people are entering to our campaign page because we are almost not doing any paid ads, we don't have cash for it. We depend and relay only on you guys for sharing it and also on the Kickstarter platform to feature us. Techsmartt YouTube channel got the prototype today and I hope he'll be able to make a video in time before the campaign end. @Mike Pak "How does the case actually interface with the iPhone (specifically the calls)? Is it through the lightning port or BLE? I ask because there are similar products (without the android part) that achieve interfacing with the second SIM through BLE, but I prefer a direct hardware interface if possible." Hi Mike! Our first priority is to do it via the Lightning port. @Abdullah Alotaibi "Hi I ordered x4 (4G cellular) units .. just wanted to upgrade one of the units to 64G and add one wireless charger .. my pledge now is $528 .. is this OK? Thanks" You are correct :) @GoreGamer "I was really hoping that this was this was going to Support Verizon. My Personal phone is an iPhone 7Plus on ATT and my Work phone is also an iphone on Verizon. Why were the Verizon / Sprint Bands not included and what would it take if possible to include those Bands? Are you looking to release a "Verizon" Version in the near future?" Including the Verizon and Sprint means to replace the processor to much more expensive one. We might consider it in the future. @Michael Lo "I'd like to see anandtech review this case! In a preproduction prototype closer to release form of course!" Yeah that'll be cool! @Hi Stanislav!! Thank you very much for backing us! About your inquiries: 1) First, it's in August. There was a mistake and I couldn't fix it because one backer already pledged for it. The schedule is realistic because we're using components and internal electronics design that are already in heavy production by our manufacturer for the smartphones he makes. The MFi process won't be a problem in terms of the schedule because we'll do it simultaneously. 2) The case doesn't uses the iPhone camera for itself, only mirrors its native camera app and the shots are saved on the iPhone. The aren't other things that the smartcase shares with the iPhone. 3) Yes, it has a Bluetooth and wifi module and it isn't interfering with the iPhone modules. Tested. 4) It has its own GPS module :) 5) It is possible actually :) but we won't support it. At least not in the first firmware. @Deborah "@creators, some questions: 1. When using dual sim, can both be used simultaneously for making calls and for mobile data? 2. How do you switch between the two to make / receive calls and surf the Internet? Thanks!" 1) Yes! :) 2) Receive isn't a problem because they work simultaneously. To make calls and surf the web you'll be able to choose, it'll be in the UI. @Dylan "Hello, You had said that in the U.S. the cellular connection only supports at&t and t-mobile , is that only for the major carriers? Could I get a pay as you go card or one time use card from Walmart and use it in the eye case?" Hi! If this SIM will be activated with ATT or TMobile then yes. @Sulaiman Aljoker "How can i add $59 ?" On the campaign page there is on option to change your pledge/reward. You click on it and there you can see the amount you've pledged. You just need to add to it $59 and then the 64GB model will be available to you. @Zak Kwan "About the add on battery, is it for the iPhone or eye or both can use the add on battery?" First, it's like any other external battery with USB sockets which means it can charge any device. The special thing about it is that it's in the shape of the iPhone so you want for some reason to go without the case, you have an external battery with a screen! It should look something like this: <url>"Just seen the vid on EverythingApplePro and apart from the glue around the screen edges it looks good. I am still concerned about where the SIM/storage slots are going to be and how robust they will be. If necessary, the case could be made a little longer to accommodate. Every effort should be made to be Apple certified so that a lightning connector can be used at the bottom" Thank you Martin! They will be in the back of the case, in the side that touches the iPhone back. As I've mentioned we follow all Apple's MFi guidelines and they'll approve it, just like they approve all other battery cases with a Lightning socket. @Jonathan Samuel "Hi, I have just pledged and would like to ask a couple of questions. 1) For the finishing product, will it be in those glossy kind of silicon cover? Those kind of shiny cover will tend to leave unsightly fingerprint marks. 2) For 4G cellular option, which side (iPhone or Android) do we answer and make calls from? 3) Will there be the usual vibration when we receive calls/messages from the Android side? Thanks and keep up the excellent work!" Hi Jonathan! Thank you for backing us :) 1) You can choose the matt finish one. 2) iPhone. 3) The ring/vibration will be on the iPhone side. @Jamieluk "I want pledge X10 units of Eye 4G. Please kindly contact me with regard to the shipping charges. I am in China. Thanks:)" All the shipping details show automatically after choosing the country. @Ibby "Great video. I also agree about the graphics processor needing a boost. It's extremely important to have a modern product at launch. Also, I noted your comment about the wifi speed issue being a software issue. I hope this is the case. Please provide your backers with a video of the updated speeds once this is fixed. Thanks and good work!" Thank you Ibby! @Jason Russell "Any chance of getting you to make the case in safety orange? I can see a lot of folks in the public safety sectors using an outward facing screen while communicating." Hi Jason! We don't plan to do it. @Sulaiman Aljoker "Do i need to change my pledge to the stretched goal $149 to get 64gb storage? I have already chosen the $149 since beginning?" Hi! No, if you want the 64GB version you just need to add $59 to your current pledge. @Bhavik "Please use USB-C instead of lightning, everyone loves USB-C and include the cable in the box. I can imagine Apple not allowing you to get the permit to use lightning, and then everyone's cases will be useless. USB-C is universal, the future and you could implement fast charging." Hi! First of all, nobody case will be useless, they all will function 100% because we follow all Apple's MFi guidelines and there is no reason they won't approve it, just like they approve all other battery cases with a Lightning socket. @Jody "When will a production intent sample be available for viewing?" At the end of July. @Heri Sim "Where is the port for the USB OTG on Android? Would like to plug in a high quality USB DAC." The Lightning port is used also by the case for its data transfers. @german g "So just finished the new video review seems everything looks great so far except the graphic processor. Why go all out on the phones main processor but leave behind the power on the graphics processor?" Hi! This is only a prototype, there's a bug with the graphics drivers, that's all the hardware itself is much more capable. In the production the graphics will work much better. @Benjamin Raffle "Will this thing work with Sprint service in Los Angeles?" It supports ATT and TMobile in the US. Sprint and Verizon unfortunately aren't supported. @Steve F "@creator, hopefully the WiFi chip can be tweaked or a different one as speeds were low as EverythingApple had said in their video about your case as we the backers will be using via wifi at home and out and about" You shouldn't worry about that, it's a software issue and not a hardware issue. @Bernard Ang "Hi, I just to to increase my pledge amount for those additional items featured correct? For example 149+20+59 For the wireless charger and 64gb option?" I've checked your pledge and it's correct. @Prashant Mudgal "A quick question, the dual-sim, will it be 4g/3g at least, across Asia a lot of countries have either retired or are retiring soon their 2G networks. So a dual-sim with a 4g/2g capability will pretty much be as good as a single sim phone, markets include Japan/ South Korea/ Singapore/ Thailand and I believe Australia too soon." Yes, the model with cellular connectivity have also 3G cellular bands. @Bùi Chí Thành "hey I just wanna say hi to everyone �" Hi! Thank you! That's so nice! @Edward "Will i have the ability to choose the case for the upcoming iphone 8 model?" Yes! :) @Edward "Do you make a holster or belt clip for the eye?" We don't plan to make it. @Heri Sim "Will there be USB OTG on Android?" Yes :) "If for whatever reason you fail to get MFi certification from Apple for the HDMI-over-lightning port Selfie feature, will I be able to get a refund?" We're not going for MFi for the HDMI, we'll use AirPlay client. "Is there a way to automatically throttle the CPU in Android if it overheats? Most Android phones run really hot and I am worried it would damage my iPhone or the longevity of its expensive built-in battery." The CPU will never get too hot because it has automatic thermal throttling. @Yura Dynin "Powerbank can work without eye case?" Yes :) @Adam Wheatley "I've ordered just a standard eye but have noticed that there are more expensive pledge options with 4G? whats the difference? Am I limited to 3G with the standard eye or can I add 4G as an addon?" The non-4G doesn't have SIM card slots. @Nathan wood "Definitely think you should ship it already rooted as you can brick devices if the person rooting the devices does something wrong in the process" We'll see what we can do about the root, it's not a simple thing to ship a device that has root from the box. @Dametries P Holmes "Can the SIM slots be used as an always on wifi hotspot using a 4G or LTE network?" Yes :) @Luke Barton "Will the non 4G model have the sim slots for the extra 258gb of storage?" Yes :) @Dominique "I have a question will the case fit both the iPhone 6 and 7, or will they be different cases altogether? I have both models, the reason being that one of the models is for work and I have an extra iPhone 6 laying around from work, which they gave me after a certain amount of time. Now, when I switch to the iPhone 7 I used my old case from the 6 on to the new phone and it works great. It did block a bit of the bottom camera, but it did not deter me from taking pictures. Since I have the regular version for both (not the plus), will the case fit both?" Yes, the case fits both :) @Sheikh Farhan Hummayun "Kindly make the waterproofing at 600k stretch goal..for free or with some additional amount... as it's very necessary to have this... kindly consider...." We really want to but it's very problematic for us to change the whole shell design for such funding amount. We won't charge for this any of our backers because it's not like the last stretch goals that you can choose whether you want to upgrade or not. In this case it's for free to everyone because all the production of the housing of the units will be in this special design. "What will the finished product look like and be made of? The prototype material looks like those cheap plastic/silicone cases you can get for $5 which is a turn off....." "The materials will be much more solid, beautiful, strong and durable. It won't be made of from this prototype materials." Mind elaborating as to what those materials are and how it will look??? The general shape and dimensions will be the same. But the finish will be in very high quality. It won't be only from silicon but a hard polymers mixed with a bit of TPU for easy mounting inside the case. The inner side will be covered with a very thin layer of rubber for shocks absorbing. @Elias Geh "When I have the additionlal battery di I place it instead the iphone?" Yes, it should look like this: <url>"How do I add the additional funds to get the bigger storage and battery? Also I've pledged but couldn't find an option to opt for the iPhone 7 plus? Or do we choose these at the end?" Hi! You just need to add the amount ($59+$24=$83) to your pledge. Yes, you choose all the details like model, color, add-ons and so on at the end. @Ken K "Is iPhone 6s and iPhone 7 (iPhone 7s) can share one case? I am not sure about the external changes of those two phones so I would like to know. Thank you." Yes, it's the same case for all the regular models, we don't know about the 7s yet, it might have other body then we'll need to design a new shell. @William "Is there a raised edge to protect the iPhone screen" Yes. @Ron Manaog "Charging while extensive use of Iphone can damage its hardware, is there a function to turn off charging?. For the update of Android OS will it be OTA? In the Youtube video eye is in cyanogenmod, are you going to use CM or are you developing your own software?,. In the campaign you mention about many possibilities of eye especially when rooted. Is it possible for eye to be pre-rooted before shipped to us?." Hi Ron! The charging is controllable. There will be OTA updates. The use of CM was just for this demo, there will be our own one but without bloatware. The Eye smartcase can be rooted, we're considering shipping it with a root option in the settings. For now all the devices are set to send without root option in the settings but you can still root it of course. @Terrel Williams "I suggested that if possible the eye could be engraved with the backer number and initials." Hi! I'm sorry but don't plan on doing it. @Terrel Williams "Any word on the engraving? Or is that out?" I'm sorry that I don't understand but what do you mean by engraving? @Nick Partridge no, I haven't. I can even tell you Nick that except of the charging (like any other battery cases that gets approved without any problem) the Eye can still run all its features by connecting wirelessly to the iPhone :) So the MFi is critical only for charging which isn't a problem to get. @Zacus "Hi.. may I know how are we going to collect it..? And iphone 7 plus is it able to use..?" Hi! Don't worry! After the campaign will end, you'll get a survey asking you about the iPhone model, color, add-ons/storage expansion and address. @Nick Partridge It's correct that we don't have the MFi yet, but I can tell you that we're following all Apple MFi (Made For iPhone) certification guidelines and there is no reason for us not to get certified and pay for the licence to use the lightning connector. @jorge a flores "i have a question i pledge 149 then i add 59 total 218 .00 whats my reword" Don't worry! After the campaign will end, you'll get a survey asking you about the iPhone model, color and address. In the survey you'll see the 64GB expansion because our system will recognize that you've added the $59 to your pledge. @Michael Lo "How many BLE connections can my iphone make? I understand my apple watch uses one BLE connection. Will this case work as a slave device at the same time? How fast is the communication between iphone and eye?" iOS supports 20 BLE slaves at the same time. While in standby the connection speed is 10 KB/s which is used for push notifications. When you unlock the Eye you'll get the speeds of your iPhone cellular data connection. @Jasper Pol "I love your project and have pleged for an Eye 4G. But I have a question. Could you please clarify if you choose to upgrade the storage from 16GB to 64GB, do you still use the 2nd SIM/SD card slot?" Thank you! Yes, everything stays the same, just more on-board storage. @Matthew Hicks "can i add two wireless chargers to the two pack 4G's?" Sure! Just add 20*2= $40 to your pledge. @Luke Barton "Will there be any external speakers in the case? Seems the ones in the phone would get covered up. That's my only concern. Otherwise this is so cool. I also plan on waiting until the next iPhone comes out. Will I be able to expand to 64gb later in the year but before the new iPhones announced?" There are openings for the iPhone's speaker and microphone. You'll be able to expand but in higher amount than $59. This amount is special for the campaign. @Evan Davison-Kotler "May I suggest you migrate the page to Indigogo once the deadline is hit, in order to allow for stretch goals to be reached past April 15th?" It's a good thinking but it won't help much because we'll start the final design pf the case and there can't be changes after that in the case itself. @Allen Johnson "Hello, I updated my pledge to include the extra $59 for the 64gb of storage, but I didn't get any area to add text to specify this. How do I know that it will be recognized? Thanks!" Hi Allen! Because we know the reward you chose and our system will recognize that you've added $59 on top of the reward, then it'll give you the option for the 64GB expansion. @Mujtaba "If the regular case is 0.52" thick. How much's thick gonna be with additional battery? Thank you" The powerbank will increase the the thickness by 2mm/0.07". @Matt "Can there be a $1 pledge added like most Kickstarter pages have so we can get credit for backing this as well as receive updates? I don't have an iPhone but i LOVE this idea and would love to support it!" Hi Matt! That's exactly what you did now :) @Ron Manaog "Can we get shipping info?. Like shipping from what country, etc." The shipping will be with a tracking number and with warranty. It'll be shipped from China in exclusion of European backers that we'll ship to them from another country. @Palm Bear "Couple of quick questions from a new backer here (if they're already answered somewhere and I missed it then I apologise) 1) How long will the battery last on it's own with the always on function of the display enabled? 2) If the battery of the case is empty, can it use the battery of the iphone to continue to work? 3) Does the android OS support bluetooth so that for example I can use bluetooth accessories with android apps? 4) Does the interconnectivity between the 2 devices (like using the android display as an external screen for the camera selfies) require some sort of api interface with the iPhone that Apple can disable at some point, or is this all handled through the direct lightning connection and cam it never be disabled by Apple? 5) Since the case supports Micro SD expansion, what are the benefits of having 64GB of onboard storage v.s. buying a 64GB extra micro SD card to expand the storage? 6) Can the Android OS be updated in the future and if so how? 7) How drop proof is the android screen? I know it has a raised besel protecting it from scratches, but how much impact protection does it have? Thanks in advance for your time !" 1) The always on display feature takes 1% of the battery for every hour. You can turn on/off this feature from the settings if you like to. 2) The case doesn't takes any power from the iPhone. 3) Yes :) 4) Some of the features don't require anything that can be disabled by Apple, such as the screen mirroring. Some of them do require, but we follow all Apple guidelines and there is no reason they'll disable some of the connections. 5) I'm pasting here @Fran San's comment as he describes this very good: "For those who don't understand the benefits having 64GB onboard storage (or more). My opinion is : - more installable apps, - fewer latencies using the apps, - transfer with the SD card to another device (if you don't use the SD card for app, but only for data) - Not an obligation to bake, but an oportunity" 6) Yes, we're giving two years of OTA updates for the next two major Android releases. 7) It'll be very solid and impact protect both itself and the iPhone like other though cases. The raised bezel is also protecting from drops. You're welcome :) @Jeffrey Chan "Dear Eye inventor, I just had a quick question that the 4G supports for Malaysia's Service Operator? Just double check before make decision. Cheers~! BR, J.C." Hi Jeffrey! Those are the supported bands: GSM: 850(B5)/900(B8)/1800(B3)/1900(B2) WCDMA: 850(B5)/900(B8)/1900(B2)/2100(B1) LTE FDD: 2100(B1)/1800(B3)/2600(B7)/800(B20) You should check with your carrier about the compatibility to those above. @Joe "I asked this awhile back never got a reply does the eye case work without being connected to the iPhone just curious" Like @Fran San said, the answer is yes. @Alfred Tambora "i just read mike wiseman comment below, and just know that 4g option are limited. would u mine to add extra buck for 4g option when reach 600.000? i would say this is more important than storage on board and batttery. please check consider that. I want eye to be no limit. and availabe use 4g in US, Asia and Europe. thanks." We also want to make the Eye smart case without limits but this bands and LTE connectivity in the USA will require us to use different chip-sets that are much more expensive and can be ordered in batches of hundreds of thousand only. We can't afford that. @Jay M. W. Ice "I did the math and you need to add more early birds to get to a million, and currently price wise you won't get TR hat much more adding cheaper such as more 130$ 4g will help you get there" Thank you! We're taking care of that, don't worry :) @Matt Wiseman "Question on the 4G in the US, as you aren't supporting US LTE networks (I just found out about this via previous comments) will it still connect at 3G in the US? Failing that, can it "piggy back" off the iPhone 4GLTE connection?" Yes, it can be used in ATT and TMobile at 3G. @Matt Wiseman "Looks like ubuntu is dropping the ubuntu phone. Should it be removed from this project? <url>" We'll give it a deeper look. Thank you! @jameszhang ""A battery bank in the shape of the iPhone and little bit thicker will be mounted inside the case." Thickness after the power bank add on pls?" The powerbank will increase the the thickness by 2mm/0.07". @Francisco Caeiro "Hi, I am trying to find the specs for the Android part. What kind of screen, screen resolution, processor and amount of RAM is it going to have? Love the idea! Thanks!" Hi Francisco! Thank you! AMOLED screen technology. FHD 1920*1080 resolution. Helio P20 processor. 3GB LPDDR3 RAM. @Sreekanth "@ESTI I'm still hopeful that you would support US LTE bands. Thats the only thing thats restricting me to upgrade my pledge to 4G version. I'm sure there are other US backers who are holding up on upgrading to 4G version, because of this limitation. Please make it clear to US backers (which now constitute 43% of your total backers) whether you would be supporting US LTE bands or not." We're sorry but as for now it doesn't support the LTE bands in the US. It do support high internet speeds on TMobile and ATT though. @David Rice "Can you make phone calls with the 4G version? Thanks!" Yes :) @Ramez Nourzada "So, how do I know if it's for the iPhone 7plus? Also I didn't really understand: does it already contain a battery? Or do I have to pledge an additional amount of money? Thanks!" After the campaign will end, you'll get a survey asking you about the iPhone model, color and address. The Eye smart case contains a battery that can charge the iPhone. If you want to use it as a power bank you have an option to add $24 for the powerbank add-on. @Wasim Khalid "I've backed an eye 4G however I'm not sure weather it is for IPhone 7 or IPhone 7 Plus that I backed. How would I know?" After the campaign will end, you'll get a survey asking you about the iPhone model, color and address. @Colin Orofeo "I backed the "X2 Units" pledge, how do specify add-ons such as the Power Bank add-on and the upgrade to 64GB for a specific Eye Unit?" If you want just one upgrade and add-on you should add only the amount for one unit and not two. @mohammad murad "Any idea when we will receive our case? Because i dont see any plans when you are going to begin production and shipping" The shipping will be at the end of August as mentioned on the rewards. @Johan Krüger Haglert "Will you deactivate the touch-screen on the screen turned down in all cases with some software? Otherwise it will give a very crappy user-experience because one will click everywhere without intending so. Something you may not have though about what do I know." Hi Johan! Yes, we found a way to deactivate and we'll implement it. @Ron Manaog "Will you have order tracking info for us during shipping?. Also can we get shipping information in the FAQ." Sure, you'll get a tracking number :) @Dylan McConnell "Hello creators, is there any chance you would consider making the port on the case a micro-USB instead of a lightning port? I think it would be more advantageous if iPhone users could benefit from the ubiquitous streamlined connectors that the androids have; then it would essentially have both ports (if I understand the setup correctly). Obviously this is just my opinion and should not be considered the standard view among backers, but if you would consider it then perhaps it is worth a poll?" We technically can't make two ports access because the iPhone Lightning one is occupied by the Lightning pin of the case for charging it on the go. @Ben Braunstein "What will the finished product look like and be made of? The prototype material looks like those cheap plastic/silicone cases you can get for $5 which is a turn off....." The materials will be much more solid, beautiful, strong and durable. It won't be made of from this prototype materials. @Chris Graham Graham Thank you Chris! @Jordan Blackburn "After reading some of the previous questions, am I correct in understanding that the port on the bottom of the eye will be a lighting port and not micro usb? If it is in fact lighting, will it be possible to use lighting headphones with the iPhone while it is in the eye case?" Yes :) @Zak Kwan "If I want to add-on the battery, it is just add into the pledge?" Yes, just add $24 to your pledge. @Chris Graham Graham "The FAQs say, "The iPhone's cellular data connection will supply the internet connection to Eye but not via hotspot..." Does this mean if we get an Eye without 4G, it will still have internet connectivity without wifi?" That is correct. @Hermes "How to add 64G to my order?" Just add $59 to your pledge. @Prakash S C "Heya guys, quick question. If we wait for the next iPhone and then decide we don't want that option, will we be able to revert our choice back to one of the current available options." Hi :) Yes. @Mohammed Dastagir "I'd like to buy 50 units of the 4G case for the 6s. How can I do that? Also, can someone get in touch with me for a POC at an enterprise level?" Hi! Yes, it can be done. I've sent you a privat message. @Yeck Lin Kiong "Hi, creator... I am still confuse with the powerbank functionality. Is the addon powerbank will be function like as iphone's battery case? Means when iPhone low battery, this eye can use as powerbank to charge the iphone." Hi! The powerbank is not a part of the case. Both powerbank and the Eye can be used to charge the iPhone. The case when the iPhone is mounted inside and the powerbank with a USB cable. @kuby "Hi I want to pledge 3 EYE-4G, how can I do? I have pledged one EYE-4G already." Hi! For this please change your reward to the "X2 units of Eye 4G for Laser Tag game" and add $149 for the 3rd one. @Meik Schlenther Those upgrade and powerbank add-on costs a lot to make so we can't give them for free. Please understand. @James Young "My current pledge is enough to cover the EYE, Charger, Extra memory and the Powerbank but there is no option for me to add the accessories(Charger, Extra memory and the Powerbank)." It's enough the way it is now. At the end of the campaign you'll get a survey asking you to choose a model, color, add-ons and address. @AT "By that I mean is the $24 powerbank able to be used and attached at the same time with the eye case or is it separate only? It can be used as a stand alone and also when mounted inside the Eye smart case. @Jay M. W. Ice Don't worry Jay, it's taking care of :) We'll add when needed. @jaymn kelly "Ik this may sound dumb but before you ship will we be allowed to add more things on like say later to add like maybe more eyes or powerbanks etc." Yes, you'll be able to add, but it won't be in the same price as on the campaign, it'll probably be in the retail price. @Alfred Tambora "oK Got It, so on my pledge, i just edit my amount pledge with extra $$$, So the Eye 149 + powerbank $24 + Storage $59 the amount i edit is $232, is it? the wireless charger will be available what color and how many Ampere? is it fast enough and safety? For the case finish color like jet black and matt black, could u provide more image? like front, left, right & bottom elevation. on video Unbox Therapy, eye case is jet black or matt black? the one u send the prototype for review. thank you eye. I cant wait to see the real things" 1) You are correct, it's $232. 2) Black. It's fast: Up to 5V-2A input and 5V-1A output. And yes, it's safe. 3) We have a lot of pictures on the campaign page. 4) On Unbox Therapy it was the Jet black but it won't look like that because we'll make it from another materials. @Muhammad Nurudin Bin Mawar "Hi there. Would like to enquire. If i purchase the X2 Eye lasertag option and i would like to add on the powerbank, will both Eye be included with powerbanks?" Hi :) It's up to you to decide whether you want a powerbank add-on for both and add $48, or only for one and then add $24. @Michael "I think a lot of people are confused and haven't read the fine print. The power bank add-on will be in the shape of an iPhone (basically) and will go into the iPhone slot. So, you will not be able to have the iPhone and extra power bank at the same time. Is this correct?" Thank you for clarifying! Yes, you will not be able to have the iPhone and extra power bank MOUNTED INSIDE at the same time. You can still use the powerbank externally, like any other powerbank. @BOYBOI "When we reach the million goal, if the the next iPhone is going to be IP68, will it be able to match it or it'll just be IP67?" This is too far away for me to answer. Lets come to the bridge first :) @wen kai chen "IS THERE AN OPTION TO TURN OFF THE SCREEN WHEN OTHER SCREEN IS IN USED" Sure. It'll be controllable through the settings. @Jay M. W. Ice "Esti claims to be an Israel company yet it is more expensive to ship too Israel than the United States? Also if you wan to hit a million, you will have to add more 4g eyes at 129$, if you look in the first 4 days this kickstarted got to 464K and then it ran out of the 129$ 4g eyes and then it took another two and a half weeks to get another 36k and hit the stretch of 500,000." We're an Israeli company but we don't do the shipping from Israel. Thank you for your suggestion! @Shane O'Neil "I understand you're only committing to ship Eye to your backers from August but what I'm saying is when will it be on retail sale? Or are you only producing enough to give to your backers? Basically only backers will be able to purchase Eye and not the retail public?" Sure, the public will be able to get Eye but we can't commit to a certain date. @Nicholas Elkins "If I upgrade my pledge to get 2 units and I want both to have 64gb and 10,000mAh, do I have to pay $166 ($83 per unit)?" Yes. Please pay attention that the powerbank is an add-on and not an upgrade of the internal electronics of the Eye smart case. It'll look something like this: <url>"When will Eye be shipping to the general public? If early birds are getting it around August, will it be on general sale before Christmas?" We're committing for shipping scheduale only to our backers. It's reasonable that it'll be available for the public until then. @Nicholas Elkins "After the kickstarter ends, when do you expect to start mass producing them? Then when do you plan to start shipping them?" We plan to mass produce at the end of July and ship at the end of August. @Gordon Fang "do you have any pictures of power bank attached on iphone?" @Grace "hi do you have some images of how thick the case will be with the power bank option ?" Hi! It should look something like this: <url>"sorry Guys, i cant found any add on menu? could u guys assist me step by step? im using kickstarter apps on ios. thanks" Hi Alfred! If you want an add-on you need to add its amount to your pledge. You can play with your pledge here on Kickstarter. For the wireless charger you need to add $20 to the pledge. For the 64GB of in-board storage you need to add $59 to the pledge. For the powerbank you need to add $24 to the pledge. @Mohamad Kamsani "10 days to go and we have yet to hear of the date for the live demo. Anything set up yet?" You are right! We really want to but our prototype is always occupied, now it on its way to EverythingApplePro YouTube channel for review. We're working on another one and we hope we'll be able to go live with it. @Nicholas Elkins "If y'all don't achieve the $1 million goal for water proofing, will there be anyway to get that as an add on for people who backed the project?" Unfortunately no, this is something in the design of the device itself. @Karan "@ESTI Inc :- Any discount for backers who are willing to pledge for 64gb + powerbank?" Hi Karan! I'm sorry but we don't have a special bundle price for this. @Thad Karbowsky "i also added the 83 for power bank and upgrade" Thank you Thad! @Jordan Blackburn "Does the version of Android on the Eye allow root access?" Yes :) @Xavi Wijntje "Hi Esti, for the nee pledge, both the powerbank AND the 64GB expansion total $83! My new pledge is now $212 is that correct? Can you please check and clarify for me." Hi Xavi! Yes, you are correct and the shipping that depends on your country. @Nicholas Elkins "Congrats on the 500k! If I add $24 for the powerbank, $59 for the 64 gb and $20 for the charging stand which will add up to $103. I add that amount to my pledge and I get all 3 things, correct?" Thank you! Yes, you are right! :) @Marvin James Mangay "Hi, another question, what if we use the option to wait for the new iPhone, but then the new iPhone gets released but decides not to get one, will we able to rechoose any of the existing cases, say iPhone 7plus?" We'll set some deadline for this after the campaign end, you'll see this info on the survey that you'll get. @Xavi Wijntje "Hi Esti, i want to add both the powerbank AND the 64GB expansion, do i need to add both the $24 and $59 total $83? Please clarify this for me." That's correct :) @Malcolm Toms "Hi ESTI, I pledged $129 for an Eye 4G initially, then when I heard about the 64GB upgrade possibility, pledged extra for that and the wireless charger - but before the $500K goal was reached. I saw that in reply to another backer, you told them to wait for the $500K to be reached before adding the $59. Does this mean that because I showed confidence in you and pledged extra support early, I will miss out on the 64GB upgrade and wireless charger unless I increase my pledge further? If true, that would leave a nasty taste in the mouth." Hi! You'll get it even if you added it before. You believed in us! :) @woowear "Hi @ESTI! So i just add 83$ to my current pledge, i will get my EYE with both power bank and 64GB?" Hi @woowear!! Yes :) @Benjamin Raffle "Also, if we want to add both the powerbank AND the 64GB expansion, we need to add both the $24 and $59, correct? Just want clarify because I want BOTH!" Yes, you need to add both. @김범석 "I added $ 24.Do you add a power bank to my covenant?" Yes, at the end of the campaign you'll see an option for the powerbank in your reward. @김범석 "I added $ 24.Do you add a power bank to my covenant?" Yes, at the end of the campaign you'll see an option for the powerbank in your reward. @Ron Manaog "Hi good day :D. First of all I would like to thank you for the update of 500k stretch goal. I am extremely happy about this update, now I can add $24 to my pledge for the powerbank. For my question, I was wondering, If for example I ordered case for Iphone 7+ which is 5.5inch. Then I tried to connect the eye to an iphone 6 which is a smaller device with 4.7inch. This will result to excess space and misaligned camera and etc (appearance problem). Will the eye still work functionally?." Hi! We're also extremely happy! Nothing will happen, it'll all keep running as usual. @Moses "Hi @ESTI! I'm so excited that we've reached the $500K and we can expand in internal memory to 64GB! So just to be sure, if I want to expand to 64GB I need to add $59 to my current pledge?" Hi Moses! We are super excited too! Yes if you want to expand to 64GB you need to add $59 to your current pledge. @Shane O'Neil "Will us Early Birds be fully refunded if something should happen to prevent the case being made?" Hi Shane! Kickstarter is a platform to support creators make their product alive and available for the public. You're supporting our project to mass produce the Eye and getting a reward for your support. We'll use your backing only for the project success and make the Eye a reality and ship to you a great and finished product asap. Because your support is going to development and manufacturing we won't be able to return it. We follow and will follow all Kickstarter rules, as they mentioned here: <url>#faq_41853 @Sohajda Ábel "Hey! Is the product MFi approved or your intention is to start the procedure after the campaign?" Hi! The Eye smart case is following all Apple's MFi guidelines, but we didn't start the process because a lack of funding. We'll start it as soon as the campaign will end. @Nathaniel Tan "hey! am an iphone 7 user, not iphone 7+. i would be given an option to choose after the campaign is completed right? :) thanks alot !" Sure! After the campaign will end, you'll get a survey asking you about the iPhone model, color and address. @Benjamin Raffle "Interesting question: This awesome product enhances the iPhone's functionality, which is obviously the biggest selling point for all of us. However, does the Eye have the ability to work independently from an iPhone, meaning can we just use the Eye even when it is not attached to an iPhone as its own standalone device? Curious if the product will be capable of functioning on its own!" Hi! Thank you! Yes, the Eye case can run as a stand alone. @Alfred Tambora "I almost Forgot! when i answer phone from Eye, ist im using iphone ear speaker? how Eye connected to my iphone? ist using bluetooth? if using bluetooth then i cant connect my other device like bluetooth headphone? tq" Yes, you're using the iPhone hardware for voice input and output. The voice input and output will go through the lightning connection to the Eye case. Our iPhone app will handle all of this connection. @Solomon L Johnson "When you say that when the eye is connected to the PC/Mac it recognizes it as data, does that mean we will be able to put music and other materials from the computer on the case or not?" Yes :) That's another beauty of this smart case- you finally can just drag and drop files to your device and not use iTunes :) @Daniel "For eye with 4g capability, does it mean that I am able to have 2 mobile phone numbers working at the same ? Or is it restricted to only one selected number at any given time ? Both can work simultaneously. @Joe "Not sure if you answered this does the case work without the phone" Yes :) @Brandon "I want this case so that I may use Android Auto in my car. Because having Google Maps on my dash instead of Apple Maps is worth it. Question is, if this is plugged in via USB, is the iPhone automatically going to take priority and not allow me to use Android Auto?" As for now, if the iPhone is mounted inside the case and the case is connected to the car, only CarPlay will work. We want to give the user the option to choose but it takes more development so we can't commit to this feature, Maybe in a software update we'll add this. @Tsubakixv "@ESTI Inc Can you have bluetooth devices such as a Samsung Gear S3 specifically connect to Eye instead of connecting to your iPhone?" Yes, sure. @Jay M. W. Ice "Also, if it's let's say 20$ more if you want the charging pad add a 115$ option to get the regular eye with the charging pad because there are still 95$ eyes left and if people select that instead of the 95$ one it means more people could et the 95$ option" The $95 reward is no longer available. @Jay M. W. Ice "Also you would have better chance of hitting stretch if you added more 129$ 4g" Thanks!! Added! @Jay M. W. Ice "I got the super early bird and was wondering how much do I need to add to get 4g" $34 @Marvin James Mangay "Hi, if I connect the Eye with an iPhone to a PC/Mac will iTunes detect the iPhone while explorer detects the Android at the same time?" Hi When connecting the case to the computer it'll recognize the case only for data. We'll probably add an option for it to be controlled. But for now, this is the functionality. @jaymn kelly "For buying more of the eyes can you get a discont on adding more storage 59 is a lot for 4 devices 236 I know you can use as but internal can't be changed and I'd like to get the highest" Hmm, it's a special case indeed. You've sent you a pm. @Fran Ramos Sanchez "People say that 64GB its good for internal storage and install apps but... those expansion can be achieved by micro sd card right? We can use this sd for internal storage?" Yes, you can use the SD card slot also. @Steve F You're welcom @Kenneth oreilly "Hey I got the early committed subscription. I would like to change to the 4g model. How much do I have to add?" Hi! The committed subscribers need to add 34$ if they want the 4G model. @Steve F "If the $500,000 is not met, you have the option to add $59 I believe to get your Eye with 64GB internally instead of 16GB. If the goal is met then you don't have to add anything." This isn't correct. For now nobody can't get the 64GB expansion. After we'll reach $500K then the option will be unlocked and if you want to expand to 64GB then you'll need to add $59. @soonkok "Hi, I'm a bit confusing now. I wish to have the on-board storage to 64gb ads-on. I must add 59 in my pledge now(before you closed your campaign) or just wait it unlocked then only can choose the add-on and raise my pledge?" You need to wait until we'll hit the $500K, then add the $59 for the expansion. @Kyle Kay "Can calls be answered/made from the Eye android screen with the additional SIM cards?" Yes :) The iPhone hardware will be used for voice input and output. @Sreekanth "Hi @ESTI team, Regarding US LTE bands, have you guys decided on what you be supporting on EYE? Around 42% of your backers are from US. So, hopefully you will please US backers." Unfortunately US LTE bands are still not supported. But other bands in the US are still supported for ATT and TMobile. @Prabu "Hi I am from India , do I need to pay extra import duty while case being delivered to me by courier? if yes how would I do it?" We'll need to check that out please. @Michael Schiefele Thank you very much for your smart comment! @jameszhang "Hi heard it's gonna be shipped out from China, can we get free shipping if shipping addr is in China?" We won't let our European backers to pay those taxes and customs. We'll find a solution to ship from other location to Europe. @Markus Klein "Again a question to the shipping route... is it really send from China directly to the backers? Because than in Europe we have to pay taxes and costums. (For this product about 100 €)... the most kickstarter will send it to a location in Europe and than to the backer. Sending from China directly, than the Eye is to expensive... sorry" We'll check this out again. @Herman Smestad-Samuelsen "You should send a prototype to other youtuber's like: Techsmartt, EverythingApplePro and Jonathan Morrison." The Eye case is on its way to Philip from EverythingApplePro and to Techsmartt, I wasn't able to get the address of Jonathan Morrison and of Casey Neistat. @Sheikh Farhan Hummayun "2 questions... 1. Where can I find link for the referral program.... 2. I am currently working in China and I don't know if I will be here after July.. when can I change my shipping address ? And thank you for considering both the goals at 500k..." 1. Here: <url>"We definitely need some CAD drawings or something to give us an idea on how this battery pack looks like b4 the campaign ends." <url>"Are there pictures available of the case itself? Or at least the prototype?" All the pictures in the campaign are of the case prototype itself. @BOYBOI "Thanks a lot for the change in the goals. This move will make many of the current and upcoming backers happier. :) Maybe you should also give some more samples to Youtubers for their review to gain the popularity of this case. Thanks again." You are welcome! We want each and one of our backers to be happy and satisfied :) @tanquart "Hey, is there a chance to add aptX Support to the Bluetooth Modul? As the iPhone does not support this high qualitive BT audio codec, it would be great if you do! :)" We'll need to check that out. As for now we don't support it. @lag niape "Sorry naive here but how to add the $20 up charge for wireless charger!" Hi! Not naive at all! It's very simple, just go to the campaign page, then click on 'Manage your pledge' and there you can add those $20 for the wireless charger. @Michipmi "Hi I just did read that the shipping will done from china Does that mean , i live in europe i will have to pay the custome fees as well ??? Please let me know" Hi We don't know the costumes rules in Europe so we can't tell if you need to pay those fees or not. @Philip "How much I need to add for Wireless charging unit and Metal tag for car mount?" For the wireless charger you need to add $20 to your pledge. The metal tag is a standard, you don't need to add nothing. If you want to use it in your car you can buy magnetic car mounts everywhere we don't offer the magnetic mount itself. @Benjamin Raffle "I actually agree that you would have a much better chance of reaching the stretch goals if you added more of the single 4G devices for the $149 price tag. I think the reason you're having issues boosting the campaign beyond what you have is that people are turned off by the lack of this option. I know some have said this before, but I just want to reiterate that, as a salesperson and businessman that has worked in CPG for years, the reason your campaign has plateaued is because this option has expired. Just throwing it out there!" Thank you for your suggestion! We've added more 4G rewards in the same pledge amount. @Robert Colbert "How much RAM does the device have? (Not storage, actual processing RAM)? 1GB, 2GB, 4GB?" 3GB LPDDR3 RAM @Ethan Livers "I think there's a spelling mistake in the FAQ question about Eye connecting to the internet. Instead of saying "it consumes a lot of power" you said "it consumes a low of power"" Thank you Ethan! Fixed! @Thomas Aarts "Can you guys add more 4G versions for around 119-129$ so we will be able to reach the stretch goals?! As i myself would also upgrade" I'm sorry but we won't add more of those, it was for the super early birds. @Jerry James "Come on let's forget about the optional upgrade from 16GB to 64GB of on board storage... This case needs to be waterproof to match the iPhone 7's IP67 water resistant rating! This is what is really needed. Do a survey asking that and you will see that is what people actually want. You can buy a 64+ GB Micro SD Card for way cheaper than $59 on Amazon. And an external batteries are super cheap and very competitive a lot cheaper than $24! Give us a Waterproof Case just like the iPhone :)" We really want to match the iPhone water resistance rating but that means a change in the body design, those things are expensive. That's why the IP67 stretch goal is so high. @Michael "When the product is completed where will they ship from?" At the end of August. It'll be shipped from China. @Shia "I am also on the side for keeping the original 500k stretch goal as an extension in battery life because it seems more beneficial than adding in built-in storage that can just be added anyways via micro sd card. In the end of it all, I hope that the ones that backed this project originally, with this feasible stretch goal in mind, get the opportunity to get the expanded battery stretch goal that got me and many others excited about it in the first place." Please check out the last update and its comment section. @james Fountain "Hello . I backed the device that didn't have the 4G ,but have since changed my mind. How much would I need to change my pledge to? Do I just need to cancel my original pledge and choose the one for 4G. I would also like to add the additional storage(64G) and the powerbank." Hi! You need to change the reward and not add to the current pledge. @Nathan wood "Hi just backed this just read a comment the eye can't connect to hotspot on iPhone but it does by BLE what does that?" Hi Sure it can connect to the iPhone hotspot if you want it to. @Jesse Oldfield "Hi I've added $20 to my pledge. Is there any thing else I need to do to receive the wireless charger?" Hi If you've chose a reward and added $20, you'll get the wireless charger with your Eye device. Thank you @Fran San! :) :) @Eddie Boyles "This is the phone case that one side will be apple stuff and the other side Android right ?" Yes :) @Jay M. W. Ice "Add 4,000 earlyburd eye 4g at 129.99 and you whould hit 900000 in few days those at that price where beat seller" Thank you! We'll consider it! @Anthony "I pledge $119 for a eye without 4g but now I think I want one with 4g how do I go about switching and with a 4g eye can I still use it only using wifi ?" You can switch to the 4G reward :) And if you want to stick with the base model you can connect with it to the internet: When no WiFi available: The iPhone's cellular data connection will supply the internet connection to Eye but not via hotspot because it consumes a low of power, but via BLE. When WiFi is available: Eye will connect to it, just like the iPhone @Grace "Hi i am still indecisive about the powerbank. Mainly because i need to see some pics/video on how it will look. How tick it will be" Hi! It should look something like this: <url>"Hi, I have a couple questions 1. For the wireless charger what kind of power plug is it going to have? I am in Canada and we use the North American socket, will you ship with that? 2. Can you guarantee at this stage that you will have software which allows us to switch between Apple Carplay and Android Auto? Thanks" Hi! 1) You get the charger with a USB cable only, you need to use your own wall charger to turn it on. 2) As we mentioned, as for now, when the iPhone is mounted inside the Eye and connected to the car, you'll get only Carplay and not Android Auto. If the iPhone isn't mounted inside Eye and connected to the car, only then you'll get Android Auto. We promise to do our best to give a software switch even when the iPhone is mounted inside Eye, but we absolutely do not commit to this feature. @BOYBOI "Is there a switch on Eye for charging the iPhone? as i wouldn't want it to charge all the time. Thanks in advance." Yes, it'll be controllable through the notification drop. @Karan "How about adding Combined Stretched goal wherein backers have options to add power bank, extra storage or both? I'm reconsidering to buy 64gb storage and power bank and wireless charger too. I mean I want all three addons. If you can provide small discount to backer who opt for all the three add ons? Once again thanks for crafting wonderful product." It'll be very hard for us to make those two in the same funding, that's way we make it in different levels of funding. About adding less if you want all three, we'll consider it. @Mike Pak "I personally like the new expanded storage goal better. The power bank was good, but it's not 10000mAh in the case, rather its another battery you stick inside the case, so you can't have the phone and the added battery inside the case at the same time. I'd rather just get a separate power bank so that I can charge the case and phone while still using all the awesome features when together." The powerbank add-on can be used as a stand alone with it's 7200mAh. @Felix Chen "Hey guys, the original $500k stretch goal power bank is an add-on, not for free. "Add 7200mAh (on top of 2800mAh) for a total of 10000mAh, enabling Eye to act as a portable power bank ($24)." - From their campaign page @Herman Smestad-Samuelsen The Eye case already comes with wireless charging capabilities, you only need to add-on $20 for the dedicated wireless charger." Thank you for your help :) Here is the survey guys! :) <url>"power comes before storage storage can be replaced by a memory card if it's 2800 mah i will need a power bank to make them work for the rest of the day." We just get the impression that most you guys want more the on-board storage. We're sorry for all other backers. I think we should do a survey, that way we'll get an absolute results and not only impressions. I'll prepare the survey now and send a link here and on an update that'll be close only to backers. @Herman Smestad-Samuelsen "If I ad 40$ will i get both the wireless charging and the charger?" You don't need to add nothing to get wireless charging capabilities! If you want to charge wirelessly and don't have a charger, just add $20 and not $40. @Ron Manaog "Disappointed. :(. I already have 128gb memory card ready. All I need is more power to the eye and the powerbank that fit in the eye instead of the iphone design seems awesome. But now you changed the pledge :(. It feels like supplying power to the eye and charging the iphone, a 2800mah battery wont last long. :( and I dont want to bring a powerbank with a cord while outside. And the idea of eye working on its own without iphone but will still look like a phone is very great :D. But now its not possible :(. Totally disappointed :(" Please don't be, it was just a stretch goal and not a main feature. We saw that you backers wanted the storage expansion more than the powerbank and that's why we've changed it. We started a new ways to reach new potential backers and I hope we'll reach also the $900K goal, then unlock also the powerbank add-on and then everyone will be happy :) @Jeffrey Chan "Dear Eye Inventor, I am deeply sad to heard that you are changing the goal for 500k with optional add on additional storage to 64gb with extra charges...those expansion can be achieved by micro sd card right? Perhaps additional free power capacity is something more desirable and useful for backer. Could you please reconsider to give optional that backer can choose either they wish to go for storage or extra battery capacity? Please... Your sincere supporter, Jeffrey Chan" Hi Jeffrey Chan! The powerbank add-on is an exteernal device that can be mounted inside the Eye when you don't use it for your iPhone it can also be used as stand alone battery without mounting it inside the case. This powerbank isn't a free reward. @yuen jin chuan "Will the lightning plug in the case be MFI certificate? Will it be not regconised by the iphone after a few iphone firmware update??" We're following all of Apple MFi guidelines and we'll request an MFi certificate and get it, then we'll pay for the licence to use an original Lightning connectors. @目艮镜 "Can eye without cellular connectivity connect to wifi?" Yes! :) @Edward Eckert "Just upgraded my pledge for 2X of the eye by $118 to get both of them upgraded to 64 GB! But there was no where to leave notes or to let you know what the added amount was for. Is this automatically known because of the amount?? Thanks Ed" Thank you for your bigger support Ed! Don't worry about the recognition of the added amount, we know you've added $118 to your pledge, so you'll get the option to choose those storage expansions. If whom didn't add, he won't get an option to choose an extra storage. @Robert Shanahan "ESTI, I wanted to send a small thank you for your constant updates and communications. While this should seem like a simple task, it does not happen as often as it should in the Kickstarter community. This boggles my mind because I would have thought the inventor would love to promote and talk about their product. I have talked about this project to many people because its exciting and new. The product has so much potential, and it is one of the first products I am truly looking forward to. Like a child waiting for their birthday to get presents, this product can not come soon enough. You are doing a great job. Please keep the updates and info coming. Regards, Robert" Hi! We're so excited too! I hate to spam with a lot of updates, but I get your point and consider to update more often. @Gordon We need to fix it. It's nano SIM card. The non-4G model has one slot and supports only micro SD card. The 4G model has two slots for SIM cards and one of them supports a micro SD card instead of a nano SIM. That means you can have simultaneously one SIM and one micro SD card or two SIMs without a micro SD card because its place is taken by the second SIM card. It's a special slot that's used by a lot of dual SIM smartphones. @Jonathan Ng "Will the cover automatically charge iphone when connected ? Is there an estimated production time line?" The default is charging automatically, but it'll be controllable from the Eye case OS. The production should start at the end of July. Please also read the 'Risks and challenges' section at the bottom of the story page. @Steve F "Also @Creator, instead of having a 7200 mAh battery pack how about having a 3000 mAh battery pack for a lower stretch goal?" There is no difference for us between 7200 mAh to 3000 mAh in terms of production. In both you need to design the housing, internal electronics and manufacturing. We can't commit to so many things for lower goals. @Shrey Gediya "How to select the add on ,i want the wireless charger? Please help because i had no options while pledging." Check out Steve's comment. Thank you Steve! :) After the campaign will end, you'll get a survey asking you about the iPhone model, color, address and the add-on you want of you've pledged the $20 more. @Grace "Will the finish of the case be of beter quality. Looking at the photos now it looks very cheap ...." Yes, definitely. It'll be much more solid, beautiful and protective. @Armando Abrahams "So I added $160 to my pledge to get 2 wireless chargers and expand storage to both units. So it came out to a $350 pledge. Is that correct?" Please don't add to your pledge for 64GB until we'll reach the $500K goal, only then it'll be unlocked. We'll update when we'll reach this goal. So for now you need to add only $40 for the two wireless chargers you want. @Deborah "Hi! I would like to know what size sim cards will fit to create dual or triple sim capability? Micro, nano? Also, can one receive calls with both sims in 'on' mode or does one have to switch and turn off one sim to operate another? Thank you!" Hi Deborah! Nano sim card will fit. You can receive calls on both SIMs simultaneously. @Herman Smestad-Samuelsen "Is there any other features that i have to pay extra to get besides the wireless charging feature?" No need to pay extra for wireless charging capabilities. If you have a wireless charger you can use it, if not, you can add $20 and get a dedicated one. The only FEATURE you need to add extra is the cellular connection-SIM card slots. I've highlighted FEATURE because there are add-ons and might be a storage expansion that do needs to add extra for whom that want them. @WONG, Ho Cheong "Can I know the connection for the voice call of Android using iPhone speaker and mic? Over BLE, USB or others?" Lightning connection. @german g "Wait we have to pay extra for wireless charging ??" No need to pay extra for wireless charging capabilities. If you have a wireless charger you can use it, if not, you can add $20 and get a dedicated one. @Terrel Williams "Definitely switch those two. I'm sure we'll be able to meet that goal quicker. Also just for confirmation if I want to add another eye and or a wireless charger will I still be on the same shipping queue spot?" Yes. @willy chai "Any over heat solutions?" No problem with that, when overheating the Eye will downgrade its performance until it's on the right thermal level. Just like any other smartphone. @WeededDragon1 "Will the final product also have a small lip above the iphone side for drop protection?" Right now it has a very very tiny lip, a lot of you asked to make it a little higher. We'll probably add to it in order to give some protection to the iPhone screen. @Stephanie "Are all of the different add-ons that we need to add to our pledges to get listed somewhere? I've checked the FAQ and the main campaign page and didn't see them there and I don't have time to go through all of the comments. Thank you!" Right now there is only one add-on which is the wireless charger. @Sheikh Farhan Hummayun "That's a very good idea to change the 900k goal and merge with the battery pack... But how much do we need to add then for 64 gb or it will be free :D" Update for 64Gb you need to add 59$ to your pledge. @mohammad murad Sorry but from what I saw most of you wanted the storage expansion option. @Felix Draxler-Weber The powerbank wasn't for free either guys. **Update** Hi everyone! We've switched between the stretch goals! Now on $500K we'll offer an upgrade to 64GB on board storage. Adding $59 to your current pledge will give you 4 times more storage than the base Eye storage, from 16GB to 64GB! Please note that it's an optional expansion, you don't have to change your pledge if you don't want this expansion. We'll add this info also to our next update! :) @Doctor Donna "I'm very excited for this project. My job requires more than 1 phone line and it'll be very convenient to have multiple lines in one device for in Canada or internationally. What is the shock resistance on the device?" We didn't tested our prototype for shock resistance. The final product will be rugged and solid that'll protect the iPhone and the case itself in the best way! @Michael Schiefele Thank you for participating in our comment section! And it's a good idea to add that to the FAQ. @Hugo Alwén "The biggest problem with android is the small internal memory 16Gb. When you update apps you have to manually move the app to the memory card that's why I'm really looking forward to 64Gb so every time I update my 400 bought apps don't need to move every updated app manually to the memory card.. A good option for you is to make it a choice for 64Gb directly at the pledge... Best regards from a Superuser..." We're actually thinking about replacing the 64GB internal storage $900K goal, with the battery bank $500K goal. What do you guys think about it? @Herman Smestad-Samuelsen "I just added 20$ to my pledge will i now get wireless charging?" Yes, you'll get a wireless charger :) @jaymn kelly "No just the dock" Can you please clarify your question? @Herman Smestad-Samuelsen "Do you need to add 20$ to get the wiereless charging feature?" Yes. @Bhavik "Which part of the case has the slot for the sim cards and micro SD card? Can you please post images for this on the 4.7" iPhone" On the back side of the case. Our current prototype doesn't have those slots. You can see all the working stuff on the prototype in the Unbox Therapy video: <url>"When can we expect the product to ship to backers? More specifically in the U.S.A." At the end of August. @Therian "Hello Everyone, Will the case have wifi support? Thanks. Best regards." Yes :) @Alex Vazquez "Is it strong enough to run Pokémon go?" Yes, sure! @Alvin Pan "May I know if Android Auto or Apple CarPlay is activated when plugged into a car? Are we able to select the one preferred? Thanks!" Apple car play will run. We'll try to let the user choose via software but for now, only CarPlay will run when the iPhone is mounted inside the case. @Terrel Williams "Hey l. Just thought it may be a cool idea if it's not to much of a cost. But it would be nice to brag about being first to have an "eye" so would it be possible to engrave the backer number and initials on the eye it self with shipment? Hi Nice and cool suggestion! We'll write it down and if it'll be easy to execute, we'll do it. @George Soong "I was wondering whether it is possible to add the capability to attach add-on lens to this case, for example, Exolens-Zeiss lens or the OOWA lens which had also a successful campaign. This give your case a wider usage for people who want more functionality in a limited size without adding much cost." We've never tested it. @Steve F Thank you for your help! @Vijay Venkatesh "Hi I have added 54 $ to my pledge please ship 4g version" If you've added $54 to your pledge, you'll get the 4G version indeed. @Adrian Riley "I appreciate your answer and I am glad to be a backer." Thank you! @Sean "How can I go about getting the wireless charger?" You just need to add $20 to your pledge. @Marco Peluso "hi, first of all I want to say this is a wonderful project and I'm glad we can help you make it happen! I just have one question, to transfer files on a USB stick (with an Android file manager) I have to buy a lightning usb stick? Thank you for the reply :)" Hi! Thanks! A lightning USB stick isn't good for this. You'll need some kind of micro USB to Lightning adapter. @Terrel Williams "Hey. Does the iPhone have to be turned on for the eye to be on? I plan on taking a trip out the country and want to use my eye for communication versus paying higher charges for out of country roaming charges? Usually when I travel out the country I turn my phone off to avoid those charges completely." The Eye can work as a stand alone device. @maxfield majka "I'm concerned about horsepower for running apps. While the ram and internal storage are more than enough, will the CPU be able to handle graphical rendering for games? Nothing insane but low to small level games?" Definitely yes. @Vijay Venkatesh "Hi I need to go for 4g version early bird how much I need to pay extra" You need to add $54 @Fran San "Looks like that the 900 000 streach goal will not be reached... I think that many of bakers will cancel their pfledge without 64GB internal memory. I'm one of them." It'll be very hard to reach. We're doing our best to reach it. I'm very sorry to hear it, we don't want you to go for this reason because you have an option to insert a 256GB micro SD card to it. They don't cost much these days. @Kenneth jackson "When are you planning on applying for MFI certification to keep up your projected Aug2017 rollout?" Right after the campaign will end. @jameszhang "Hey just saw Android O launched and it's awesome, wonder if eye's hardware is good enough for it?" Hi! Yes, the hardware is compatible. @Karan "Any possibility of adding VoLTE as a new stretch goal? Or a combined goal of 64gb internal storage + Multi Boot + VoLTE?" Multi boot is a very complex thing so we can't lower its level. We're considering adding VoLTE to the 64GB goal. @AG249 "Just read again and saw there is an SD slot. How does that work for IPhone? Why exactly can we back up to the card? Isn't ios very restrictive with what goes in/out of the phone?" You can back up pictures, videos, music, docs, files and more. @Amir "Is using the ear piece and microphone via Lighting really possible? Would have thought Apple got some hardware/software restrictions there - or have you found a away to circumvent this?" You can't just use it of course. We'll use our app to do it. Anyway, it'll be seamlessly, you won't need to open it manually or something like that. @jaymn kelly "I have a question if I change my pledge to get more eyes while my backing change because I'm number 6" You won't lose your position. @Adrian Riley "How does this device interact with the Iphone, other than just charging the battery? Can I access photos, videos, and music from my Iphone? This seems as if I could just multitask between two devices. Like ducktaping an Iphone and Andriod together." It has a full data connection via the Lightning port and in some cases via BLE. Yes, you can access data on the Android side from the iPhone. The interaction is very deep. @Sreekanth "@ESTI Over 30% of the backers here are from US, yet you don't support LTE bands of US Carriers. Really strange?" I'm sorry but it's very complicated. You'll get 3G cellular connectivity in ATT and TMobile, which is very good. We promise to do our best to make it even more compatible then it is now. @EWJ "Suckers, that what we all are here. This product if delivered will not happen until Dec 2017 if we are lucky. The logistics and licensing deals on the machining will take 4-6 months alone." Don't troll here please. We'll ship it in time. Also, read the risks and challenges section please. @Herman Smestad-Samuelsen "Hi, a friend just showed me the new product red iPhone 7 plus and i wondered if you could make an stretch goal for a red case?" Hi! We don't plan to but we'll definitely think about it! @Tyler Walker "No joke, had a dream about this last night. Its a shame its not already in my hands. Here's to hoping the early subscribers get first dibs." The earlier you back, the faster get. @Dominique "This is a fantastic product, if it sells. The reason being is that I use a iPhone for work and Android to play, watch movies, etc. If this things has OTG, that is a big plus! I would not have to bring two phones with me all the time. This product would have both. So, this is great, hopefully we can make it to the $900,000, but either way I am glad they would add micro expandable storage." Thank you :) @tousif bandaly "Is it going to support 4g bands in india?" GSM: 850(B5)/900(B8)/1800(B3)/1900(B2) WCDMA: 850(B5)/900(B8)/1900(B2)/2100(B1) LTE FDD: 2100(B1)/1800(B3)/2600(B7)/800(B20) You should check with your carrier about the compatibility to those above. @William Young "Will it be possible to install 3rd party roms on the device, or will the bootloader be locked down. Also will it be possible to root the device? Also will the power bank add-on be charged? Will it need to be in the eye, or could it be charged externally." The bootloader won't be locked. Yes, it's rootable. You'll be able to charge it externally. @Sheikh Farhan Hummayun "Couple of suggestions... When stretch goal reach for 900k the capacity should move from 16gb to 256gb... not just 64gb.. Another suggestion is that the stretch goal for waterproofing seems impossible to reach, can you change that from 3 million to just 1 million... it will be easier to reach and I am sure people will agree to it and will surely buy the eye..." 256GB NAND storage is very expensive and hard to get. I see your point with the waterproofing, you should know that it's very complicated and expensive. We'll definitely consider it though. @PrizC "16GB​ onboard Is that UFS2.0? 300Mbps 4G It have 2CA right? How about 2CA combination? P20 chipset can support 4G+3G will you open it? It is very useful in many nations" Yes, UFS 2.0. It have 2CA. About your other inquiries, we'll need to check it more deeply. @Horace Cheng "What is the connection port spec? Will it be a USB type-C?" Lightning port. @Alex Kah "What a killer project! Thank you for not only the idea but for putting in the enormous effort to bring this to market! This literally changes everything and provides interesting competition and enhancements in the cellular marketplace. I currently carry both a iPhone 6S and a HTC Desire 530 running Android because of features I need in both on a regular basis so you will be freeing up some room in my pockets! I know you have noted numerous times to US based backers to check with their carrier to see if the bands you have identified... * GSM: 850(B5)/900(B8)/1800(B3)/1900(B2) * WCDMA: 850(B5)/900(B8)/1900(B2)/2100(B1) * LTE FDD: 2100(B1)/1800(B3)/2600(B7)/800(B20) ... are compatible with their service. My goal would be to use a different carrier than what I currently use to provide redundancy for cellular coverage. Could you please confirm at least one US carrier will be compatible with the Eye4G? I don't care which carrier it is(AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile or Sprint) but since I am not an expert in cellular bands and don't want to attempt to confirm something I don't know enough about it would be beneficial to all of the backers in the US to know which carrier will be supported. It is pointless for me to purchase the 4G version, which is what I am currently backing, without knowing for sure that at least one US carrier will work with the Eye4G. Again thanks for a great product. I am excited to use it!" The Eye 4G should work on ATT and TMobile. @William Young "When plugged into the computer will the computer see the iPhone, Eye, or both? I am really hoping that both can be seen as I want to use this for software development so that I no longer have to keep an android phone along with me all the time when working on cross platform apps." As for now, when connecting Eye to the computer, it'll recognize it as the Eye Android device only. We're thinking about giving the user an option to choose in the settings if it'll be recognized as Eye or iPhone, but we don't commit it. In any case, there won't be an option that both be recognized on the same connection. @Reece Darragh "In terms of OS will you be shipping with Android 7.1.2 as it is projected to come out in April which should give you some time to create a build before the August ship date. And in terms of OS updates does this mean you will provide future major android updates such as Android O (August projected release) and Android P (Obviously Android P would be in 2018) or will it just be security updates? Keeping up with major updates would be a great bonus to this project." The plans are to ship with 7.1. We offer support for 2 years of versions updates. We don't commit for the security updates. @navas "Oh oh, VoLTE is a deal breaker for me, Since I am in India I know everyone will be using VoLTE. How complicated is that to make it happen?" We'll check it. A good chance we'll support it. We'll update. @Sreekanth "@ESTI Any stretch goal plan to increase RAM on Eye to 4GB?" There are no plans for a stretch goal like this. @Shaheen Al Ghanim "i choose the family pack. Can i pick it for different iPhone like 2 iPhone 7 plus, one iPhone 7 and one iPhone 6" Yes. you'll have an option to choose. @Mohamad Kamsani "Whats the date for the Live Demo?" We didn't scheduled a date yet. @Ben Byers "@ESTI Inc. I think a lot of people don't understand that this is a SUB-DEVICE, NOT a full, fledged Android phone slapped on the back of an iPhone. This is NOT meant to be your daily driver. I LOVE what you've created here and can NOT WAIT to get it! I CONTINUALLY have a 2nd Android phone ready for me to hop into for half a day before I get angry and go back to my iPhone. This is the answer to my prayers! Android has SO MANY better things more than iPhone, but just isn't stable enough, nor does it have good enough battery for me. But this, this is just AMAZING! Keep up the great work! I, like a lot of people on here, REALLY APPRECIATE IT!!!" Thank you! :) @Steve F "Definitely looks like we'll get to the $500,000 stretch goal for the 7200 mAh battery but curious on if you have a prototype of that or a CAD drawing to show us backers on how it will look mounted. And surely hope we make it to the $900,000 stretch goal for the 64GB internal memory." We're working on it. @유희성 "Work 3G?" The 4G model supports also 3G. @Kenneth jackson "Greetings! My question is what is your progress on developing iPhone side software (app for integration), and what is your contingency plan if it's not accepted by apple? Also I know it's early but could you estimate how far from mass production ready the prototypes are?" Hi! We didn't start the software development for the iOS side yes. We did an endless research for 100% confirmation we follow all of Apple guidelines. we are three months from mass production. @John Liu "I had the $129 pledge for the 4G Eye and I wanted to get a WiFi Eye as well, but I accidentally changed my pledge to 2 4G Eye at $239. Is there any way to get my old pledge amount back and add the WiFi Eye? I wouldn't mind keeping the 2 4G Eye pledge if you have a more definite answer about supporting the bands I need for my carrier. I'm somewhat surprised that you don't support most US Carriers when I'm sure a majority of your backers are from the US." You've already sent us a message about it. We'll address it there :) @navas "Does it Supports VoLTE?" It doesn't supports VoLTE @Sreekanth "iPhone 8 is rumored to have wireless charging built-in. If so, how does it affect wireless charging on Eye or vice-versa?" The next iPhone will also be supported, instead of charging it via its own QI receiver it'll be charged via the Eye QI receiver. @FranSan "Thank you for your answer. I understand your view and maybe you are right (you thought about this project for à long time). If there is no way to upgrade de internal memory, I think I will cancel my pledge. I will Think about It. Internal memory is for app and external memory is for Data. I use lot of apps and 16GB is definitely not enough for me. But don't change your way, the Project is amazing." There's a very good chance we'll reach the 900K, and then you'll be able to upgrade to 64GB. @Terrel Williams "I agree with the creator. It's a second device/add on to your iPhone. 16 gigs with and expandable ad car option is plenty. Keep up the great work. I'm so looking forward to getting my eye! Will this be standard shipping or is there a way we can get like overnight shipping?" Thank you for supporting both financially and mentally ;) For now the shipping isn't an overnight shipping. We might offer it when it'll be relevant. @FranSan "To be honest, I don't care the powerbank. I have a lot or them. Half of streach goals are useless. Upgrading the internal memory is interesting and usefull. I can't do anything with 16GB. Who can ? 64GB is a minimum. 128GB would be great. I like the IP67 and the trial boot (Android, Ubuntu and Windows Phone) idea's. This would be the ultime smartphone for a geek (software développer). But, Your streach goals are to ambitiouse. So, no chance." The new idea of the power bank is that you stay with one device which is the Eye and transforming it to a mini Android device-power bank in one. Think about like you buy a fat Android device with a 10,000 mAh battery for charging other devices. About the 16GB storage, Eye is a sub device and have the micro SD card expansion up to 256GB so we though 16GB is very good, add to it that this is a Kickstarter and you don't want to charge too much because people are skeptical so a lower price will make you fill more convenient to back. The reason those stretch goals are so high is because they cost a fortune to develop in both software and hardware. This is only a Kickstarter and we have to be lean in order to supply everything in time and leave enough space for the 'Kick' to happen and grow to be a stable company. *Edit* @Bobby Yelland "Hello, I have a couple questions. I added $20 to my previous pledge, will that get me the wireless charger? Also I thought I saw a headphone jack in the case, if there is a headphone jack, will we be able to use it for the iPhone 7 and 7 plus?" Hi Yes, it gives you the wireless charger, at the end of the campaign you'll get a servery that will contains your reward and the charger and you'll need to choose a model and color of the Eye and address for shipping. Yes, this headphone jack will serve both the Eye and the iPhone. Btw. You can use Eye with a friend, play music for yourself on the iPhone and to your friend or child from the Eye with Bluetooth headphones :) @Bobby Yelland "Hello, I have a couple questions. I added $20 to my previous pledge, will that get me the wireless charger?

Hi Yes, it gives you the wireless charger, at the end of the campaign you'll get a servery that will contains your reward and the charger and you'll need to choose a model and color of the Eye and address for shipping. @Garek See "Hey am wondering for the extra batt part and 64 gb can we purchase it already ? I don't understand the part where by extra batt when not covering with eye ." Hi Not yet, only after will reach the relevant goals: 500K for battery bank add-on and 900K for 64GB of storage. The power bank works as a stand alone and when mounted inside the Eye case the Eye literally transforms to a mini-tablet-power bank @Jimmy Shadow "I'm looking at the LTE bands you support. None of the bands are Sprint compatible. Would you be able to add those bands so I can use my extra Sprint sim card in the Eye? Thanks." We'll try our best but as for now the final product will support those bands: GSM: 850(B5)/900(B8)/1800(B3)/1900(B2) WCDMA: 850(B5)/900(B8)/1900(B2)/2100(B1) LTE FDD: 2100(B1)/1800(B3)/2600(B7)/800(B20) @Sheikh Farhan Hummayun "Why not 256 gb for last stretch goal... make it the best product then..." Thanks for your suggestion! We'll consider it! @jaymn kelly "By the time this kickstarter ends will you support us 4g" We're doing our best to, but as for now the final 4G model bands will be: GSM: 850(B5)/900(B8)/1800(B3)/1900(B2) WCDMA: 850(B5)/900(B8)/1900(B2)/2100(B1) LTE FDD: 2100(B1)/1800(B3)/2600(B7)/800(B20) @Karan "What about one last stretch goal to add internal 128gb option at $59 or nearby?" We'll consider it, thank you for your suggestion :) @Harish Bysani Kodanda "Hi Team This is my first backing am thrilled, do all stretch goals need additional payment or is it just for 16 to 64 GB Upgrade" Thank you for choosing us for your first Kickstarter backing! When an additional support is required we mention it. @Tevan "I was wondering if it would be possible to come out with a model that completely encases the phone? Adding the screen protector to the case. Or would that option just be too costly to add om?" We're considering to make the iPhone side lip higher. There is no need for a screen protector for Eye's screen. @Francesco Dal Sacco "Question regarding the "battery case" function: is it going to be just a hardware feature (that is, you press a button and the case starts charging the iPhone) or there will be some kind of software management (like a dedicated menu setting where one can choose parameters like the % under which the case starts charging, the order in which the case and the iPhone are charged, ...)?" It'll be controlled by software. @PrizC "59 for 64gb Is that UFS2.1 or UFS2.0?" UFS 2.0 As I've mentioned before to replace/add a chip on the device board is costly. That's why it's sounds like too much. You can always just stick to the micro SD expansion. 16GB for a sub-device is also very good. @Forest "Also will it support companies like metro pcs, cricket etc." You'll need to check with them, those are the bands we support: GSM: 850(B5)/900(B8)/1800(B3)/1900(B2) WCDMA: 850(B5)/900(B8)/1900(B2)/2100(B1) LTE FDD: 2100(B1)/1800(B3)/2600(B7)/800(B20) @Forest "I have a question about the 4g Model. Can you use the eye as a mobile hotspot for the iPhone it's attached to?" Yes :) @Takuya Bando "Please add language to Japanese And add band19(4g)&band6(3G) I hope sucsess this plan Thank you" Hi We'll do our best to add Japanese. We can't add bands to the current ones: GSM: 850(B5)/900(B8)/1800(B3)/1900(B2) WCDMA: 850(B5)/900(B8)/1900(B2)/2100(B1) LTE FDD: 2100(B1)/1800(B3)/2600(B7)/800(B20) You're welcome @Sheikh Farhan Hummayun "I agree with others here that for 64gb an additional price of 59$ is too much.. If the stretch goals reach to 900,000$ so 64gb should be free... or you can put total 256gb internal memory then the cost may be ok.. but just for 64gb.. it's pretty high.." As I've mentioned before, to replace/add a chip on the device board is costly. That's why it's sounds like too much. You can always just stick to the micro SD expansion. 16GB for a sub-device is also very good. @Michael Schiefele "A question about the power bank stretch goal: When the power bank is mounted in, will there be a lightning to lightning connection to power the iPhone or what way do you chose to power the iPhone? Will there be an additional power cord in the equipment? A second question about the lightning port and support for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto: Usually when I connect my iPhone with my new OPEL INSIGNIA with CarPlay/Android Auto Support, the Phone will connect automatically with the entertainment system. When the iPhone and the Eye connecting over the same port, how can I choose which OS I want to use? Could you test it? If so, could you post a video? IMHO (car) connectivity is big selling point for the eye. thx again and big thx for answering all the backer question. (y) :-))" There will be two regular USB sockets to connect devices you want to charge. When the iPhone is mounted inside of the Eye and will be connected to the car, the CarPlay will be used. You are welcome :) @John Liu "Any option for additional storage? I'm willing to pay more for a 256GB! Also, will the 7 Plus case work with the 6s Plus? I current own both devices, but when the 8 comes out, I'll be selling my 7 Plus but keeping my 6s Plus as a backup/travel device. Lastly, can you make a bundle with 1 4G and 1 WiFi? I don't think I can wait that long for the iPhone 8 Eye. I'll get one for the 7 for now and wait for the 8!" As for now, we don't plan of adding for on-board storage. You can use a micro SD card of up to 256GB and take the model of 64GB if we'll reach the 900K goal, that's a huge amount of space. Yes, the Eye is the same for all Plus models. If you want do do such bundle you can add the reward amount of the relevant model to your current pledge. @navas "Thanks for considering my stretch goal request for the additional storage. We are all know that 900K is an easy stretch. But I am afraid the people won't be upgrading to 64G for an additional $ 59 since they are better off with SD card storage and it is cheap! I am not an expert but $ 59 is a lot of money you can almost bye a complete "eye" if you were an super early adopter. So my request is lower the the money and break it up with smaller storage like 32 & 64. This way people have less money will have a chance to upgrade their storage also I am sure double boot and triple boot (windows) will gonna need a hell lot of space than the 16GB." As I've mentioned before to replace/add a chip on the device board is costly. That's why it's sounds like too much. You can always just stick to the micro SD expansion. 16GB for a sub-device is also very good. For the same reason above as for now we can't add more models. @R Pooran Prasad "Can you detail out the differences on the functioning of Eye and Eye 4G on campaign page, so that it clears the confusion for many of them." Great idea! :) @Frickes "If my Eye is defect and destroys my iPhone will you replace both?" This should never happen. The iPhone has its own power protections. If it will, sure we'll have to replace both. @Sergio Espinoza "This is my first project I'm backing at Kickstart and I really think it's awesome! I got two quick questions: 1. It's the Eye screen always on? If so, wouldn't be useful to be able to turn it off for battery saving? 2. Any details on the standards required (bus speed, etc) for the external memory card? <url>" Thanks you for choosing us as your first backing! 1. The user can turn on/off the always on display feature. 2. Any modern micro SD card will be supported. @Varun "Why always ON display! Can't we turn it off whenever required? I don't get it! any explanation?" You can turn it on/off in the setting. @Ibby "While I'm happy about the update, I think that charging $60 for an upgrade to 64gb is extremely steep. Especially since the memory is expandable and SD cards are pennies on the dollar nowadays. Can you instead offer better processors or larger screen options for the 6+/6s+ as stretch goals? It just doesn't make sense to pay $60 for 64gb when a 64gm Micro SD card costs about $20" To replace a chip on the device board is costly. That's why it's sounds like too much. You can always just stick to the micro SD expansion. 16GB for a sub-device is also very good. For the same reason above as for now we can't add more models. @Karan "Additionally can you create one more stretch goal for Qualcomm Snapdragon Processor? Along with 3 options to choose the processing power. In this way people with tight budget will not left behind. Lastly what about a combined goal wherein you add "more internal space + Qualcomm" at discounted price?" Qualcomm processors are way out of our reach because you need to order a huge amount (hundreds of thousands) as a minimum order. @Karan "Thanks for adding 64gb as stretch goals with add-ons. $59 seems to be little costly. Can you modify that stretch goal to add options to choose between 32gb, 64gb and 128gb?" You're welcome! To replace a chip to the device board is costly. That's why it's sounds like too much. For the same reason above as for now we can't add more models. @Jinhua He "Hi I am curious regarding the battery. Does it serve as a battery pack when the iPhone is low on juice and there is no power outlets available. The second question is with regards to delivery, now that the project has reached its funding, is there an estimate when these products will start shipping? I am worried as I previously backed popslate which seemed promising but as per the news they failed to deliver to the backers. Thank you for your time" Hi Eye can charge the iPhone when the iPhone mounted inside it. As it says on the rewards, shipping will be at the end of August. We discussed about the popslate and why we can deliver and they don't. You can see below our discussion. @kokobin "Curious to know more details about Eye - does it generate its own hotspot (the android side) where wifi is not available?" With Eye 4G you can use the Eye as a hotspot. @Jasonbo4 "Hello! Quick Question, will there be an option to choose when you want the case to charge your iPhone, even when the case is on?" Hi Yes :) @Trystan Vel "I have a question that probably already got asked, I have an iPhone 7 plus, what if this thing gets dropped and falls right on your screen?" Eye's screen is protected by a higher lip, just like the Casio G-Shock watches. You can see more on the page, it's almost in the bottom of it. @Trenton Bledsoe "Hi! I have a quick question. So I know that the eye has no speakers, so if you want to watch a video and you don't have headphones would the sound be sent and played through the iPhone's speakers? Thank you very much!" Hi! That's right :) @Woo Jae Lee "How many languages will be supported on eye's android?" Great question! English, Bahasa Indonesia, Bahasa Melayu, Cestina, Dansk, Deutsch, Espanol, Filipino, French, Hrvatski, latviesu,lietuviu,Italiano, Magyar, Nederlands, Norsk, Polish, Portuguese, Romana, Slovencina, Suomi, Svenska, Tieng viet, Turkish, Greek, Bulgarian, Russian, Ukrainian, Hebrew, Arabic, Thai, Khmer, Korean, Simplified/Traditional Chinese @Wouter Tenger-Geurtz "I have a 24Gb data subscription on my iPhone. Will Eye - or vice versa for that matter - be able to use this bundle instead of having to get another data bundle?" Yes. When no WiFi available: Eye - The iPhone's cellular data connection will supply the internet connection to Eye but not via hotspot because it consumes a low of power, but via BLE. Eye 4G- The iPhone's cellular data connection will supply the internet connection to Eye but not via hotspot because it consumes a low of power, but via BLE. You can also add a sim with data plan and also connect with it. When WiFi is available: Eye/Eye 4G will connect to it, just like the iPhone does. @mohammad murad "may i know what is the device that can be compared to eye? the closest " I don't know this kind of device. @Aaron Mcilvain "Not my first backing but it's been some of the most entertaining back and forth dialogue between a cool product and it's wary would-be supporters, count me in!" Thank you Aaron! @Vyas "Can I know how heavy will the final device be?" For iPhone 6, 6s, and 7 3.5 ounces (90 grams) For iPhone 6 Plus, 6s Plus, and 7 Plus 3.25 ounces (98 grams) @Jay M. W. Ice "If you want to hit 3 million you might need to add more early birds" You're right! We'll update it. Thank you! @kokobin "Gorilla Glass?" We don't commit to add a Gorilla glass although it'll be also a tempered glass. @Jeff Sooley "The rumour is that apple is not useing lightning connector in the 8 if this happens I assume this we'll be addressed in the 8 version of the case!" We do know about this rumor. This rumor is probably isn't true, but we'll prepare ourselves. Thank you. @Jeff Sooley "all the items you mentioned like wireless charging screen size dual sim.. are they all included in the price or are they stretch goals are extra money?" They all included with the exception of the dual SIM card slots which is included only in the 4G model. @navas "I would prefer increasing inbuilt storage (16GB) as a stretch goal. Since I wanted to use all 3 sims. I believe it is a hybrid sim right? Also, Mediatek always suffers performance issue. I know Qualcomm costs more, but I think it will be better than Mediatek." This is a good suggestion for a stretch goal! We'll write it down and think about it! Yes, you can't insert two SIMs and a micro SD card in the same time. In order to implement a Qualcomm processor, we need to manufacture in a whole different scale than we plan to do now, it's also needs much more funds that we don't have. @Jeff Sooley "I backed this but well most likely get a iphone 8 in the future well you be making a case for this?" The next iPhone will be supported a month after its launch. An option to wait until Eye for the next iPhone is out will be given to backers. @Jeff Sooley "well it have dual sim card or extra storage?" Extra storage will be for all models. Cellular connectivity with a dual sim card slot will be only in the Eye 4G. @Jeff Sooley "How basic well the android side be? I mean well it compare to samsung 8?" Eye case won't have the power of the Galaxy S8. The OS will be smooth and run very fast though. @Lauren Ashley Coleman "This is my first project I'm backing (very excited about this btw). How long do we have to pick a model and color after the survey comes?" Thank you for choosing us for your first backing! We don't know yet. When we'll send you the surveys we'll also let you know this detail. @Trystan Vel "Can someone answer me a really basic probably stupid question. It doesn't go into very much in the details for the campaign so I guess I have 2 questions. If the phone has 4G what is the big difference between an eye that has 4G vs one that does not? Also, what is the lazor game and what does it entail?" The main and only difference between the basic and the 4G model is the SIM card slots. Some uses of the additional sim cards: More numbers.. A data dedicated SIM for a hotspot to your laptop or even for your iPhone if the data plan has been used. @John H. Halpern, M.D. "Let's say you watch Netflix on that beautiful screen on the Eye side...how much view time until the battery dies? You don't have a side micro-USB in addition to Qi-charging, do you and why not??? Basically, my point is you can't use the Eye while it needs to charge. Battery is small so my guess is less than 1 hour of viewing streaming video but one can't even use an accessory portable battery or a wired charge cable to keep things going. In short, I encourage you to add this functionality." On the prototype we reached something like 6 hours of video playback on 50% brightness and without charging the iPhone. The lightning port will also be used to charge the Eye. You can play and still charge at the same time. @Harrison buckley "kicktraq says if you keep your momentum you'll get a low 1,500,000 or a high of 3 mil plus" Yes!! Isn't it crazy?? @Michael Schiefele "Hi folks, you got me support this project, so shut up and take my money! :D But all jokes aside! I've changed from the Super Early Bird non 4G to Early Bird 4G + 20$ for the wireless charger. Hopefully you'll be able to deliver a finished product. :-) Just a dumb question more: Is there a chance, that you'll officially support Google Daydream? Would it be possible to start a poll with the community hear? I would love a Google Daydream Support in the final product!!! THX and all the best for our project! :-)" Thank you :) We have plenty of work on the Eye and the supported features in our project so we can't technically work in the current budget on another new features. @dion "what different tge wireless charger accessory than Q wireless charger already in the market?" It's the same technology. Others doesn't support the green indicator to let you know the battery is fully charged. @Roderick Cowie "How does one add the wireless charger accessory to pledge?" When you pledge, you need to add $20 to the total sum of the reward. You can do it also after you pledge, just add $20 to your pledge. @Jay M. W. Ice "1) I don't think you will ever reach 3,000,000 if you don't add more early birds because if they need to pay the normal price for the case they might as well wait for it to come out, especially considering you hit your 300,000 goal. Additionally you might want to write on the home page of your product that if you hit 3,000,000 you will water proof it." It's mentioned in our stretch goals section. @Jay M. W. Ice "Unfortunately for me the difference between 129$ and 149$ for me is big as I am in high school and all the money to spend is the money I make by working at my synagogue every week and I only make 20$ a week." I'm sorry to hear that. I'm now even more appreciate your backing! Thank you! @Vidur Tangri "Hi, First of all, congratulations on a great project! I just had a few questions: 1. If I am using Whatsapp/snapchat on my iphone, will I be able to configure Eye to use the same account as my iphone as well? 2. Does Eye (not Eye 4G) have Wifi capabilities? Will it be able to cellular services of my iPhone? Thank you." Hi Thank you! 1. Unfortunately no. 2. Ye and yes :) @Jay M. W. Ice "Also I did 95$ donation then started thinking and realized I would be out of country next year so having the sim card would be very handy but the 129$ for the sim card slot was already out so o couldn't change it" I'm sorry to hear that. You can still get it in $149 which is much much less than the retail which is $229. @Jay M. W. Ice "Will it be waterproof, Also could you add in a speaker" 1) Although Eye has only one weakness point in terms of water resistance which is the Lightning port, it isn't water resistant. It takes a little design change and therefore more budget. The Eye will be water resistant only if we'll be able to reach 3,000,000 goal. 2) We can't add a speaker. The lack of a speaker is one of the reasons we were able to make Eye so thin. @John Wilfong "My iPhone uses Verizon will I be able to use ATT on the Eye? I pledged for 4G. In earlier comments you state you do not have LTE in the US but do have 3G. Please keep us informed on fixing this. Can you connect two earphones? One in the earphone jack and one in the lightning jack? How complete is the software side? I backed one project that is now two months in on getting approval to be placed in the App Store. What functionality will be lost if Apple doesn't approve the app that needs to run on the iOS side for eye to fully work?" 1)You'll probably be able to use ATT, but it's better if you check with them about our supported bands: GSM: 850(B5)/900(B8)/1800(B3)/1900(B2) WCDMA: 850(B5)/900(B8)/1900(B2)/2100(B1) LTE FDD: 2100(B1)/1800(B3)/2600(B7)/800(B20) 2) Yes, we're making a video about the dual playback. You and your friend can enjoy different music from one device using the Eye. You're hoping to upload it soon. 3) The software side needs some more major development, this is one of the reasons of why we run this campaign. I do can say that all of our software and hardware features follow Apples guidelines. 4) This can't happen, we follow all of their rules. @Harrison buckley We use only common smartphones and cases though materials. We don't taking risks for using special unpopular materials. @Woo Jae Lee "This case looks like no speaker. It is possible with non-speaker to play music or something? Also it do not have any iphone's speaker hole." Since Eye doesn't have a mic or speaker, it'll use the iPhone's own mic and ear speaker. You can also use the headphone jack. The Eye do have speakers holes for the iPhone speaker and mic. @Horace Cheng "Maybe I missed the spec but what is the materials for the screen? It will have NFC/ metal plate for mount/ wireless charging, which all means we hv to tap the device with the screen down. So it have to be made with a very good materials to make it feasible n promising." The screen will be covered with tempered glass. Still, no protection is needed for Eye's screen! Just like the famous Casio G-Shock watch, Eye's bezels are above the screen, keeps the screen safe from drops and scratches. @Karan "Just a humble request to add additional stretch goal (with add-on) to increase the internal storage to 64gb." Thanks for your great suggestion! We'll definitely write it down and consider it! @Mohammad Fadin "Hi guys! Just backed up the project. How can I choose the case for iPhone 7 not 7 Plus?" Hi! At the end of the campaign you'll get a survey asking you to choose a model, color and address. @Chonnawat Eklapphaibun "Hi, I'm recently backed the one project similar to this but their technology is e-ink. (popslate2) Their project is now fail to deliver us and left with us getting nothing. I find your project might be a little complicated than that. Can you make us sure that you wont use the money that you get to all stupid research and give us excuse that you do not have enough money blah blah and wont deliver us in the future...." That is a very good question! First, you should notice Poplate run their campaign on Indiegogo, they didn't even make it to Kickstarter, they didn't have a working prototype that's looks similar to the final product like we do. Secondly, from what I see, they needed to develop some software to run their hardware, a little OS. This is a tough thing to do, very hard and challenging. We're taking Android because it's a stable and almost ready to use, especially when our chosen manufacturer has make and still is a lot of Android smartphones with almost identical hardware and software Eye will have, with some changes that are required for the Eye. All of our materials and electronics is already exist in mass production by chip makers for the smartphones market, we don't need to develop something totally from scratch like they do. @Markrhey Navea "Good day. I just wanted to know that if i opted to go for the upcoming iphone 8, but later changed my mind to go for lower model cases, would you allow me to change that? Thank you." As long as you didn't submit the survey with your device model and just waited, you can choose in the future whatever device. So all the ones that are not sure whether they getting the iPhone 8 or not, should choose to wait and not choose a specific model until they'll be 100% sure. @Grace "Will the finish of the case be of beter quality. Looking at the photos now it looks very cheap ...." It'll be in much much better quality and stronger materials. The dimensions though, won't change. @Vyas "Will the Eye 4g have a hotspot/tethering feature to share its internet?" Yes :) @Djayawarman Alamprabu "Lou Unbox Therapy has uploaded me what I wanted to see from the prototype. Great job @Eye creator. All the best with the product and hopefully we will get in on time." We're glad to hear Lou's video helped you :) @Gaurav Sehgal "@ Gaurav 1) Does it Support Fast Charging by using 3rd party fast chargers? 2) What about the warranty, Repair parts and service center in India.?" 1. We don't commit to fast charging support. 2. Warranty will be given by sending us the bad device and we'll send it back fixed. @Nathan Riddell "Great item if you can put it together! Tough job though exciting enough to take a punt :) My question is why super early bird backers have a September est. delivery for 4g Eyes and early birds (i.e. Later backers) have august? I think both of these may be ambitious ;) but happy to wait if it works well" Thank you :) We plan to ship all rewards until the end of August. There was a mistake with the September one and didn't fix it in time, now we can't fix it because at least one backer chose it and Kickstarter don't allow us to change and they have a good reason for that. *@Warpath "Have you guys thought of going down a per phone basis along with mass producing iPhone compatible ones? What can be done for people who have HTC, LG, Samsung, Nokia...etc? I personally have a Lumia 950xl." We thought about supporting the Galaxy S7 Edge, but it was to much work for us. We focus on the iPhones only and don't have plans* for other devices. *for now @Warpath "Have you guys thought of going down a per phone basis along with mass producing iPhone compatible ones? What can be done for people who have HTC, LG, Samsung, Nokia...etc? I personally have a Lumia 950xl." We thought about supporting the Galaxy S7 Edge, but it was to much work for us. We focus on the iPhones only and don't have plans for other devices. @Warpath "Some corporate emails require the touch sensor to unlock the phone. How would that work with the smart case?" Eye doesn't have a fingerprint reader. @Warpath "I don't think I conveyed my question correctly. Can the non-4G model make phone calls with the same phone number on the Sim card in the iPhone?" Hi! No, the phone number that's on the iPhone is used by the iPhone only. Don't see a reason to enable phone calls from the Eye using the iPhone SIM, you already have the iPhone for that! :) @David Zucker "Creator- Good Afternoon. Would the case be able to get Google Daydream certification?" Hi David! As for now, there are no plans to support Google Day Dream. @BOYBOI "Hi, just curious if I can use either android pay or apple pay while using the EYE case? Thanks in advance." You'll be able to use Apple Pay of course. We don't commit to support Android Pay, we still have NFC support though. ****We're here!!!*** We'll answer all of your question asap!!! We've been featured in Unbox Therapy!! @Steve F "Hoping we can get some video regarding the SIM card slots and SD card slot along with Pics/video of what some of the backers are requesting . And is there a way to add blue case as a stretch goal? Keep up the great work!!!" Our current prototype doesn't have the SIM card slots. We're planning to go live with Eye in a few days! Then all of you will be able to ask us anything :) @Kode Williams "I backed the product but I would really like to get it early to unbox and review it on my YouTube channel." Our backers will get the Eye before everyone! Also the earlier you back the earlier you'll receive :) @Bernard Arthur "Hi genuis,i backed the eye 4g and would like to know more about it. Il the size fix with my iPhone 7 Plus?" Yes :) @Horace Cheng "Just wonder with Eye, do Apple Pay still works?" Yes :) @Sheikh Farhan Hummayun "Couple of questions... 1. It's written that when using eye , iPhone will be on stand by mode... Explain that please.... Can we use both simultaneously? 2. The eye 4g doesn't have a speaker and a mic... if I attach it with your power bank (when it's unlocked)... what would be the use of It... only surf the internet ? Because eye itself can't receive a call or take pictures...." 1. You can use both at the same time if you want. We just mentioned that in terms of battery, general use is one screen so the other doesn't consume power. 2. When using the Eye as a stand alone, you'll see the incoming call and we'll be able to answer but to talk you'll need to use a headset with mic. Now that you've mentioned it, we are writing down a better solution that will use the iPhone hardware wirelessly, then you won't need an external hardware. We can't commit this will be in the final version of Eye, it takes a very hard software development work for it to work. @今津真之介 "when choose color black or white?" After the campaign will end, you'll get a survey asking you about the iPhone model, color and address. @Ariane "Just to clarify, does Eye include a charger?" Eye's box doesn't include a charger. @April Dámaso "Is there a drop test we can see? The case looks like it's made of cheap gummy material from the videos and pictures." A drop test isn't relevant as the Eye is a prototype now. The final material will be different, much stronger and solid and therefore will also look better. @Harrison buckley "forbes said something interesting what if you dont get google certification what is your backup plan? it says you plan on using UMI but apparently not all of their phones get accepted. so really big question what is you backup os?" He didn't said that their phones didn't got accepted. Most of the phones for the chinese market are without the Google Play services. Those Phones didn't even brought to Google for getting certified. Any device they wanted the Google Play services for, they got it. @Warpath "I understand you will be able to make calls from the model with the 4G card because of the simcard slot but what about the non-4G edition? Any way to BLE that?" When no WiFi available: Eye - The iPhone's cellular data connection will supply the internet connection to Eye but not via hotspot because it consumes a low of power, but via BLE. Eye 4G- The iPhone's cellular data connection will supply the internet connection to Eye but not via hotspot because it consumes a low of power, but via BLE. You can also add a sim with data plan and also connect with it. When WiFi is available: Eye/Eye 4G will connect to it, just like the iPhone does. @Harrison buckley ""The Kickstarter campaign says the first units will deliver in August of 2017, a timeline that's likely going to be difficult to meet, so if you're interested in this product, it may be better to hold off until it is available outside of Kickstarter." this is what Macrumor said which makes sense i dont expect an august release more hoping for it" "And I pray im not wrong but to have a working prototype shows a working product and only need funding to mass produce. I hope they clean some lines maybe redesign a little to help with mass production but it seems like the money has already been spent for designing" Our manufacturer is very good at what he does and he have done great smartphones projects as schedule. Please read the 'Risks and challenges' section at the end of the campaign page for more. @Fran Ramos Sanchez "Hi Creator. You considerate to do in the future one mix like iPhone iOS + Smartphone like Spen Edition (Galaxy Note) Would be awesome guys to have one iPhone with Spen + Air Command software!!! I will fell in love with that!" Hi We'll write it down as we didn't even thought about this kind of configuration. @german g Many websites including macrummors suggest it's too good to be true and they do not recommend backing this kickstarter project. Should we be worried ? We did a lot of research before we even decided to go for this campaign. We're standing behind our campaign promises in 100%. We even have a fully working prototype. We're here to answer any specific question you guys have, it's hard to handle with 'too good to be true', please specify and we shall refer it. @Charles Turner "Hello, I was wondering if you guys are going to release an easy root tool along with the case and if not how are we going to go about rooting it?" We're thinking about shipping it with an option of root built in under the developer option. We want to give the full Android experience. In case we won't I think we'll probably give instructions how to. @Mohamad Kamsani "Hi, cant wait to see Unbox Therapy review your prototype! I do have have a few questions, will there be an option to opt for better specs? Anything close to a Google Pixel maybe? What are your policies on refunds? Should the product get delayed way beyond expected delays or unsatisfactory use of The Eye? I wish you success and hope you exceed the $15 million stretch goal so we can boot into Ubuntu and Windows 10 Mobile on top of iOS and Android. That would be exciting if anything." Hi To get specs like the Pixel you need to use components with much higher price tag. Additionally, You need to order at least a million units and find a very big manufacturer, big enough for Qualcomm even talk with him about supplying her SOCs to him. Kickstarter is a platform to support creators make their product alive and available for the public. You're supporting our project to mass produce the Eye and getting a reward for your support. We'll use your backing only for the project success and make the Eye a reality asap and ship to you a great and finished product. We follow and will follow all Kickstarter rules, as they mentioned here: <url>#faq_41853 @Philip T "What will happen if the next iPhone has wireless charging? Will your wireless charging interfere with the built in charging? Will the case for the next iPhone drop wireless charging if they have their own? If they do have their own wireless charging what if your case interferes with it?" The next iPhone wireless charging won't work but the Eye wireless charge it in the same way. @german gutierrez "What are the specs of the internals? Cpu ? Ram? Etc" You can see all of the specs info at the bottom of the campaign page. @Keiths This is quite confusing.. "1) so by default, this have got 2 different battery life? My iPhone has its own independent battery, while the eye has its own independent battery? 2) however, when charging, both will be charged together? 3) the eye can also be used as a supplementary battery charger for my iPhone? This sounds Abit too good to be true right? If so, what the radiation readings gonna be like? I'm worried that this could be quite harmful?" 1) Yes, there are two batteries. Eye's battery is charging the iPhone while the iPhone never charges Eye's battery. 2)Yes. 3)When not connected to a charger, Eye will charge the iPhone battery, just like any other battery case. Why is it too good to be true? We didn't checked the radiation levels, but it's just like charging an iPad next to an iPhone. @Lauren Ashley Coleman "How can I use my iPhone number without switching my SIM card back and forth" You don't need to insert a sim card to get internet connection. Eye will use the iPhone data connection, but not via potshot because it consumes a lot of power. Via, BLE. @George Soong "Would love to have the case designed so that regardless which side is face down, the glass will not rub against the surface." A big mount of our backers are wanting this, we'll probably make the top and bottom areas in the side of the iPhone screen, little higher so even in face down the iPhone screen won't touch the surface. We can't commit to that, but we'll probably make it that way. @Xavier Sierra Planell "When you connect the Eye to your iPhone, you can choose if the case charge or not the iPhone? Because if the case always are charging the iPhone, the battery of the iPhone will decrease its battery life.." By default, when you charge through the port of the Eye, both devices will be charged simultaneously (regular charge and not iPhone from the case battery). @Anton Jalil "Are we given the option to choose a 7 or 7plus?" At the end of the campaign you'll get a survey asking you to choose a model, color and address. @Bobby Yelland "Where is the video Introducing the eye case? I have been scrolling through comments and can not find it." It's on campaign page. You can also check out our YouTube channel for them for even more videos: <url>"Could I and how could I use the USB data port of the unit? (For example, ADB or even OTG function)" Yes, you can! Eye is even a stand alone Android device, we can use it even if the iPhone isn't mounted inside of it. So like any other Android device, you can use the USB data port for ADB, files transfer and OTG. @Dac "I backed this, but let's be real, this *has* to be fake, right? The sum of its parts, even at wholesale price, exceeds $150. Then consider the form factor, and apparently cramming a 2600mah battery in there... there's just no way. I hope it's real, I really do. But this absolutely seems like a scam. Prove it's real by providing a video with a working demo." Hi Dac! Thank you for backing our project. Eye's electronics and internals costs little less than $50, there's also some more Dollars for: Software- hardware development and assembles. All of our page is full of video demos, especially the prototype gallery and also we'll go live very soon and you'll be able to ask all of your question and we'll demonstrate all of the working features in real time. ****Very important**** We're really trying to do our best to answer all of your questions here and in the ones in private messages. Please try to understand us, those are very crazy days for us and we are grateful to all of you! We'll continue answering and make all efforts to do that. @Keven "Would we get to select the phone size after the 30 days?" After the campaign will end, you'll get a survey asking you about the iPhone model, color and address. @Jules DjHaitianboss "Hey dear, I would like to know if the 4G version is unlocked meaning, I can use any other cellular company that use SIM card like (t-mobile, ATT, simple mobile......?" Yes, just check with your carrier for the bands compatibility: GSM: 850(B5)/900(B8)/1800(B3)/1900(B2) WCDMA: 850(B5)/900(B8)/1900(B2)/2100(B1) LTE FDD: 2100(B1)/1800(B3)/2600(B7)/800(B20) @Roberto Greco "In a previous answer you said that the 95$ early bird doesn't have any SIM cards slot. Does it have WiFi at least? How could I install Play Store apps if it doesn't have any connection at all?" Yes, it have WiFi :) SIM cards support is the only difference between the two. @Nigor "Hello, the pack will be waterproof ? or shock absorbing ? i'm so patient to see your project came true :)" As for now, Eye isn't water resistant, if we'll reach 3 million Dollars goal then we'll be able to add IP67 certification. As of shock absorbing, can tell you that the Eye is very rugged and will protect your iPhone, especially the production units, they will be much more strong and solid. @Johan Krüger Haglert "I missed the part about 4G vs not. There won't be a way to switch between the early bird offers of each kind? I took the $95 one but maybe the $129 is better, the $95 doesn't have any cellular connectivity at all? The sim cards isn't a thing in it I assume?" No SIM slots on the non-4G model. Until the end of the campaign you can always cancel your pledge and select another reward. @Johan Krüger Haglert "I'm kinda skeptical about how feasible this product is to produce at that price point. At the closer to €200 then sure it become easier. (Also I have no iPhone but whatever.. I'm here to watch and take early-bird offers :D) Anyway, I'm also a vegan and definitely want to stinking leather case. If it was an optional then then that would be better. I don't want it. I don't want it produced. I don't want it mixed with a product of mine. As an add-on accessory sure. As something included then having an option to have something else than a leather one would had been nice." We did a lot of research about manufacturing and software developing cost for this project. The reward price and the campaign goal will guarantee supplying Eye to are backers and Kick start our company for further production. @Xundong Xin "Hello, my model is iphone6s, I bought $ 129, how can I choose models, where to fill in the delivery address, I was in China, is not a good $ 22 freight after it?" At the end of the campaign you'll get a survey asking you to choose model, color and address. @Omar Khan "Hi - What internal RAM does android phone has ?" Eye isn't exactly a phone, it has a model with some cellular capabilities but still isn't a phone. The RAM on Eye board is 3GB @Noah Duel "Is Wireless charging already included in the case or is it something extra that you have to purchase for the case?" Wireless charging receiver is inside the Eye. For charging wireless, you need a wireless charger. Check out the page campaign and you'll find the charger and an explanation on how to get it. @Pichvyda Tuy "Hi, Does the Early bird edition come with 4G connectivity? Or does it support only the GSM ones?" Only rewords mentioning 4G have cellular connectivity. @Ricson "Thanks for the response. Can we have a demo on that? I believe this can be checked by using the camera app. Using the + button should allow you to take photos which means that the volume control and microphone of a 3.5mm jack should be working" Right now the prototype doesn't have the software to manage those connections. It'll definitely will be in the production model. @n4l62hgdf "Sorry for my specific questions, but your answer remains still unclear in some parts to me. Could you specify what you mean by "The user will need to choose between charging only state of one of the devices trough Eye interface." Do you mean by this that you just can select which battery is being charged when power is plugged-in? Is it not possible to charge both batteries automatically? So ADB / debugging mode is not possible?" Charging - Both batteries will be charged at the same time. Data - including ADB / debugging mode is for the case only. If you want to sync data between your computer and the iPhone, you'll need to remove the iPhone from the case and connect the Lightning cable straight to it. @David Williford "What kind of Wifi speed will come standard with the EYE?" Eye's WiFi chip supports a/b/g/n/ac. @Mike Pak "Is screen mirroring of the Android screen possible through the lightning port?" Yes, and there's also another method via AirPlay client. **EDIT** @Djayawarman Alamprabu "Hi creator some of my friend that I've shown the working Eye prototype video told me that why in the video there is no actual putting the case on to the iPhone before showing the EYE to function. The video can just be a another phone attach to the iPhone I.e not an actual case. Can you please upload the case with out the iPhone working as it is and then attach to the iPhone and show how the screen can be used as a selfie monitor. Thanks" You guys have a lot of video requests :) We plan to go live very soon and everybody are invited to take part and ask questions :) @Djayawarman Alamprabu "Hi creator some of my friend that I've shown the working Eye prototype video told me that why in the video there is no actual putting the case on to the iPhone before showing the EYE to function.

Can you please upload the case with out the iPhone working as it is and then attach to the iPhone and show how the screen can be used as a selfie monitor. Thanks" You guy have a lot of requests :) We plan to go live very soon and everybody are invited to take part and ask questions :) @Javier buendia "So for the non-4G version will there be some type of Bluetooth or wifi connection?" Of course! :) @n4l62hgdf " I'm curious about the lightning port of the case. Is it possible to use it as Android Debug Bridge (adb), respectively mass storage device for the internal SD card? Or is it just for charging the battery?" The user will need to choose between charging only state of one of the devices trough Eye interface. @Reece Darragh "In terms of debugging options since the Eye will connect via the lightning port is there any options for USB android debugging? Would the Eye be able to use the lightning cable for debugging/ ADB / Flashing ROMs etc... If this is the case how will you prevent driver conflicts with iTunes and the iPhone?" The user will need to choose between charging only state of one of the devices trough Eye interface. @Benjamin Ningoo "Does the super early bird also have sim card slots as I see other levels of pledge which say 4g connectivity??" No, but they can add $34 when they make the pledge and get the 4G one. @Marc HERVE "So impatient to get this project in hands. I do not like the android version of Samsung but love the top layer developped by Xiaomi. It is for me the best one. Will it be possible to install it instead of the standard android one? Thank you" The Eye is like any other Android device. @Ricson "I have a question around MFi as well. Several other products that tried to add a 3.5mm port were not allowed to carry voice inputs over 3.5mm headphones. Will you be restricted by this as well? This is my only main concern as I find it extremely bothersome to be always choosing my voice input device on every call on bluetooth." You've made a good point. To overcome a few engineering challenges, Eye will probably need to connect to the iPhone also via Bluetooth Low Energy so we'll be able to take care of this issue too. @Richard He made the video only today. Lets be patient. It's not that simple to be featured on Unbox Therapy, especially if you're not sponsoring the video. @Garek See "Hey, where would I got the notification of what phone my casing will be?" At the end of the campaign you'll receive an email with a survey asking about the model, color and address. @R Pooran Prasad "Loving it.. Btw, in the design, can you give a slight bump just the way you have done for android part.. so that even it screen falls flat, the bump protects the iphone screen? 2-3mm bump is good, to avoid dirt on the surface to stick on iphone side." Thank you :) We're definitely considering it. We got this request from some of our backers. @Kenny Zhong "Any plans to have an independent third party reviewer demonstrate a prototype within 30 days of the Kickstarter? I personally feel a more extensive showcase of the functionality should be shown instead of the broken up testing and advertisement just to take away the concerns of those on the fence about backing." We've sent a prototype to a famous YouTuber, he made a video. We hope he'll upload it, if not, we'll send also to others. @Richard Shillington Thank you for your detailed comment. About your inquiries: 1. MFi- it isn't a dedicated port for another device than iOS, it's mainly and firstly for the iPhone. 2. There will be an app that'll run on the iOS side that will manage all Eye-iPhone communications. 3. About the HDMI video out, we do need to research more about it specifically, as this is only one method to mirror the camera screen. The other one is via AirPlay. If things will be problematic with the HDMI method, we'll go with the AirPlay. We did a lot of researching and testing before going live with this campaign :) @Jin he "When can I get this?" Shipping will start at the end of August. @Sam "Which screen protector for the eye smart android" You can see the protection section on the campaign page. The Eye doesn't need a screen protector. @Mike Pak "If the Android display is always on, is the touch screen active while in "standby"? If not, what causes it to wake?" A press on the home button will wake Eye up, just like the first video in our prototype gallery: <url>#prototype-slide-42623 @Ibby "Super excited to receive this product! I'm really hoping you can consider making a larger screen size for the 6s+/7+. There's tons more room for a larger screen!" You are correct! There's a lot of room for a larger screen, but because it's a Kickstarter project we want to keep things lean and going with one electronic model for both. @Hussein Bathabi "the Eye it have slot sim card without 4G ?" The Eye without 4G doesn't has the sim slots. @Benjamin Raffle Thanks for cheering everybody :) @Jeffrey Chan "May I ask that will this case supported for dual SIM card duo standby ?means can we use eye 4g cellular to make cake phone " Yes, you'll be able to make a phone call with the other sim cards. @Evan Lefevre "I'm in! I think this project is amazing but please, give us updates every 3 weeks! I think it's important to keep the trust of the community. I admit I have some doubts about this projet for some reasons. The first, and the biggest, is the $500.000 stretch goal. Dudes, seriously, a 10000mAh battery ?! Go on Google or Amazon and look at the size/weigh of these batteries! It's absolutely not possible to put a 10000mAh battery on this case with these specs... The second is, in your videos of the prototype gallery, I noticed that we never see uses of the Eye and the iPhone at the same time. I mean, we see both screens turned on at the same time, but there are never used together in the same video. Maybe I'm a bit paranoid, but I learnt with many fakes on Kickstarter to be careful about the details of amazing projects. Good luck team!" Thank you Evan! We will send updates about progress all the time. You should read the description about the power bank, it's an external power bank the can be mounted into Eye. If it's so important to you, I've just added a video showing me using both sides specially for you :) <url>çer "similar question to below: i see on videos that both iphone and second screen are opened. Do we have to wake up iphone screen in order to power android side/screen?" Nope. @Anthony Lee Yes, the screen is independent and running Android. You can choose whether to also mirror the iPhone screen for the back camera selfies. Those are the processor specs: MediaTek Helio P20 (MT6757) CPU 2.3 GHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 1.6 GHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 ​ Hi Steve! We'll give you guys an updates of the progress, of course. There's a very very tiny lip. On the iOS side there is nothing to show right now because the app hasn't been developed yet. It is possible to upload videos of a person playing on the Android side. We'll do it soon if you guys want. You can see this video of me playing for now: <url>"Will the wireless charging actually charge the iPhone or just the secondary screen?" The wireless charging will charge both iPhone and Eye simultaneously. @Alex Vazquez "Stupid question but does the basic model have wifi?" Yes, the basic model have wifi. @Choung Gukjong "Don't you have any plan for ipod? Actually i don't have iPhone but i have ipod 6th gen Why don't you trying to make eye for ipod?" Unfortunately we don't plan to make Eye for iPod, @Gauthier "I just have a suggestion. If the project exceeds its goals (which is quite certain already) would it be possible to make the eye for iPhone compatible with the fingerprint? This would really be something that would certainly attract a lot of people." Thank you for your suggestion. We'll need to check if it possible technologically. @Kevin "Since the Iphone does not support wireless charging at this point and the Eye does, does that mean the case has an integrated lightning connection to charge when connected with a wireless charging dock?" When the iPhone will be mounted inside Eye, the wireless charging will charge also the iPhone via the lighting port of the iPhone. @Anice Ramoly "Are there any hardware differences between the Eye cases for the 5.5" Plus iphones and the 4.7" iphones? like the screen size or battery capacity? Thanks" There are no differences. @Oxydjen "Hi there, will the 4G for France be supported? Thanks :)" Yes, the 4G for France will also be support. For safety, please check the frequencies Eye will use in the specs section. @Benjamin Raffle "So excited that this campaign is rising so steadily. I haven't been more excited about a potential product purchase since the Nintendo Wii all those years ago. Let's keep this rolling, really want this thing!" Thank you! @Gary Poon "Hi, what are the bands supported in 4G version?" GSM: 850(B5)/900(B8)/1800(B3)/1900(B2) WCDMA: 850(B5)/900(B8)/1900(B2)/2100(B1) LTE FDD: 2100(B1)/1800(B3)/2600(B7)/800(B20) @Ariane "What's the difference between 4G and non-4G? Can't we just put the 4G sim in the second sim slot? Is wireless charging the only way to charge the EYE and phone?" A non-4G model don't have a cellular connectivity. @John Liu You should see the specs now as the final specs. If there will be a change we'll update. @Terrel Williams "When do we specify what model we need i.e for the iPhone 7 for myself personally or the 6s? Will that effect the date we receive them?" After the campaign will end, you'll get a survey asking you about the iPhone model, color and address. @John Liu It dosen't support USA LTE yet, we'll try to work this out with our manufacturer. It do supports 3G in the US. Those are the frequencies: GSM: 850(B5)/900(B8)/1800(B3)/1900(B2) WCDMA: 850(B5)/900(B8)/1900(B2)/2100(B1) LTE FDD: 2100(B1)/1800(B3)/2600(B7)/800(B20) @目艮镜 "Is it support iphone 7plus?" Yes @Eve Eve "Do you get the wireless charger with the 4g model?" Unfortunately no. @uijong "Is the speaker open?" Please clarify your question. @Deborah Unfortunately we don't have funds to continue Eye's R&D without this Kickstarter campaign. @Ivan How would you mirror the camera app to take selfie with the main camera lens for portrait mode? Through the Lightning data connection between the Eye and the iPhone. Ting Yao huang I buy Super Early bird 4G, is that support my IPhone 6S plus? Yes, it supports also iPhone 6s Plus. @moshe levin Thank you Toda raba @mason Yes, you need to pledge $20 more for the wireless charger Bryan Tag Yes :) @Carl At the end of August. @Chapman Yes, you can add $34 and get the Eye 4G. @Jules DjHaitianboss I meant to say can I transfer over my music file from my iPhone to your product? Yes, you'll be able to do it. @Lauren Ashley Coleman Can I use my iPhone number with the eye 4G? Yes @Thep S'Prayoon @Benjamin Raffle Thank you :) @bjorn Venema Which connector do I need to charge the whole phone combination? Apple lightning or micro usb? Apple Lightning And when I charge wireless, will it also charge my iPhone? Yes. @Jules DjHaitianboss "And can I store my music as well on iPhone?" Can you please clarify your question? Jules DjHaitianboss With Eye 4G you can have both iPhone and Eye numbers connected at the same time. @Djayawarman Alamprabu We have some of what you mentioned on the Prototype Gallery. <url>#prototype-slide-42623 We'll definitely add some more videos. Additionally we'll go live soon and demo the working prototype and all we have done up to now. @tleong Yes, it has Google Play sevices. Eye 4G has SIM card slots, while Eye without 4G don't. Tyler Fletcher You can connect to the internet via the iPhone connection. @Xavier @Franco Thank you very much! Gerardo Aguilera Calls sounds will work through the iPhone hardware. Joshua Drewes Thank you very much! 1. You will receive one Eye for $69. 2. For Eye with SIM slots, you need to pledge $129. @Rosario It's limited for one person. Your wife can open her own Kickstarter account and pledge it. @Sanjay Yes it has! :) @Cyril Eye without 4G means no cellular connectivity at all
