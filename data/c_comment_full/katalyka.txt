Let me know what I'm allowed to make money doing, without the mark of melanin upon my skin, or in my forehead as melatonin that controls gender. Idiots. Soonsin, what am I allowed to lie about? Eat a dirt sandwich, Joebob. I made it clear that the budget was spent already, and I even put in hundred of dollars of my own money to get copies to some of my backers. Had Candy Realms been successful, then I would have felt motivated to use the profit to fulfill this stupid Kickstarter. But that didn't happen, so neither is my ability to give a crap. If you want the game, I have copies for sale on my Facebook page.
