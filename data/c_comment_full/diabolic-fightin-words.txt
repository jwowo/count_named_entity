This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. @Scott Desmarais: Diabolickickstarter@gmail I emailed everyone based on package Email me with the package you backed in the subject so I know what folder it belongs in This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. @shannon hall: go check your email, that should put it in perspective for you @shannon hall: and like I said, email me.. "It's on your personal page" no actually it's not. @shannon hall: you're bugged out homie.. I'm reading the facebook messages to you as we speak, no address or sizes.. Emails are also no address no sizes.. Go look for yourself, your facebook is dead, go check and show me where your shipping info is @shannon hall:humility? Absolutely not homie.. You're the one who's popping without any provocation. This isn't handled thru facebook that's why there's an email. If you emailed your info it would be in the section allocated for $200 packages.. Money has been spent on the merch you're supposed to receive, packaging and the remainder is for shipping so there is no refund because it's already been spent on YOUR package, if you'd pr vide shipping info you'd receive it This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. @shannon hall:I have every message from you, not once did you mention size or address information..

How would you know if you received the package of you don't live at the address you provided?? You'd just rather troll the internet anonymously popping off like a sucker. @Bolic is lazy: see you around homie @Joe:wrong guy @Michael Huntly: Hey guys.. Sorry I didn't update you on the status of your stuff.. This week I'm finishing up inventory on everyone who didn't receive their packages. I have them all packed up ready to go, organizing the shipping info has been a MAJOR setback.. I appreciate your patience and I apologize for not updating you sooner. @Corey B:are you doing inventory for me? How do you what was shipped and what wasn't? There's 300 packages in total going out. I don't see 300 people on here. Don't make assumptions dumb ass This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. This comment has been removed by Kickstarter.

CDs/shirts are shipping soon @ANTHONY GRAMAJO: No. I don't have it yet, vinyls Hitting in a couple weeks Thanks for the support everyone..
