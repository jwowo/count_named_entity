Well, there is anger and disappointment here, and rightly so. I am very late in getting the bardic Cd recorded, but it is at the production house now. If you watched my video or read my album notes, then you know that the CD was dedicated to my Mother who died shortly before I started recording. What no one in my family knew at the time was how much energy, both physical and emotion, would be needed to take care of my Dad. I frankly felt overwhelmed most of the time. His living arrangements changed in February and I finally felt like I was able to come up for air. The Second CD, Tome of Mystery is now at he factory in production. I should have it in my hands in early June. I will start sending it out ASAP. I resent digital download codes to those folks due them. I have found a way to get Poetry of Wonder up on the web so that I can get codes for that as well , and I will be sending out codes for it, and Tome of Mystery when it comes to bare. For those of you have still not received a physical package and are due one. I have mailed and mailed and mailed. I even re-mailed to two folks for whom I had delivery confirmation. I think you will really enjoy the new CD. It has almost 75 minutes of song and story and I have really put myself into it for you. If you still that you need a better resolution, then email me and I will do what I can to set things right. If you still feel that you cannot find resolution here, then I will refund any unrewarded pledges via paypal. Thank you for your initial hope and support, and I hope that I can re-earn your trust. Walk in peace. I have just added a 35 dollar level for a digital download of all three CDS Woot Thanks! Thanks!!!!
