It's been coming along slower then I anticipated on my end, but hopefully will speed up soon. The style I'm working with is very painterly, and tends to take a lot of time, mainly on the backgrounds. Sorry for the long silence, it's been hectic. Hey Kristofer, you might! Nikola Jajic will be at the Arcana Comics/studio booth doing some signings for his new book, Devil's Island. He'll also be on a panel. He's the man to harass.
