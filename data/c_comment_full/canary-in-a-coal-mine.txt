Hi Alana – if by activity you mean the updates, all backers should have received these updates in their inboxes. We'll definitely send out an update to all backers re: the switch to Mailchimp, but if you gave to the campaign, you do not need to sign up in order to continue receiving updates. Everyone was automatically added to the new system. The most important thing is to make sure of is that <email> and <email> are added to your address book to make sure these aren't going into your trash. You can also search your inbox for our latest updates to make sure they aren't going into "trash" or (if you use gmail) "updates": Help us build Canary's impact campaign: <url>"updates" tab as we were sending frequent updates. This fall we switched to sending updates to our supporters via our email list. Emails will come from <email> or you can try signing up again at our website, canaryinacoalminefilm.com Hi Tamara. Drop me an email at <email> and we can try to see what is happening. We have sent 42 updates since the launch of the campaign. They may be getting stuck in your spam box. You can also follow the film at FB.com/canaryfilm or at our website <url>– immensely touched by your enthusiasm and generosity!! To everyone--thank you so much for all of your comments and your support of this project. I am so sorry we don't have the capacity to respond to everyone who writes, but know that we try to read everything are grateful for the words of encouragement, reminders to pace, and also for the helpful critical feedback. To Chad--we are uploading a PG version of our six-minute preview which I hope you can share with your community. I will post the link here when it is live.
