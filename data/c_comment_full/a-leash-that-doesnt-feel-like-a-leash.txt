Thanks Kim and Tashi! We are bouncing with excitement here too. These suggestions are great, we are going to be adding toys to the line regularly. Leashes are on their way, we are looking forward to getting them to our Backers. Thank you SO much for your support! Thanks Lauren for the kind words and for the support! Two goldens, how great! We are on schedule to deliver in October! Hi Christina, We have six plush options for the Kickstarter, a giraffe, aardvark, chicken and three colors of our Binkies. Our Binkies can be carried in several ways, knotted, rolled up or flat. Dogs love them! If you scroll down on our project, you can see a photo of all six. We will send a survey at the end of the Kickstarter asking for your pick(s) for your pledge. Funny enough a fox is on our short list for our next round, we already have him sketched! Thanks for the question! Hi Sheila! At the end of the Kickstarter campaign you will receive a backer survey, where we will ask which toy (s) you would like, your address etc. Look for that the first week in October. Thank you so much for you support! Thanks Adair! Banks will love his new leash!
