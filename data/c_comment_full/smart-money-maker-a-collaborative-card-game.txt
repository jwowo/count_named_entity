Wonderful! Thank you for your message @Troy! Please send me your comments after you will have played, I am curious! Hi @David, thank you for your message! The game cards and packaging are printed. The supplier is putting together the whole. It's almost ready. Cheers, Laurence Thank you @Gerard for your complicity! Thank you @Tasha! I really appreciate! You back my first and second Kickstarter project! It means a lot to me! I've an appointment this afternoon with my suppliers to start to print! Talk to you soon! Cheers Laurence Thank you @Gordon! @Troy Thanks to your contribution the campaign reached the funding goal. I'm happy we had the chance to connect via Kickstarter. I'm looking forward to sending you your reward too. @Gerard Thank you again for being part of this journey! Please keep sharing it with gamers and anybody who like learning by playing ;-) Thank you, Dave! You can upgrade your pledge. It'd be $80 for 5 decks, or $95 for 6 decks (shipping to Netherlands included) :) Thank you for your support! Laurence Hi Thomas, Sorry, I didn't see your second message. Higher level pledges won't get the print-and-play files. Best, Laurence Hi Thomas, Welcome on board! I'm shipping from Milan. Best, Laurence
