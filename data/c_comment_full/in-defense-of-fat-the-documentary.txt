Thanks, Tom! Those guys are definitely on our radar, once the kickstarter ends, we'll be looking into more interview subjects going forward. Ona, thank you! Woohoo! Thank you so much, Ona! We really appreciate your support. Hi Susan If you look at the bottom of the email you received a few minutes ago, there's a "Unsubscribe from this project's updates with one click" option down at the bottom. Just click that, and you'll be unsubscribed from all of the updates we're sending to the old kickstarter project. That will keep you from receiving the "back the new project" updates, which we're only sending through the old campaign. Thanks so much for your support! Kennon Hi Michael Thank you for your suggestions. We've reached out to several people from the WAPF, and are hoping to get a chance to include their perspective in the film. Thanks, Scott! Hi Yeh, That's an excellent point. We've added a $100 reward where you can choose any one of the signed books plus get your choice of special-edition DVD or Blu-Ray Thanks for the suggestion! We will see if that's feasible to add. Hi Nancy! We may be shooting in the Northwest, if you want, go ahead and send your resume to <email> and we'll take a look once we get closer to production. Thanks for your support!
