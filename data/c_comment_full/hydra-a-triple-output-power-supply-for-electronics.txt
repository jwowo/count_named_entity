@Stevie The iOS zip file actually contains the Hydra's firmware source as well (for Atmel Studio). James, you will be happy to know that your Hydra is shipping tomorrow. :-D Thanks, Chris! The feedback is very much appreciated. Hi Larry, They haven't all shipped. We had some problems with enclosures and are waiting for the last batch of new enclosures to come from the anodizer. It'll definitely happen next week. Our first priority is to get the rest of the preorders shipped, which means working out the kinks in the bluetooth expansion boards and finalizing the iPhone and Android software. We'll look into the OS X version of the control software after that. In the mean-time, you can access the basic functionality of the Hydra from a serial terminal. Glenn - I'm not familiar with KCL experiments, but note that you cannot connect the Hydra outputs in series - their grounds are tied together. Hi Nick, There will be once all the bluetooth stuff is ready (we aren't quite there yet). The bluetooth expansion board will be available for purchase from www.chrobotics.com Ah, sorry. I still need to get the rest of the documentation finished. The baud rate is 14400. Brett, we don't have any adapters for the AC-DC converters that come with the Hydra, nor do we have an alternative version that is compatible with different types of outlets and voltages. Backers with different types of outlets will need to use a converter. Fabian, send me a message to change your shipping address if you haven't already. Yes, definitely. I'm not completely sure on the timeline since right now we are focused on getting everything else out the door, but once we are caught up we'll be looking more seriously into it. Thanks for pointing that out, Keith. I'll change the wording so that it is more clear. I'll also change the expected ship date to be more realistic. Hi Hashish, The price on our website was a pre-order price like what was on Kickstarter. In case you might feel slighted, note that the price on our website did not include shipping, so the Kickstarter preorder and the preorder from our website would have worked out to be the same. The Bluetooth board does NOT include bluetooth communication at the $179.00 price point. Hi Keith, Yes, very much so. We are getting very close to shipping the first pre-orders. Stay tuned! HI Glenn, Yes, the assembled PCBs are starting to trickle in. We received the first 16 yesterday and are in the process of testing them. They should all arrive before the end of next week if all goes well. And they should arrive this week, if they are true to their word. :-) We are still waiting to receive the completed PCBs from the fabrication house. The Hydra won't be able to top off a 12V lead-acid battery, though it will be able to charge it most of the way. Not since last week, but stay tuned - there are more updates on the way. Hey Paul, Unfortunately, we've been held back by some long-lead parts. We are crossing our fingers that they will get here next week. After that, we'll start cranking them out. Regardless, we should be able to start shipping well before the end of the month. Haha, thanks Charlie. I did learn recently that designers basically hate Comic Sans. What font would you recommend? Maybe in the future. We've actually already ordered the power supplies we'll be sending with the rewards, so its a little late to make the switch now. Ah, I see. Yes, the iPhone/Android device could definitely log the data. We weren't planning on adding that functionality, but it probably wouldn't be at all hard to do. Hey James, sorry about that. I missed the question. The Hydra doesn't have enough memory resources to log any appreciable amount of data. Any kind of serial datalogger could record data reported by the Hydra, though. I think Sparkfun has some decent data loggers for cheap. Hi Ken, The power supply outputs are not isolated, so the outputs can not be connected either in series or in parallel. Thanks, James. The Hydra can't discharge batteries, but it does apply the correct charging cycles for lithium cells (CC followed by CV while tracking power delivered). Yes, it will. When you change the voltage (or current limit), the background color of the display box will change while it updates the supply. After it is updated, the actual supply voltage and current will be displayed. This isn't happening in the video, but the software does it properly now. @Tim, Yes, the expansion port consists of four pins, Vin, GND, and USART tx and rx. Any expansion board must actually communicate serially. The protocol will be documented. The USB connection is not FTDI, but it does show up as a serial port on your computer. @Timothy Giles, The connectors are screw terminals, with the exception of the USB and expansion ports. If enough EU customers sign up, we might include a plug adapter, but the same wall adapter will be provided. @Colin, Yes, the Bluetooth expansion and other accessories will be available for purchase later as well. Yes, it does. It should even handle the transient spikes from the alternator. That's a great idea Keith! It's probably a little late to make that happen on the Hydra, but maybe that's something that could be done in the future. If not by CH Robotics, then maybe someone else. I'd love to see it. Maybe when we hit $30k (which should happen soon at this rate), we can make it a priority to make a cheap external knob interface for the expansion port. If it doesn't need an enclosure, we could knock it out quickly and for cheap, and send it out with all the Kickstarter Hydras we ship in April. I'll look into it... Yeah, we could release a schematic of a knob-based expansion fairly quickly. The design would be simple: 1) Three digital POTs forming three resistive voltage dividers. 2) An MCU (even an Arduino) to read the voltages 3) A UART connection from the MCU to the Hydra to control and read the output voltages and, optionally 4) Some kind of display to show the output voltages. Could be a 7-segment or a small LCD display. I'm guessing that someone with an Ardiuno background could throw something functional together in a day. Literally. @Nathan, The Hydra can't do negative voltages right now, but future versions might. We'd need to remove one of the positive supplies and design an adjustable negative output for it. You aren't the first person to ask this, so we are looking seriously at making a version with a negative output. Hi Brad, Yes, the aluminum case is grounded to provide shielding. Also, we could definitely throw together a quick knob-based expansion board that would work, but I'm not sure that we could have it ready by April, and if we could, it may not be as sleek and professional as the Hydra itself. BUT, we definitely plan to release that kind of expansion eventually, probably a few months after its official release in April. Thomas, that's a possibility we've considered. We shied away from offering an enclosure-less option because we really wanted to go for a nice, professional feel. But we may make an OEM version available when we start selling them through our website. The aluminum enclosure actually adds quite a bit of weight, and for some people, that really matters. Here's a thought, though - if flelxibility is desired, there are other things we can do that might make the supply more convenient. Right now, a downside to the Hydra is that you have to be connected to a computer or phone to visualize the output voltages and currents. This was a tradeoff we made to keep the costs and size down. But since the Hydra can communicate with any serial device over its expansion port, it would be possible (and even fairly easy) to design an expansion board with control knobs and even a small display to show the output and input voltage/current levels. Would this interest you? Kenneth and Brad - Adding an option to allow the supplies to be serially connected would be great, I agree. Unfortunately, this would require a fairly significant change to the switching topology, necessitating a substantial redesign (unless there is some way to do it that I'm not aware of!) Perhaps a future design will accommodate that requirement. Josh, Your point about security is a very good one! We hadn't considered that, but now that we're aware of the problem, we can add a feature for requiring a customizable password to connect to the device. Great feedback1 Hey Josh, Good questions. See below: 1) The efficiency is in the mid 90% range for output currents around 1 amp. Naturally, as the output current decreases, so does the efficiency. There is a special low-current, high efficiency mode that improves the low current efficiency, but the max output drops by quite a bit. 2) The limitation here is going to be the serial connection. Even via USB, the connection to the Hydra is converted to 38400 baud TTL UART. Given the required packet size of about 8 bytes, it will take 2 milliseconds to send each switching message to the Hydra. This means that the absolute maximum rate you could achieve would be 500 Hz. And this doesn't include turn-on and turn-off time. 3) There are a couple fault conditions. If the supply overheats, it will drop its output voltage. An overcurrent condition will also cause the voltage to drop. In either case, the controller will detect the change and (if connected to a compute) send a message indicating a voltage fault. We could have the supply be disabled if a fault is detected as well - that would be a software addition. 4) That's right - as long as the voltage fed back into the device is less than 14V, it should be fine. 5) Hmm, that's a good point. With a 12V max output limit, charging 12V batteries would take quite some time. I'll have a look at this. 6) Input, output, and other status monitoring happens via the computer interface. To be informed of the power status, it must be connected to a computer or some other device capable of reading the serial packets. 7) We don't have any specs on the humidity operating range yet (though there shouldn't be any major limitations). The temperature operating range goes from m-40 to +85 C. Hi Thomas, The board is actually not frail - the tinned lines just lack the soldermask (this is to allow an electrical connection to the enclosure and for better heat transfer). At 2.5A, you can expect to see transient switching spikes on the order of 100mV. Their duration is very short, but they are there. We'll be recording some actual data soon to include in the datasheet (also in the works).
