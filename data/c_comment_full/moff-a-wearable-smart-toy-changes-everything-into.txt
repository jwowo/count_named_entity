@J Dubrow We're considering about some services for developers such as SDK. But unfortunately the plan is undecided. As for now, we have been collecting the idea to consider from developers. @Keith Laflam Yes. We're preparing to launch our Android app in near future. Please look forward to using it. @Georgia Dabinett sorry for inconvenience. We'll send you the number via Kickstarter message. Please check it. @James Pollaro Sorry for inconvenience this time. We've just sent you a message on Kickstarter. Please check it. @ALOK CHAUBEY Sorry for inconvenience. We've sent you a message on Kickstarter. Please check it. @Steven Zachary Sorry for the inconvenience... We really want to make our Moff Band much better. In order to solve the problem, we would like to know the details. We will send you message later. Please keep in touch with us! @Brandon Griffin Thank you for your sharing the wonderful movie! It is very cute!! It is so much pleasure for us! Concerning the Android version, we are still working on it. Thank you for your patience. We will keep on upgrading our apps and plays! @Ravipart Lee @Neil Thank you for your comments. I think the function to hide the particular sounds will be important. We start to be considering it. Thank you for your feedback. It's greatly appreciated. @Yusuke Usui thank you!!! @Takagi Kensuke thank you for your comment and post! @Katarina Crea thank you for your comment and post! Your video is so great! Thank you! Did you record with Google Glass? By the way, concerning the toy gun, let me explain. For all plays, we use the technology of "patter recognition". We registered the particular movement / position patterns when developed. Moff Band and the app will recognize your movements and positions, and will calculate whether they match the registered patterns. Concerning the toy guns, I think, the range of our registered patterns is too small... We will deal with it. Thank you for your comment! It is greatly helpful. @Abdul Halim Mat Ali thank you for your comment! And sorry for the inconvenience.Concerning our Android version, please kindly wait. We will do our best! @arckal thank you for your comment! Have you already got our Moff Band? We hope you will enjoy with Moff Band. By the way, thank you for your questions! 1) does app allows you to customize sound? i.e. can we add out our own voice on some action? As of now, unfortunately, not yet. However, in future, we want to do that. We think it will be helpful for kids' creativity. 2) how loud is action sound? It depends on the situation. For the ordinary living room, it will be appropriate sound. 3) can more then one band connected to single iOS device/app? As of now, maximum is 2 Moff Bands can connect to single iOS device. 2 people can enjoy with each band or 1 person can enjoy with 2 Moff Bands, such as drum play. Please see the below play! <url>ï¼‰.iPhone4 is not equipped with BLE. And the version is only over i0S7.1. Can you get these iOS devies? Best reagards, Moff team @Mikael Nordgren @Abdul Halim Mat Ali Thank you for your comment! Your feedback will be very helpful for us. We are always thinking of Android and its importance.As of now, it's difficult to say the firm date. However, we recognize android support's importance. we wish we could do everything at the same time. We will do and introduce step by step. Sorry for your patience. Your kind understanding and feedback is highly appreciated. We will keep on updating info. Best regards, Moff team @Abdul Halim Mat Aki Thank you for your comment! Now, we are making molds. When molds made, we can show you more pictures! @Lilli and @Maxi Thank you for your comment! And sorry for our late update. Now, we are doing our final check for the preparation of mold and the other mass production. In a few days, we will get the sample for this. When we get this sample, we will updates. Best regards, Moff team @Nell Thank you for your funding and comment. Yes. I also have my kid.I believe the safety is the most important issue. We put high priorities on safety. We plan to do some safety tests. We will take care of safety more. Thank you. @Danny Thank you for your message!!!

Our slap band is ok for both adults and children. They can enjoy the same Moff band. Concerning the choice of colors, we discussed it with our partner factory many times. However, unfortunately, we need more quantity, Therefore, as of now, only the orange will be available... @Otoshi No Kami Thank you for your comment and support!!! @kokobin Thank you for your comment! We would like to create our Moff with users. Your ideas are highly appreciated. Thank you! @kokobin Thank you for your comment and idea!!! Boxing/fighting sounds nice!!! Users' ideas are very helpful for our development. Concerning customizations of gestures and sounds, we plan to offer the means inside our app without programming. @Rae Thank you for your comment! Various plays and sounds will be included for free in our app, when Moff band is delivered! @Patrick Thanks for your comment! Some answers in FAQ were updated belatedly so some people couldn't check it. We're sorry about it. We really appreciate your comment! @Patti @Joe Thank you for your asking! The upcoming android Moff app can work with the current Moff band. So you don't need to purchase different type of Moff band. Thanks! @Nick Thank you for your asking! It's under consideration if we stretch our goal or not! @Jonathan Thank you for your feedback! We would like to use your opinion as reference to improve Moff band and Moff app. It's highly apppreciated! @Sylvain Thank you for your asking. Moff band and Moff app connect in one-to-one relationship at the moment. However, we're developing app which can connect in one-to-many connection. @Abdul, thank you for your asking the questions. We appreciate that. Why do sounds appear from smartphones or tablets? First of all, we put high priorities on extendability of our service (Sounds are just our 1st step) by apps.That's why we fully utilize the capabilities of smartphones or tablets including their speakers. We have done the user tests many times and there's no problem. Please imagine the live music.Musicians play guitars and sounds appear from independent speakers different from guitar itself.It's the same.When you enjoy Moff, you will find this point doesn't matter. And the timing of support for android is under consideration.Please kindly look forward to it. @Ron, thank you for your question! Moff band uses the smartphone or tablets's speaker. We did the user tests many many times. And it was concluded its volume and quality of sound were sufficient indoors. @Osman, thank you for your message! It is a great honor for us! And thank you for your advice. We would like to add high value pledges...now, we are asking Kickstarter. @Dixon, thank you for your comment! We are excited too!!! Please look forward to arriving Moff! @Osman, thank you for your idea! It's highly appreciated!
