Oh hey, I somehow just found your comment Álex Hernández-Puertas - sorry :\ Unfortunately we won't be giving out free WiiU keys ;-) (FYI: Given limited supply it's not even an option) Hey Ben, Your key should be available in your Flippfly Account. If you need to login and don't know / remember your password, you can go here: <url>"Forgot Password". Then enter the email you use for Kickstarter and hit "Send Password Info". That should send you an email with a link to login. If you can't login or have any other trouble feel free to create a ticket here: <url>"Forgot Password" and enter the same email that you use for your Kickstrarter account. That should resend the registration e-mail and let you setup the account. If you (or anybody really) has any trouble please feel free to contact us. We will do whatever it takes to get things working for you. Wow finallyanime - sounds like you had a busy night - thank you!!! And thanks to the guys over at Pixelscopic for the comment last night - and thanks to all of you amazing backers!!! Oh yeah, I almost forgot we've got a Greenlight page: <url>
