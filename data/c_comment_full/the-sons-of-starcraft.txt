Just a reminder: I recently tweeted that filming has wrapped on the project and that Post Production has been underway for quite some time now. Our post production staff have been combing through the multiple terabytes of footage that has been collected over the past several years of filming this project. All kickbacks will be mailed out at the time of the films release. If you have any questions, concerns, or updates on your information please message me through Kickstarter or send an email to <email>. I will get in touch with you as soon as possible. Thanks Again Everyone!!~
