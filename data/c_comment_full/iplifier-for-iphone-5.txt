Sorry for lack of updates. Production is done and delivery will start in the next few days. Hello everybody, A last minute delay caused by a need to modify the injection mold will change delivery date to the end of this week. I apologize. (And I also do not have have all survey responses) Check out pictures from the tooling <url>"patent pending". The design, on the other hand, can be easily patented but the iPlifier is very different from the SoundClip. Regards, Ariel
