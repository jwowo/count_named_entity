A few members of our team worked at BDG last year beforeother found out the owner was being shady with funds. They left and joined our team shortly after. As for the concept art, it seems we have been subjected to false claims of ownership right to our concepts. The game itself is well in progress and is NOT a scam of any kind. Thank you for understanding. If you have any furthure questions please feel free to ask. Hey Everyone, Look for an update this coming monday! Hey Ben, I will look into this and get back to you as soon as we can come up with something that makes sense! Thanks for all your support! Hey David, you will be able to make copies and pass them around to friends and family (no limit). We believe that open shared media does more good than harm (we are napster fans from back in the day). I hope this helps :-) Hey Ben, MYTHIC will roll out as single player first. We are aiming to have multiplayer roll out summer 2013.
