Dear Rabe, Thank you for the kind words. I hope that you will love your blanket! Dear Tony, Unfortunately all of the orders outside of Europe are being held up by the slow customs process of the United States while being imported to my American distribution center. I have been calling many times a day and will post an update when I am more sure of the time frame I can get these delivered by. These issues came as a big surprise to me and I am very sorry for the delay. Thanks for your patience. Bianca Dear Rabe, European orders are being shipped from Germany on Monday morning. Again, I apologise for the delay. The export process has been incredibly difficult to expedite. Bianca Dear Jennifer, Here are the instructions that I found on kickstarter.com. Hope this helps! "How can I view or change my survey responses? If you’ve already submitted your backer survey, you can review your response by visiting the project page and clicking the 'Your response' text in the bottom of the reward tier you selected. If the creator of this project has enabled address changes [I have], you’ll notice an option at the top of this modal that will allow you to change your shipping information." Best wishes, Bianca Hi Rabe, I have had a few last minute delays exporting the blankets to my American and European distributors. In less than two weeks you should be warm under your bloom blanket. I apologise for the wait! Bianca Tony, thank you for answering Jennifer's questions. I plan to start shipping the first blankets mid-October. Jennifer, I'm so sorry for all of the confusion. You have not received an address survey because you did not select any reward. I have sent you a private message hoping that we can sort this out. Hi Henry, Thanks for your comment. I've been flying between Barcelona and Rome to organise the purchase of 2 kilometers of wool for my backers! I'll post an update with pictures soon. Cheers, Bianca
