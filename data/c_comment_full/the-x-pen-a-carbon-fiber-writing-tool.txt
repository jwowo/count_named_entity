Jordan: Sorry to hear you lost your pen! I would be happy to get you another one. I'm not actively selling them (working on a ton of other projects), but still have plenty of materials and could get one to you. Please shoot me an email at <email> and we can work out the details! -Kyle Big John: Thanks for the feedback! It's been a while since I made them, and it's nice to see it is still holding up.

We were balancing a fine line between "too tight" and "not tight enough" with the cap, and found that even a .0002" difference in the diameter of the tip or plug can mess with how the cap fits. A pair of needle-nosed should be able to pull the end cap out and press it back into the pen body. -Kyle All: Jet Pens is the place to do it--that's where I'm getting the refills in the first place. (www.jetpens.com) -Kyle I'm going to be placing a large blanket order for the refills--they are pretty hard to come by! As of now, they will all be the same (probably 0.4 mm in blue), but if you have a special request, I would be happy to try and fill it. A lot of it depends on the availability at the time of order.
