Hi Michele, Here is the ProjectorARM video: <url>—WOW Thank You So Much! With the goal reached and 35 days left, I'm starting to think about stretch goals, but those would still be a little ways off. Ideas are welcome, but my main focus right now is running a good campaign and delivering some awesome rewards! Hey JD, All you need to do is read through the campaign page. The “My Store” and “Production Plan” sections make it very clear—I'm trying to be as open and honest as possible. The ProjectorARM, as I detail under the production plan, will be pieced together from existing phone holders. What I have now is just a prototype, and what will be delivered will be a custom arm because none of the existing ones work to my satisfaction. Just read that section. And the arm is only half of the ProjectorArm, the other half is custom Fresnel lenses, which are actually much more valuable then the arm. As for knocking off the neolucida, if you would have read the “My Story” section, you'd see I've been developing this design since 2005, and my camera lucidas are very very different from the neolucida—completely different optical system. I address that in one of the FAQ at the bottom of the page. But I see you just created a new account to hide your real name and only back for $1 to make a negative comment.
