Guys, Happy New Year and we at Vertus Audio wish you a very happy and successful year. We had planned to have the machine-assembled prototype ready for the update and since we don’t have it yet, we are going to post an update through this comment. We chose our American manufacturer that is going to make the machine-assembled prototype and then later produce the final electronic boards for us, all here in the USA. This is a big step forward for us in making Vertus a true and very rare "Made in USA" consumer electronics device. Due to the the manufacturer’s recommendations, we need to make some changes to the design of the board and submit it to them to make the prototype and move towards the production. Thanks everyone for the patience and we will keep you guys updated! Guys, We are going to post the update with all the details about the selected manufacturer and more on Jan 4. We hope all of our hard work will soon be appreciated! Guys, We are working hard on the project and will post an update soon. There is a high possibility that our boards can be completely manufactured and assembled here in the U.S., which would make Vertus completely a Made in USA product which is very rare in consumer electronics. We are talking with two companies now that are promising prices close to China and Hong Kong for mass production of the boards and we will give the prototype board machine-assembly to the one that we finalize the deal with. Despite the delays, Vertus is still unique in its original vision and is the most advanced Bluetooth audio adapter in the world. Guys, we have a major good announcement however we need to finalize couple more things before writing an update so we will be posting the update on Sunday the 5th. We apologize for this delay. VertusAudio Team Guys, we are going to post the new update with all the details on September 29. VertusAudio Team (Kev) Kevin Grezcyn: We said we are going to contact the manufacturer and try to push them and that's exactly what we did. Listen, You have crossed all the lines in terms of disrespecting our project, us, Kickstarter community and most importantly our backers. We have put our lives into pushing this project towards completion despite the numerous struggles that we have faced with, and you are simply not allowed by any means (ethically and legally) to play with our and our projects’s reputation on your free will, just based on your $59 early bird pledge. You even tried to make a complain on us in La County Consumer Affairs and after they called us and we explained the situation, they completely supported our project and said that they will contact you and explain it to you and I'm sure they did. By counting days and disrespecting and spamming our profile, you are not helping and instead you are trying to take our time and energy away from the project which is extremely disrespectful to our backers. But, listen, currently we are trying to not waste our energy and time on you and instead we are completely focused on completing the project (which is still unique and original without any competitors) as soon as possible and indeed once we finish fulfilling all the orders, we will now almost certainly pursue the strong Defamation and Defamation Per Se cases against you. @Michael Morrissey: We are still waiting for the new machine-assembled prototype board to arrive and as soon as we get them, we will post the update. We will contact the manufacturer tomorrow again and will try to push them to send the boards as soon as possible! Kev (Kevin Grezcyn): That's true that all of our backers want us to succeed but you, wanting us to succeed, is seriously questionable. Every bit of your actions, false accusations and false criminal accusations shows otherwise. As we've said before, Kickstarter's policy states that creators are obligated to offer refunds and share a use of funds statement if and only if they completely fail to fulfill the project, which is not the case here and instead the funds are well budgeted and we are on track toward fulfilling the project. All your other questions have been answered throughout updates and comments. @Scott: As you know, we have designed the board here in USA, and we are just sending the prototype board to overseas for machine assembly of its electronic components to save costs and manage our budget. @Frank: All parts and manufacturing has been paid/budgeted in advance and that's why we say we want to manage our budget as much as we can so we don't get into that reserved budget. @kev (Kevin Grezcyn): Before bombarding the comment section with wrong accusations and jumping to conclusions, take a look at the writing one more time. We wrote "...because making motherboard prototypes in USA costs a lot and also takes time, even though much less than oversees..." the part saying "even though much less than oversees" is addressing the TIME and not the COST which is exactly what is happening right now. Look, by trying to find a hiccup in our work, it wouldn't get you anywhere because there is none. And all this false accusations and bombardment of our comments section, strengthens our drive to pursue a defamation case on you after we finish shipping all the orders. To remind you again the potential case is going to be based on the California Civil Code Cal. Civ. Code §§ 44, 45 and 45a. Also, please note that, the section 45a is the Defamation Per Se law (with a sister law in the state of New Jersey ,Charge 8.46) which is basically a law that gives the plaintiff the opportunity to win the defamation case without proving any reputation or financial loss when the defendant has falsely accused the plaintiff of a criminal activity in public. So, aside from your many defamatory comments against us, you have also accused us of being thieves numerous times in our comments section and since we are not thieves but instead are hard working individuals that are trying hard to bring the project into completion as soon as possible, you have clearly accused us of a criminal activity which we have not done. So, we would suggest you to stop all this accusations and disrespecting, because it just hurts you as much as it hurts us and its better to realize that now, than realize it when you get the Vertus in your mailbox shortly. @Evan Schwartz: We understand your concern, but since we have a very high standard in our company, which we have followed and we are going to continue following, we would send the Vertus as a reliable and advanced product along with its accessories all in one package. The charging station doesn't need any further development, and the extra battery pack is going to have the same Lithium-ion charging circuitery as its used in Vertus but on a very small baord. @Schwai: Adding the new advanced features hasn't slowed us down but instead we have used the opportunity, in terms of having to design a new board, to keep Vertus way ahead of any product in its class. Also, the board hasn't arrived yet because we have sent it oversees for machine assembly which takes a longer time and these companies usually don't pay much attention to single prototype orders and they always give priority to large orders of at least 1000 peices. The reason that we sent the board overseas for machine assembly is because it is very expensive inside USA to produce prototype assembled baords and since we have already lost a lot of money on this project, we want to manage our budget as much as we can. @Scott: We will post an update soon, once we get new information about the new board's arrival. @Evan Schwartz: Evan, the delay that we are experiencing now is due to our commitment of delivering a flawless and advanced product to our backers. Vertus is still very unique in its concept and no other product is comparable to Vertus in terms of its core functionality which is to add True Stereo Wireless to any speaker along with its very advanced features. We have worked hard to deliver a product that would define the highest standards of our company and our vision and when Vertus systems gets to our backers, our only goal would be to see our backers’ satisfaction and appreciation. Also, please note that the charging station is an extension of Vertus receivers and doesn’t have an electronic circuit, which means that the advanced charging capability is built into the Vertus and the charging station is a convenient charging base to charge one or two Vertuses at the same through the 3.5mm jack. Vertus’ advanced charging functionality gets activated once it’s plugged into the charging station and recognizes it with our proprietary mechanical detection. We are still waiting for the new prototype machine-assembled board to come from overseas and we try to stay close to the timeline that we gave in update #10 as much as we can. Guys, we have posted a new update. Please check it out in the updates section. Guys, testing and troubleshooting the new board is almost complete, which means we are almost ready to order the second prototype board. We are going to post a detailed update on June 19 which would include some technical explanation and summary of the testing and troubleshooting process, new pictures of the upgraded enclosure, a video showing the board mounted in the new enclosure, and a proposal for the design of the packaging. We have one goal, and it is to show our backers that we would never stop until we see them happy and satisfied with their experience with Kickstarter and Vertus Audio. @ Michael Hopkins: Michael, first we are going to explain the situation of the project and where we stand legally and then we are going to explain what legal options are possible or not possible regarding Kickstarter’s Accountability policy and most importantly what are the extent of legal options that are possible based on the DEFAMATION LAW. This is a copy of the Kickstarter's Accountability policy regarding legal actions against project creators: " Is a creator legally obligated to fulfill the promises of their project? Yes. Kickstarter's Terms of Use require creators to fulfill all rewards of their project or refund any backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill. (This is what creators see before they launch.) This information can serve as a basis for legal recourse if a creator doesn't fulfill their promises. We hope that backers will consider using this provision only in cases where they feel that a creator has not made a good faith effort to complete the project and fulfill. " So, basically this policy states that the creators are subject to legal actions ONLY if backers see a clear indication that the creators will fail to fulfill the rewards completely and not issue any refunds. A clear indication would include cutting communications with backers completely, not having any plan in fulfilling the rewards while the project is delayed, and not showing any progress. Furthermore, Kickstarter requires creators to explain the risks and challenges of fulfilling the rewards in the Risks and Challenges section of the campaign and provide an ESTIMATED delivery date. As a result we have a detailed risks and challenges section on our campaign. This is a copy of Kickstarter's Accountability policy regarding delays: “What should creators do if they're having problems completing their project? If problems come up, creators are expected to post a Project Update (which is emailed to all backers) explaining the situation. Sharing the story, speed bumps and all, is crucial. Most backers support projects because they want to see something happen and they'd like to be a part of it. Creators who are honest and transparent will usually find backers to be understanding. It's not uncommon for things to take longer than expected. Sometimes the execution of the project proves more difficult than the creator had anticipated. If a creator is making a good faith effort to complete their project and is transparent about it, backers should do their best to be patient and understanding while demanding continued accountability from the creator. If the problems are severe enough that the creator can't fulfill their project, creators need to find a resolution. Steps could include offering refunds, detailing exactly how funds were used, and other actions to satisfy backers.” So, basically this policy states it is common for projects to be delayed and creators should inform the backers of the difficulties and speed bumps that they face until they succeed in completing the project and it states again that creators are obligated to refunds, ONLY if they fail to deliver the rewards completely. Our project is delayed because of unfortunate reasons which we have covered in detail through updates and comments through-out the last ten months. In fact our latest update showed pictures of our newly assembled prototype boards of the new Vertus along with a technical report and an estimated timeline. As we see here, again we have not violated any of the Kickstarter's policies (which both creators and backers agree before backing a project or launching a project) by following our promise of delivering a flawless and reliable product as soon as we can along with clear descriptions of the situations. As a result, currently there is absolutely NO LEGAL ACTION POSSIBLE on us (the Vertus creators). The Washington lawsuit case against "Asylum", mentioned in the comments, is completely a different story because the creator has cut all the communications with the backers since July with no updates and timelines. As we see here, the creator of that project has clearly violated the kickstarter's Accountability policy and has become the subject of the aforementioned lawsuit. We have dedicated our lives to this project and by knowing that our generous backers helped us in bringing our vision to reality, we haven't and won't violate the Kickstarter's Accountability policy by any means and furthermore we would defend our reputation by the maximum extent of law against individuals that try to damage our image and reputation and mislead our Kickstarter backers and new potential customers with false accusations against us which include accusing us of stealing the campaign fund and being scammers. Because the false accusations and threats of lawsuits against us has really reached a critical stage throughout the last week by few select individuals, we have spent the last five days on discussing this matter with various law offices in Los Angeles and other cities in California, New Jersey, and Washington. As a result of the discussions, we have the privilege to pursue legal actions against the select individuals that are trying to damage our image and reputation based on the DEFAMATION LAW. This link clearly explains the law in California: <url>§§ 44, 45 and 45a: §§ 44. Defamation is effected by either of the following: (a) Libel. (b) Slander. §§ 45. Libel is a false and unprivileged publication by writing, printing, picture, effigy, or other fixed representation to the eye, which exposes any person to hatred, contempt, ridicule, or obloquy, or which causes him to be shunned or avoided, or which has a tendency to injure him in his occupation. §§ 45a. A libel which is defamatory of the plaintiff without the necessity of explanatory matter, such as an inducement, innuendo or other extrinsic fact, is said to be a libel on its face. Defamatory language not libelous on its face is not actionable unless the plaintiff alleges and proves that he has suffered special damage as a proximate result thereof. Special damage is defined in Section 48a of this code. Thanks to the Kickstarter's non-edit commenting system, all the false accusations against us by the select individuals have been recorded and can be used in the potential defamation lawsuits against them. The potential lawsuits are going to demand compensation regarding business reputation and financial damage. These individuals include but not limited to Kevin Grezcyn (Kev), Graeme Bell, Blake Long, and Michael Hopkins. @Scott Hoeflich: Sorry for answering your questions late, because as we said on top we have been really busy the last five days in finding a solution to protect our reputation and image and limit financial damages by discussing with various Defamation law offices across three states and we are happy that there is a clear path in fighting against false accusations legally. These select individuals don't understand that by making false accusations and invalid threats of a lawsuit, they are making us to focus on legal matters instead of working on the project. But, to give you a brief update regarding the progress, the testing and troubleshooting goes well and as planned. We have fixed almost all the major issues regarding the micro-controller. We will update our backers of the progress once we finish the testing and troubleshooting of the new board towards the end of May and order the second prototype board as soon as possible. Guys, we are working on the update and will post it tomorrow at 6pm PST. @Scott Hoeflich: As we said earlier, we’ve been waiting for three of the larger components to finish the assembly, and since then we've got two of the components and the only component we are waiting for now is the BT module itself that is going to arrive on Monday. We will post the update on April 8, which will give us enough time to finish the assembly and do a test run. @Evan Schwartz: The prototypes are coming along well so far. We have assembled most of the components and are waiting for three of the larger components to arrive, which are getting shipped to us direct form their manufacturers. Also, we appreciate that you pointed out the fact in the last update, that we are going to post an update once we test the prototypes. So basically, testing the board, troubleshooting, and modifying the micro-controller software would take couple of weeks, but, we will post the update just after a quick test once we get the remaining components and finish the assembling. Guys, we are excited to say we are going to get the PCBs (printed circuit boards) on Thursday and once we get them, we will post an update with pcitures. Then, after hand-assembling the components on the pcbs, we will post a full update showing the pcitures of the fully assembled boards and the updated timeline. @Scott Hoeflich: We answered your questions about the boards in this comment and we will answer the rest about the timeline in the updates. @Martin, Maxim Morozov, and Howeln: Thank you! @Matt: Thank you for the suggestion. @Dairui Ke and Jeffry Moore: We are doing everything on our part to deliver a perfect product as soon as possible and there are times that there is not much to share with backers except the very complicated technical stuff which wouldn't be appropriate and interesting information for most of our backers. @Andrew Casey: We are waiting for the new boards, and as soon as we get them, we will post the update with the new timeline. @Kevin Grezcyn (kev): We have always been in the comments board along with your continuos negative comments and spams and your questions have already been answered in the updates and comments section. Even in your last comment, you accused us of being scam by saying “Since you haven’t built anything you should have funds available for anyone’s refund request.” This is ridiculous. As I told you already, this doesn’t help with anything but hurt the progress by taking the time from us which was supposed to be spent on the project. Michael Morrissey: Thank you for the positive comment, it really helps! Blake Long, Kevin Grezcyn (kev): Guys, by spamming our profile, you are not helping, but actually hurting our progress. Yes a lot of things went wrong in the process of developing our product and yes it is 6 months past due the shipping date but we’re working 20 hours a day to overcome these problems and ship these products as soon as possible, which always have been our dream. Yes, the website was down for couple of hours due to a temporary problem with the account. You just want to find a lead that we are scams. WE’RE NOT! We’re not hiding and we’re not afraid of our information to be shared because we don’t have anything to hide! The LinkedIn account is NOT mine and you are violating that persons privacy and also violating Kickstarter and LinkedIn's policy by accusing him of wrong allegations. Yes, I did put my Instagram on private because you threatened to spam my account which you already started to. I’m not even gonna comment on the “fancy watches and vacations” because its just ridiculous. From starting you two, have been anything but chill. You guys keep writing negative comments which do not have a respond, thus no response from us. We have answered any question anyone had from the beginning! Kickstarter is a creative community to fund creative projects through true backers and is not a retail store. Kickstarter’s policy states that the estimated delivery dates are just estimates and the creator’s of the projects are obligated for refunds or subject to possible legal action, ONLY when the creators forfeit the project and fail to show any progress and fail to deliver the rewards completely. Therefore, NO LEGAL ACTIONS are possible for us, because we have always updated our backers and we are dedicated to deliver not only a product, but a flawless and advanced electronics device to our backers. We posted a progress update comment on Jan 27 and in the comment we stated that we are waiting for the boards which should arrive in about three weeks, and we would post an update with the pictures and information. Today, is only two weeks past from the date of comment which technically gives us another week or two to receive the boards and post the update. This a copy of our original comment on Jan 27: "JAN 27: We finally got the info we were waiting for on when the new boards would be shiped to us. We are going to get the boards in about three weeks. Once we get them, we will put an update showing you the new boards. Meanwhile, we just want to thank everyone for patiently waiting for our progress. It might not be as fast as we planned, but there is definitely a strong progress towards making the most advanced Bluetooth adapter in the world. VertusAudio team” At VertusAudio, we are dedicated to do our responsibility of delivering our promises as rewards as soon as we can. We also as a company are against spammers, the same way that Kickstarter is against spamming. Also, We would like to emphasize again that we have not violated any of Kickstarter’s rules and therefore we are not subject to any Legal Action, but, again we would like to emphasize that, after talking to our company lawyers in Glendale, CA, as a company, we would pursue with every possible legal action towards select individuals that cause harm to our company’s reputation and image by misleading other backers by spamming our profile with misleading information. Everyone, we do apologize for being past due 6 months, but again, its not only us in Kickstarter to face problems like this. Starting a company is very hard specially an electronics company with just two people. But that’s how every company starts and grows eventually. Vertus is a result of our backers’ belief and appreciation towards our company, and it would’t have come this far without our faithful backers which we truly appreciate and acknowledge everyday. VertusAudio team We finally got the info we were waiting for on when the new boards would be shiped to us. We are going to get the boards in about three weeks. Once we get them, we will put an update showing you the new boards. Meanwhile, we just want to thank everyone for patiently waiting for our progress. It might not be as fast as we planned, but there is definitely a strong progress towards making the most advanced Bluetooth adapter in the world. VertusAudio team @Michael Morrissey: We will have information for the boards on Monday. @Kevin: The January shipping is a misleading information that you are saying. We gave an estimated Timeline in Update #7 which shows what are the next steps after receiving the first prototypes. @Michael: As you know, our micro-controller (which is basically a very tiny computer) acts as the central control unit of the system and has the ability to change the different modes and functionalities of Vertus. We are working on the micro-controller software regarding the user interface (buttons and the status LED) and system control until we get the boards, so we can program the boards and test the system. @Adam: Yes, you'll be able to do that. @Evan Schwartz: Thank you and we all wish you the same! @Andrew Casey: We are going to post a short update soon before Christmas. @Dvir Shimon Sasson: Asking for more updates is a right of all our backers and we totally understand that, but accusing us as being scammers, is just not right! I don't know if you remember, but we had a test video from the first day of our campaign that showed both speakers working at the same time. The video is still on the profile and you can take a look at it if you'd like. Vertus is not a standalone product, it is an add-on to any speaker giving the speaker capabilities the speaker didn't have before. Therefore our product cannot be shown working standalone and it needs a speaker to show its capabilities. The reason why we used Jambox speakers was to show our backers that even speakers that have Bluetooth but do not have the True Wireless Stereo technology, would still need Vertus to work as a pair at the same time. @Graeme: We actually posted the updated 20 minutes before your comment, on November 15 in our time. Guys, as we said a week ago, we are going to post an update on Nov 15 ! @The JJ: We understand your concern, but it is essential to mention that a Kickstarter backer, not only believes in the project but more importantly trusts its creators and that's a case that is not followed here by a select few. We haven't posted an official update recently, but we have followed through comments regarding the progress and stated many times that as soon as we have answers to the aforementioned questions we will post an update and at this point we will have enough information to post the update on November 15. As a result, we appreciate every one of our backers and we haven't and would never attempt to be disrespectful to the individuals that helped us. @Matt: Thanks for your understanding and be confident that the wait will be rewarding. We definitely will have an official update in November to explain the progress in detail. @Madalena: Sorry about that, please send us your Amazon transaction ID so we can help you regarding the error. Thanks @Kevin: We wrote an update comment on Oct 7 and explained the situation and I'm copying it here for your reference: " Hey guys, everything is going well, we are continuously testing and modifying the in-development software. The reason why we don't put many updates is because we don't have any visuals or new things to let you guys know. We have one goal and that's to make the perfect product without any issues and in order to reach our goal, we need to keep evaluating and modifying the in-development software and continue the development of the new motherboard with high standards. Once we're done with this stage, we are going to move on to having the first complete prototypes with the new modules, which would let us to show you guys visuals and post updates more often." @Graeme, @David: Kickstarter is about funding a project and helping the creators in the project development process and getting rewards as a return of the investment in a vision and, as a result, its not a store and doesn't follow the conventional rules of a store such as refunds, which are destructive for the vision and for the project as a whole. Hey guys, everything is going well, we are continuously testing and modifying the in-development software. The reason why we don't put many updates is because we don't have any visuals or new things to let you guys know. We have one goal and that's to make the perfect product without any issues and in order to reach our goal, we need to keep evaluating and modifying the in-development software and continue the development of the new motherboard with high standards. Once we're done with this stage, we are going to move on to having the first complete prototypes with the new modules, which would let us to show you guys visuals and post updates more often. @Michael Morrissey: Yes, it's still the same as what we stated in update #6. Guys, everything is going fine and be assured that we are doing our job. We are working back and forth with the engineering teams in different aspects and we will post updates when we get to important points in the journey. As of now, we are testing and modifying the beta software on our new development boards and also designing the new main board and dealing with other technical aspects of the project. @Yagami: 1) By just flipping a switch on Vertus, you can convert it to a transmitter. 2) yes. 3) you can buy an additional Vertus from our website VertusAudio.com 4) We have couple of options for that stuff and will let our backers know once we choose the best solutions. Guys please bear with us until August 13th, we are gathering all the needed information to post a detailed update of our plan. Thank you for understanding! Vertus Audio @Yagami: We are still waiting for some key information from our Bluetooth supplier to post the update and as soon as we get the information, we will post the update. Also, regarding the survey, we got the gunmetal grey anodized parts but it is darker than we expected, so we had to return the parts to be anodized again with the correct shade and when we get them back we will send the surveys. @Blake: We will post the update tomorrow. @Darshan & @Matt: If you leave Vertus on and you go out of range, Vertus will enter the standby mode and when you come back in the range, you will just need to click on the device name in your Bluetooth menu to connect. But, if you turn Vertus off and when you come back you turn it on, Vertus will automatically connect to your phone. @Graeme: Actually there is alot to share with our backers, we are just waiting to get all the required information to post an update in couple of days. Also, regarding the frequency of updates, if you check our comment on June 12, we said that we will post an update when we have major announcements or when we set key milestones and this way our updates won't be repetitive. @Blake @Darshan: We will send the surveys in about two weeks, and regarding the shipping date, along our journey there are stuff that are beyond our control, but we are doing our best to meet our estimated timeline. Everything is going as planned, we are going to post an update on July 3. We want to let our backers know that everything is going well and as planned. We decided to write updates when we have a major announcements or when we set key milestones. This way, our updates won't be repetitive and instead we can let our backers know of regular follow-ups through comments. Our Bluetooth supplier is working on the final stages of the development and customization and we are still working on the announcement of the transmitter add-on. We are also developing the clip add-on with audio controls! Also, we will send the surveys once we gather all the needed questions. Overall everything is going as planned and we're working hard to get Vertus in your hands as soon as possible. @Jollin, @Dairui: We have been very busy this last 12 days with Amazon payments, failed transactions, transfer of funds , paperworks and other stuff that needed to be done before going forward. Therefore, we will start the production updates including news about the add-ons from next Wednesday. @Yagami: That's a good question and the answer is, connecting two add-ons simultaneously would be totally fine! @Yagami : The transmitter add-on is going to look similar to the battery pack add-on and regarding the case, we already have some options and also it was surprising that you brought the idea of adding some controls with an add-on, since we are already working on a prototype add-on that would add the button controls if its needed combined with the clip function which we will introduce on our website in coming weeks. @Blake and @Andy: We haven't send out the surveys yet but we're going to send them soon. @Josh @Suhail @Evan and @Jerry: Have you guys gotten any emails from amazon yet? @Peter: We are working on the transmitter. I can not say exactly when it will be available in the website but we're trying to make it available to order as soon as possible. @Manil: You can't increase your pledge on Kickstarter. However, Vertus is available for preorder at vertusaudio.com @Helge and Jerry: I just talked to one of the associates at Amazon and she said that the credit cards are getting initiated now and they are going to charge the cards starting sometime tomorrow. Please check again tomorrow, if you still do not see any charges, let us know we will check with Amazon again. @Evan, @The JJ: Thank you. @Darius: The battery packs have a discharge current rate of about 100mA and might work with other micro-USB devices. @Heri: If you do research about the big differences in sound quality between different Bluetooth products in market today, you would see that sound quality is related to more complex technical aspects such as the quality of the Digital to Analog converter (DAC), signal to noise ratio, and internal Digital Sound Processing. So, as I wrote earlier because our product excels in these technical properties, the sound quality might be even higher than some Apt-X products. Anyways, CSR's TrueWireless Stereo technology currently doesn't support Apt-X and if they support it, we will implement it and also to get Apt-X, both ends should support Apt-X and all iOS devices such as iPhones, and iPads currently don't support it. @Justin: Based on Kickstarter's rules, each person can only pledge on one reward in a project. @Kevin: Thanks! @Corey: The charging station is a smart docking station that is used to charge up to two Vertus receivers conveniently at the same time. @Heri: CSR's TrueWirless Stereo technology currently doesn't support the apt-x codec. But it doesn't make much difference since our Bluetooth module produces a very high quality sound by using a great built-in DAC and internal digital sound processing that surpasses must Bluetooth products in the market. Also, all iOS devices such as iPhones and iPads don't support apt-X. @Yeong: Not in our Kickstarter campaign, but expect some cool add-ons that we are going to introduce in our website. @The JJ: The transmitter add-on will have a slightly higher price than the battery pack add-on. Also, we are working on some interesting ideas regarding other add-ons and once we are ready to introduce any of them, we will let our backers know through updates. @Garth: Vertus supports SBC and MP3 codecs over A2DP. @Vladimir: Thanks, that should be fine. @Byron: Vertus is smart, it turns on automatically when you plug it in and turns off when you unplug it. Also while plugged-in, if it is not receiving music, it goes to standby mode. @James: I understand that a lot of backers wont need the micro-USB cable but again there are ones that do need them, so we need to supply them anyways. @Suhail: Thanks for being our Kickstarter exclusive Limited Edition backer. The Limited Edition reward is priced higher for its exclusivity and personalization and not for more features or more parts. So if you want the battery packs, please add the amount needed to your pledge. @Yagami: The CSR's TrueWireless Stereo technology is designed to spread the music in a collective stereo form, and we are unable to change its functionality. @Nick: Yes we will supply that. Abdussamat! Exactly, and that is why the Early Bird full packages are limited! This is Kickstarter, and that's why we tried our best to set the lowest price we could afford to break even and even lose money for the $59 Early Bird reward. Whenever you get a chance, just take a look at the premium-grade electronic components offered from reputable American suppliers, and you will see that even with a large order quantity, you can not do much. Regardless, thank you for being our backer. We have been working hard the last couple of days in preparing the UPDATE regarding the transmitter add-on which we are going to introduce shortly. @Saleh: That's a cool way to use Vertus! Yes, it should work. @Elena: Bluetooth transmitter (sender) is a device that lets you add Bluetooth to a music source for example an iPod or even a TV. But, Vertus (as receivers) would work great with HiddenRadio speakers. You can connect up to two HiddenRadios and play the same audio on both HiddenRadio speakers at the same, wirelessly, @Angelo: You have two ways to charge Vertus. First one is charging by the micro-USB port on each Vertus. Second one is by using the charging station which can charge up to two Vertus receivers at the same time through their 3.5mm jacks. We supply a USB power adapter with every charging station. The good thing about charging station is that you can charge two Vertus receivers at the same time which in overall makes charging Vertus easier. It acts much like a dock for an iPhone. @James: We're going to introduce the transmitter add-on tonight. So, Its going to be available in Kickstarter. @Peter: Vertus does not work while on the charging station, since it is charged by its 3.5mm jack when it is charged by the charging station. However Vertus WILL work while charging through its micro-USB port. @Bobo: No, that can't be done. @Elena: Kickstarter only lets each account to pledge on only one reward per project. @Evan: We've given couple of our prototypes to the anodizing and finishing facility and we're waiting for them to finish. It will be ready in about a week. Once its finished, we will post them in an update. @K.Alteholz-Martindale: That can be done. But, the main purpose of the full Vertus package is to spread the music in one area with two different speakers without wires. @Steven: When you use two Vertus receivers together in the TrueWireless Stereo Mode, they both play the same thing but in a stereo form collectively. Meaning if you have two speakers in one place and want to spread the music by putting your speakers apart from each other, they both will play the same music but one would be the left speaker and the other one the right speaker, making a stereo field collectively. Thank you everyone!! @Evan: We are working on the clip. I don't know if we can get it ready for Kickstarter but we are working on it. @Mark: That can be done! We will explain the details in the upcoming update. @Peter, Saleh, KYLee: We actually were going to offer an add-on Bluetooth transmitter (sender) for Vertus, but for marketing reasons and for eliminating confusion, we decided to not offer it. But after many requests for the transmitter function, it seems our backers really like that idea and for that we are thinking of offering it. @Yagami: Since we already had this planned and designed before starting Kickstarter, this is not going to cause any delays and most definitely there is not going to be any hesitation in making a great quality product! Everyone please stay tuned we are going to put an update soon regarding the transmitter add-on. Meanwhile thanks again, we're almost there!!! @Darshan : That is actually one thing that we're debating on now. In order to have phone conversations coming through car stereo, Vertus should have a call handling function and a microphone. The issue is that while some cars' AUX port is next to the stereo, others' AUX port is in the glove-box or in the dashboard, which would make the microphone on Vertus useless (if we choose to put a microphone). Another issue is that a lot of people prefer using Bluetooth headsets in order to keep their conversations private. So not putting the call handling function and a microphone in this case would be perfect, because the cellphone would automatically switch between the car stereo for music and the headset for calls. But if we enable the call handling function on Vertus, every time a call comes and you want to use your headset, you have to choose the headset from your cellphone and it wont be switched automatically. So what we are going to do is that, at the end of the campaign, we will send a survey about this and if the majority of our backers would like a microphone and call handling function on Vertus, we will make that happen! @KYLee : No, because Vertus receivers are not Bluetooth transmitters and are designed to receive Bluetooth Audio stream form devices such as smart phones, tablets, laptops and PCs that already have Bluetooth Audio streaming (sending) capability. For clarification: The charging station is an optional smart docking station for charging up to two Vertus receivers at the same time. And the cool thing is that it charges the receivers through their audio jacks. The charging station itself gets power through its micro-USB port. @David : Each Vertus receiver has a built-in battery that lasts at least 10 hours. The optional charging station is only for charging and doesn't have any batteries. @Jim Frye: Sure! I'll post the links soon. @Yagami : Of coarse Vertus can survive the vibrations of any kind, even much much higher than the vibrations that you mentioned. While the electronics inside the speaker work fine, Vertus will also work fine. @Nathan : Bluetooth 4.0 technology has two parts which are 1: the Legacy Bluetooth that we are using and 2: the Bluetooth low energy, which cannot be used for audio streaming and is mainly used for sensors. Also we are not using Bluetooth 3.0, because the TrueWireless Stereo technology uses Bluetooth 2.1 EDR (Enhanced Data Rate). @Yagami : We have couple of options for dust cap and once we choose the best solution we will let our backers know. @Sam : The charging station is an optional smart docking station for charging up to two Vertus receivers at the same time. And the cool thing is that it charges the receivers through their audio jacks. The charging station itself gets power through its micro-USB port. @rusty : Yes you're right, there is a micro-USB port on each Vertus receiver. @James Bailey, @LoganBlue: We like the transmitter and receiver idea and we might do it as a stretch goal for extra cost once we reach our goal! We'll keep you updated on that. @Chris : Thanks, don't worry they will work fine. @James : Thanks, Regarding your first request, each Vertus receiver can be used as a stereo Bluetooth receiver when it is in Stand-alone mode, and regarding your second request, our charging station does not contain a Bluetooth module, so it can't be used as a transmitter, but cool idea! @Mohammad: Thank you, we appreciate it!! @david: The reason we are using Bluetooth 2.1 is because at this point the True Wireless Stereo technology only supports Bluetooth 2.1. @Rusty : Yes, it will work fine. @Evan : Cool idea! Lets see what happens, we might put that as a stretch goal. @Yagami : Vertus can power all standard In-ears and over-the-head headphones. @Evan : Each receiver would come with a 3.5mm female-to-female adapter. So the full Vertus system will have two adapters included. @ Sandra : The best way to connect a Vertus receiver to a headphone is by connecting it by wire via the included 3.5mm female-to-female adapter. This is because the placement of the 3.5mm jack on headphones varies, and while Vertus can fit one headphone, it might not fit another one. @david : Because we are using premium grade components in making each Vertus, which are going to be machined and assembled in USA, it is really not possible for us to offer them at a lower cost for larger quantities. @ben1680 : We designed Vertus with the plug exposed to make it as small as possible. Also, Design-wise, this helps Vertus to easily merge with the connected speakers. Meanwhile, having the plug exposed shouldn't cause any issues. @Sandra : I just posted a photo with a Vertus receiver connected to an Apple headphones via a 3.5mm female-to-female adapter, which we are going to include in every package. @Sandra : For headphones, if you just want to use Vertus as a stand-alone Bluetooth stereo receiver to add Bluetooth capability to a non-Bluetooth headphone, it would work great! @David : Yes, we have charged and used the batteries many times without any loss of power. This is a good indication of the manufacturer's claim of being able to hold at least 80% power even after 500 10-hour usage cycles.This is the standard rating for all mobile consumer electronics. So don't worry, it's a really good battery. @ Yagami : Yes, either one of the receivers can work as a stand-alone Bluetooth stereo receiver. @Elena : Vertus only works with up to two speakers. @Yagami : Yes you can use either of the receivers as a standalone Bluetooth receiver. Also, there would be no latency between the Right and Left receivers. @Evan : Because Vertus doesn't have an amplifier inside, it can not be connected directly to a speaker that doesn't have an amplifier built-in. So our project wont make the Vamp obsolete in any way because Vamp has an integrated amplifier for connecting to speakers that are not self-powered. But, instead Vertus can be a great companion to Vamp for being able to use TWO Vamps at the same time. @David : I can assure you that our first run will be as good as the second and third run and the reason behind that is using an already engineered Bluetooth module that has gone through many phases and our extensive quality control process. @Sean : If you are in Canada, for free shipping, please adjust your pledge and choose (Ship to the US). @Kevin, Vertus will split the same Bluetooth audio to your two portable speakers in an all-Right and all-Left form and because the sound comes from two speakers instead of one, it will naturally make the sound louder. Thank you all for your support !! @Matthew @David @maarten @Mark : The CSR's TrueWireless Stereo technology is specifically designed to spread a stereo audio signal across two portable speakers in a form of one channel for each speaker. So, even tough you can use Vertus to form a multi-room system, it is not primarily designed for that purpose. In turn, Vertus is designed to spread the music in one area. @David : Yes, the range between the two units is the same as the range form the audio source to the first unit which is 30 feet. @maeerten : Vertus is meant to be used with portable speakers, which don't have optical input.
