We'll contact you through <email> and get you fixed up! Yes we have word from the California - Sammys are dropping: <url>ão for our Kickstarter fulfilment we opted for Royal Mail Max Sort and Standard Airmail options and I'm afraid we can't provide tracking codes with these options. However any purchases made from our website will get a tracking code :) @João we've asked our fulfilment partner if tracking numbers are available. Will update you asap :) @John thanks for your comment! Correct, we currently don't support Android version 5.0+ yet. We've actually made a Lollipop version but can't release it yet as Bluetooth behaves very differently on Android version 5.0 than it does on 4.0. We are working on fixing the issues right now and hope to release a new version of the BleepBleeps Android app that is compatible with 5.0+ in late May. <url>"design" (as you suggested @P.H) they approve final apps (mostly functionally) and then publish them on iTunes. The app has been built in tandem with the physical product over the last year but couldn't be finalised until the hardware was completed too. App approval is the last piece of the puzzle and we are having some positive dialogue with Apple as of last week. We hope to get approval any day now so we can start shipping to all our backers around the world. Can't wait for you all to meet Sammy! Tom and Team BleepBleeps @thurman we are using Backerkit to manage surveys and shipping addresses. You can edit your info here: <url>ánchez Ramírez: Android App is ready to rock and requires no approval so will be instantly live on Google Play when we start to ship.
