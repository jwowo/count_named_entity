Actually, we have to stick to plan and go in tier-order, so we're into the $1499/"First Production" units now, with "International" next. We're working on getting a CE mark for the International Units. David's correct. Many more machines built but we're out of Step Filters again until a big shipment arrives mid next week. This and other items will be covered in the next update shortly. @Albin: Address confirmed Ships passing in the night. See the update I just posted. Thanks for your understanding and support Mark and Larry. Despite our thorough testing in the lab, as a final "release checkpoint" to make sure the fixes we've made are everything that's needed, Jim, Avi and I each took home a production machine last weekend and brewed 2 batches in our kitchens (each). Worked like a charm. I just racked my PicoPale yesterday, carbed it overnight, and had some today....delicious! It's going to be a big test and ship week this week and I pledge to you an update Friday letting you know how many machines we got out the door. You have every right to demand updates David, but I appreciate the message. Only Jim, Avi and I from PicoBrew are allowed to respond to these comments, and I'm the only one who does Kickstarter updates, so we're the ones falling down on the communications. I just wanted to make sure that you know that a key reason Jim, Avi and I aren't on email/comments & project updates is that we're putting in 18 hour days trying to get our production problems all sorted out. Believe me, we're all looking forward to vacations once machines are churning out smoothly and everyone is happy....maybe I can hand deliver you your unit (before Christmas) as part of my vacation? :-) Thanks for bearing with us. Bill Any backers who would like to stop by and see the operation & where we are on shipping firsthand are welcome to stop by. We can't promise a great tour right now since we're all heads-down trying to get units out the door, and our premises are full of machines and parts, but as those of you who *have* stopped by to pick up your units know, we're 100% open about everything...We've just been very very busy debugging, testing and shipping.. @All – We are working on an update for later tonight which will include details associated with TASC, our new production facility, and our venture to partner with another larger capacity production facility. @David Black - Hey David, our new production facility took a little longer to get off the ground than they expected it would take. Thus far, we've shipped a total of 38 Zymatics and are testing the next 16 in house. We're working on getting another larger production facility on-line and will keep you posted as this develops. @Elliott – As we have communicated before, PicoBrew accounts are associated with individual Zymatics and thus cannot be created until we have specific serial numbers for the Zymatic it will be associated with. Due to this, we are creating accounts for entire tiers as we reach them. This not only allows for us to associate with Zymatics being constructed but also allows for us to respond efficiently to questions posed by brewers who have received their machines and need immediate assistance. If anyone has questions, the best way to reach us is by emailing us at <email>. We appreciate your continued patience during this hectic yet exciting time and will keep you up to date as new information surfaces. -The PicoBrew Team Ingredient kits: You don't *need* to buy kits! We put these together strictly for customer convenience, so that you can just click a link and pre-packaged ingredients arrive on your doorstep. This saves you having to go to the homebrew store with your recipe, selecting and grinding your grain there, selecting your hops and yeast there, and taking it all home before you can brew. We are not licensing these exclusively to Mountain Homebrew -- the goal is to just get the kits out and available online for people. If you have a favorite homebrew shop that would like to carry the kits, point them our way and we'll see if we can hook them up. In the meantime, we like Mountain and shop-owner Jon Mendrick and we're very happy that they're carrying the kits. Here's a link: <url>#420 depends on how fast we can get a 3rd source online. Right now we assemble/test at PicoBrew at ~15/week and TASC (our 2nd source) at approx. 25/week. So that's a 160/mo rate. We're looking at 2 different higher volume "3rd sources" to replace Schippers, (our original 1st source) to get us another 100-200/mo. So with what we have today (Picobrew + Tasc) unit #420 would ship the 2nd week of Oct. If we can sign one of the 3rd sources we could potentially shave a month or more off of that. Hand-assembled units continue to be shipped, but the big news is that we're starting up the line today at our assembly factory....big day for us! We'll do an update today with pictures and details..... Yes, the heater core is different for the 220/240v units David, sorry for the slow response. @Hugh Keg sleeve will be coming with the PicoBrew Zymatic shipment. @Larry & all Thank you for your continual support; we couldn't have done this without you. First customer shipment will be happening shortly with access to the forums and recipe crafter for all shortly after. We'd love to have precision for you David, but the plastics holdup makes our final dates hard to gauge. Since we're about 2 months behind on plastics, I think it is likely that we're going to be about 2 months behind on our overall targets (end of March vs. end of Jan for first units shipping). The silver lining, if there is one, is that we're not sitting on our thumbs as we wait: We've been testing, fixing bugs and making product improvements. Also, we've been creating new recipes for the recipe database (13 award-winners so far not including Annie Johnson's recipes!) You are going to like our update today Brandon! No special machine requirements! You can log into your account on www.picobrew.com from even a tablet or smartphone. As far as getting early access to the RecipeCrafter: we create accounts and match them to machines as the machines are shipped. It may be possible to create all accounts at once and leave them un-associated with machines prior to shipping, but we'll have to look into this... Hi Leslie!! Just sent you a message about your shirt's delivery status!! I'll be posting an update later today but... . No plastics yet....that's the long pole....switched to Eastman Tritan for the (originally) Polycarbonate parts to make sure we don't have a BPA issue (esp for Europe). Expecting parts now the week of the 20th. Switched pumps in Dec as well to address some long-term reliability issues and it's a race to get the new parts in volume before Golden Week factory shutdowns in China. Everything else is proceeding as expected, everyone is heads-down. Hi Steven. Happy to share. The final CAD for the long-lead tooled parts is out although we’re still negotiating some cosmetic details with the toolmaker. We still expect to see FOT ("first off tool") parts in early January. Reliability testing, assembly, software development and additional recipe development continues on schedule. Our recipe calculator accounts for grain absorption, trub and other losses to give you a specific amount of starting water to place in your keg that will ultimately yield 2.5G of finished beer. Taster sets ship for December 2013. No problem. Thanks all for the kind words. Cole - its not automatic, but you can definitely do it. For a one time experiment it would be pretty easy to add a manual diverter valve on the way to the keg to let you pull off wort for decoction or turbid mashing, then just dump it back into the keg. If you really wanted, you could also update the open source firmware to run some electronic controlled valves and go to town. Thanks Nils! That's great information! To all of our international backers, we've already started meeting with carriers and are going to work hard to find competitive rates and get your goods across safely with the least work possible on your end. Unfortunately it takes time to compare and negotiate for the best rates so we won't have any numbers until long after the campaign closes. And you are certainly welcome to use your own freight forwarder if that makes more sense for you. Jonathan - during the boil, near-boiling temperature water is pumped from the keg, through the heat exchanger to control temperature exactly, dropped against a series of mesh screens (aiding the "vigorousness" with the hops cage and an additional filter, and then drained back into the keg. the venting is twofold. one is out the top of the step filter and also out the top of the keg where we also collect and trap some volatiles in the foam (keeping it from re-entering the beer). I wish there was an easy way for you to taste our kolsch or pilsner as that would probably settle it without question. Matthew. -- We shorten the dip tubes on the keg and that works quite well for transferring without trub. You could use a plate chiller inline but we've had great results with a simple immersion chiller which is a lot more water efficient unless you have a glycol chilling loop for your plate chiller (though the immersion chiller does require ice). Hi Hugh. There is venting on the back and sides as well as the front. Hi Ninjah. There's a pretty good mix of custom and off the shelf parts, most of the parts that could wear are off the shelf but there are some custom seals as well. We've done quite a bit of testing (and component changes accordingly) in the hundreds of batches we have run in the lab and are going to do more rigorous reliability testing as the production parts get finalized and hope to be able to fix any issues long before you get your machine. And, of course we'll make spares and repair parts available. Hi Julian. That's a smaller capacity keg in the video. In most cases you'll want a 5G keg for brewing and fermenting. We buy most of our 5G cornies used, because you can get them for < $50 ea that way, but when we buy new places like MoreBeer have good prices ($110 now for 5G) <url>"w x 17"h x 14.5"d and about 50lbs. As far as building them in: we know our friend and KS backer Jeff Bowlby, owner of Abodian (www.abodian.com) is excited about offering Zymatic as a built-in to his custom cabinetry, so it's possible. Keep in mind that just like ovens/microwaves there are heat and vapor venting issues to deal with. Software-wise, in response to J Wynia's question: Developers rock, and we definitely welcome you! The firmware will be released open-source with the machines first ship (frankly, it's not too useful until you have a machine to run it on). On the web-side we've written software for recipe import, creation and sharing, data logging and brew session viewing. We're working on the Web APIs that will allow you to do your own thing on the web side without having to rewrite the entire firmware stack (which, btw, you will also be able to do if you so desire). Craig... Yes, we've updated this in our FAQ and would be happy to have any of you pick up your machine from our office in Seattle. Chris... We're engineers and scientists, not lawyers and accountants. We'll do what those people tell us to. Hi Eric. Glad you are excited about it. Yes, of course we'd be thrilled to have you get a t-shirt and growler with your machine. Just add the relevant costs to your pledge and we'll give you a spot on the backer survey to let us know what you'd like. Thanks! Crank up the clone machine 101 'best' beers in America <url>" and you will know when your (product's) in transit because we will send you an email with the tracking #s on it." Yes that's why I posted a comment here. I am one of the earliest international backers but haven't got an email when my picobrew would be shipped out and based on the numbers, I would have been notified and received it. Ronnie, See the UPDATES (54) page...it's second from the left, above. Backer log in is necessary. Some of the international units have been sent.. (there's a map w.some of the countries)....notice the last update for more info...hope this helps A. Hi First production is all sent, when are you delivering the international backers ? Hi backers, Just want to let you all know how happy my brewing partner and I are with our Zymatic. It's worth the wait. I have been brewing since the winter of 2000/2001. We received our Zymatic in late August and have brewed 8 brews (7 recipes). We have been able to drink 5 so far after bottle conditioning, and every one tastes as good or better than what we have brewed using our traditional set up. The Just Squeezed recipe is fantastic. There's some good info on the Picobrew forum after signing in. Lots of tricks from those of us who have been picobrewing for a while. And Annie has posted good overview videos (which you don't need to sign in for). If you plan on brewing more than one 2.5 gallon recipe in a month, I recommend either buying a second brew keg (shorten the tube as instructed) or transferring cooled wort to sanitized standard fermentation vessels like a carboy, etc. Finally, if you run into any problems, just send Picobrew a support ticket (accessed through the sign in portal). Picobrew responds really really quickly his way. They have been my single best customer service experience in memory. Cheers, Mark M Dear Creator, i responded your survey (18/10) for international backers but haven't received an answer from you. i basically would like to get the REFUND at this time. I don't feel safe importing PicoBrew without all the certifications specially living in Australia. If i get something broken or faulty product on delivery it'll be hard dealing the issue from Australia. I reckon that the wisest move at this time is wait a few years until PicoBrew get all certifications and stablished in the market before I order one. It's a very hard decision to make because my wife and I were dreaming about it... We're beer lovers. Waiting for your reply, Regards Marcus Dunno if anyone else has seen this kickstarter, but the CO2 pressurized growler's look GREAT! <url>"picobrew" if they sent the info/password to you, you should find it there. You also have to sign a user agreement. Anthony, usually just enter your user name and password. Having said that, it doesn't seem to recognize either of mine, tonight. Those being 1. my email address or 2. my screen name from here. They did mention that the access is set up on shipment of your unit. Unless that has changed. How does one get there picobrew.com account? Link for the KIRO video >Start Ups <url>"Shipping Update #8: Schedule and More" there is a photo at Engadget Live Seattle event that shows a box with three tap heads. What was that box and does and is it a refrigeration device? @donevan - I'm taking a stab that I'm about 325 based on looking at the funding $ chart on kicktraq and the date I backed On that basis I'm guessing I am currently a late September / early October ship ie still 2 - 2.5 months to wait :( Sorry you have to deal with bad contractors! I'm so happy that you schooled them in how people with integrity deal with that kind of shadiness. Thank you for being awesome! How do you determine what unit number you will receive? I think I was one of the first in line for the first production run putting me in the low 100's. I haven't heard anything regarding delivery (I live in Seattle so prefer to pick up). Based on the updates, I'd expect to hear something by now. Thanks Steven - just buy the ingredients at your local hbs ? - it just won't be a kit Regarding the ingredient kits, will they be available from other suppliers or only Mountain Homebrew? Otherwise I have to go through some awkward freight forwarding services to get it into Europe. Has anyone still here received theirs yet ? Any comments on how it is going ? Any PicoBrew owners in Chicago area let me know, I'm installing mine at the home brew store I manage and would love to have other Pico owners in the area meet up for discussion and brew sessions! The store is Grow Masters in Gurnee btw and do have the best ingredient selection in Midwest. Let's have a homebrew suviche some steaks and talk PicoBrewing! I agree with Alan A brief update would be great. How many have shipped, how many people have access to the website, any new issues that change previous time estimates etc..? thanks Hi, Can we get an update on the shipping status? It's more than understandable if there are additional issues being encountered! But what is key at this point is that you routinely communicate with updates since you have primed the community for 'pending' receipt of their orders :). Letting two or more weeks pass after announcing commencement of initial shipping suggests that there is not an internally established process of external communication to the community. Is there a timeline for providing the web APIs and firmware source code per the original FAQ? Shipping status update would be great if possible..... How is production going? About time for another status update? Excited to get my PicoBrew...any update on early access to the forums and recipe crafter for those of us still awaiting delivery of our units? I want my PicoBrew! I've got a fever, and the only prescription is more automated home brew beer! Ignore the �......... Congratulations on starting up the line � Bump on my question re voltages.. Hi PicoBrew - a thought, for those of us that are 220/240v do you need to do many changes to the 110/120v unit or are all of the components dual voltage ? Thanks Hi PicoBrew Now that you've started to ship some units and solved most (hopefully!) of the problems do you have any revised shipping dates for each of the kickstarter levels ? The pre-order store says pre-orders deliver August and general availability September so I assume that would put the last kickstarter units as no later than August ? Any info. would be great thanks David ABV potential is going to be a function of batch size. You can make whatever style you want but your final volume will be limited by the fixed amount of grain you can fit in the step filter. Also, no reason why you cannot add additional malt extract or sugar adjuncts during the boil phase to increase original gravity. Hello, I thought this was mentioned at some point, but I can't remember and I haven't had luck finding it - what is the highest ABV possible with the picobrew? Will old ales or barleywines be possible? Thanks! Please don't rush these out with a bunch of bugs. Get it right and then get them to us. JMG I have been convinced from the beginning that this was a great idea and backed it because of the solid background the team brought to the table. After the backers bash it was evident this was going to happen. I have a lot of folks I have shared this with, that I can tell are doubting. I don't mind waiting for the final product cause it will be right. Thank you guys for not rushing and half stepping or compromising. would love to get the gluten free recipe. I've just stumbled across this podcast with @Picobrew - <url>"everything on track" it would be great to know how things are going ! I saw in an earlier comment that you were expecting FOT parts in early Jan - is that still on track ? Thanks David Got my kegerator for Xmas and found out on Xmas eve that I got into the graduate diploma university course in brewing I applied for :) Looking forward to experimenting in 2014 with the PicoBrew :) I didn't mean to rename your company... I meant PicoBrew. Just got my growler and tasting set in the mail. Everything arrived safe and sound. Happy Holidays to everyone at PickBrew! Chris You attach a 5G keg but it was always clear (at least to me) that it made 2.5G ? Cheers David Hello, In response to this post "Our recipe calculator accounts for grain absorption, trub and other losses to give you a specific amount of starting water to place in your keg that will ultimately yield 2.5G of finished beer" I thought the Picobrew made 5G of beer in each run? Hi PicoBrew! Thank you so much for the awesome backers bash this weekend! We had a lot of fun and it was great to talk to everyone on the team. The beer was amazing; much better than anything I've managed to brew with friends in our limited attempts so far. I'm looking forward to the arrival of the machine and can't wait to start our first brew! Thanks again! Attended the backer bash yesterday, and now I'm even more excited - I didn't think it was possible. It was great to talk to everyone there - team members especially, but also other backers. Everyone I went with agreed on a favorite - gluten free Epiphany - but our second places were as varied as the styles (personally was a big fan of the Maharaja Brown and Short & Stout). I can't wait to be making some of these amazing beers at home (and experimenting with my own)! Thanks everyone at Picobrew for the wonderful night - the tour, the talk, and of course the beer. Keep up the great work! What's the ETA on the backer "gifts"? I'm hoping to get Christmas early :) Cheers! How much information can we expect to get with regards to production status and scheduling. Will you tell us when you expect to approve FOT parts, pass MDVT etc and when you actually do. I know we are not entitled to any of that information but I'm feeling slightly burned by an Indiegogo project I backed a while ago that has slipped on its schedule. How do the water volumes work? Do you fill the keg with a specific amount of water for a specific recipe? If less water is absorbed than needed, does it just dilute the wort? Been trying to get my head around this part. Attended the first backer bash last night. It was great to meet the team behind this project. Tasted some great beers; Party Porter, Short and Stout, and D_____ Amber were my particular favorites. Jim's "PicoBrewed" pork was also fantastic! Now I really can't wait for for my Zymatic. Did the backer event happen ? Looking forward to seeing photos and video from this weekends backer event !! I can't make it there; can I delegate my backer bash invite to a friend that lives up there? Any news on the dates of the backer events? Looks like my Dec 6th and 7th opened up. What should we enter on the survey if we don't plan on making it to any of the backer events? The survey gives an error that all required fields must be populated if I don't select any of the dates. Are the dates for the backer events in the survey for sure dates? As in go ahead and buy a plane ticket? Please don't pick the 7th, that's the MLS final! Unless, of course, you're just bitter after the Timbers trounce the Sounders tomorrow. ;) What survey ? Did I miss something or did it not go to international backers ? Won't be able to make any of those dates in the survey for the bash. Bummer. A good article on picobrew and the recipes that will be coming with our units. Cant wait to start brewing with it. <url>"picobrew" community started on Google+. File under wishful thinking>> How about parties-D&P shows in NYC and Chicago/Omaha for those of us not fortunate enough to live on the Left Coast? Was perusing the Nomiku site, and that's something they mentioned. And for the internationals...go global! Congratulations on being funded! On behalf of the international backers, big thank you for arranging the shipping procedures! Wishing you guys success in reaching the next stretch goal. Is the date right on the taster set, 2014? Hoping to get a Christmas gift. Is there anyway to do more complicated mashes such as decoction or turbid? I can't imagine how that would be possible. Thanks for the update on shipping and congratulations on breaking $600k !! Thanks for the update on shipping and congratulations on breaking $600k !! I just signed up yesterday but if there is anyone else in the UK wondering about shipping, it’s not that complex to arrange, or terribly expensive: You need to find a Freight Forwarder (I’m going to use PH Logistics UK Limited, as I know through my work as an Export manager, Tel: (44) 121 764 7033), or alternatively go to someone like DHL / UPS. They will want the Tariff Code that determines the Duty and this is 8479899790 (<url>#import) and will cost you 1.7%. Unfortunately HMRC will then want 20% Tax on the cost of goods, so expect that to be around £200. Whoever you use, you want to ask for the transport to be “Ex Works” as this means they will arrange to collect from PicoBrew in Seattle and deliver to the address you specify (be sure to ask whoever arranges the transport to also include insurance unless you want to organise this yourself). The final delivery address can account for up to as much as 50% of the transport cost, so no two quotes will be the same but my expectation for door to door / Ex Works transport (including insurance) will be in the region of $200 to $300. That brings the total delivered cost of the Zymatic to around £1350 / £1,400. @Alex I'll be getting some of these instead: <url>"third" Hector's suggestion. I second Hector's suggestion. Would be a lovely though to be able to get going once we get the picobrew. Nearer shipping a website / forum to swap hints / tips / recipes etc would be great (or a dedicated area on an existing home brew forum) ? A keg and ingredients for the first recipe would be awesome for the 600k stretch goal! I know you've mentioned DMS in the FAQ, but can you clarify exactly how the wort flow functions during the "boil", and at what point that enables evaporation of volatiles? My understanding is that the wort is exposed to air while passing through the hop compartments, and the claim is that there's enough exposure there for DMS control... this is pretty much the only thing keeping me on the fence. Do you have a recipe database already built that we could see? :) Two quick questions: 1) I've heard that, for keg fermentation, a cask widge float works really nice to avoid getting a lot of trub. Would that interfere with the picrobrew during operation? Granted that using a 5g should have plenty of room to attach afterwards. 2) Would an in-line plate chiller work to cool the wort as it goes back? And we made it 500k ! Holy cow! I thought this might stall out around 450k, but it just keeps heading up, up, up. I can't wait to pop that first cold one next spring. David, or other, if one is patient...lol...Ocean freight shipping is reasonable, and I note they have a drop off in Seattle. Their site indicates country specials, now and again. regular price is $353 min. <url>"timed" in any fashion. From the webpage screenshot it looks like timing for the hops is in there but from the pictures I don't see how those compartments would be timed properly. Would that still have to be manual? I also wondered why the 5G keg seems to be a requirement? My consumption isn't high enough to justify a 5G brew so I hope we could brew smaller batches still. @Anthony Salter - Malt is part of the grain bill, and must make up 50% of the bill to be considered beer. Other grains are considered adjuncts. This is the Kickstarter that convinced me to create an account. Cheers! Wow, tough call guys... All three generous offers, a commemorative Tee would be nice, but I would have to go with the extra equipment! Thanks! Rod Foster Any of those 400k rewards would be cool, but I'll vote for the cool green oled. I should say hops + grain + malt + water = wort (+ yeast) = beer...error on my formula :-) Hey QQ: how / when / does malt play into this whole deal? I know when I've been homebrewing at Gallagher's in Edmonds, WA. the ingredients are hops + grain + malt + = wort (+ yeast) = beer. Does the machine not need malt? Or how does that work? Thanks - am SO SO excited to get my PicoBrew. 500k Stretch Goal Vote. • an extra brewing/fermenting keg lid and airlock Also please include a Keg and ingredients for first recipe for all levels of machine. Oh yeah, stretch goal complete. Seems like there is time for another one... Does it vent only from the front or is there venting out the rear as well? I was wondering about the Zymatic's long-term serviceability. How much of the device is composed of custom-made pieces vs off-the-shelf parts that I could find replacements for, should they fail? The things that come to mind as likely failure-through-use points would be the water pump(s), heating element(s), valves, any soft-sealing tracks or o-rings exposed to heat, etc. I learned about Pico Brew a few weeks ago but was on the fence about getting one. But then I was at the Great American Beer Festival this weekend as a volunteer pouring beer and who should wander by but Dr Chris White. I poured him a beer and asked him what he thought of the device. He said it looked promising from his prototype and that he had used the copy White Labs has. I asked if he thought it was worth it and he said I should consider it. So now I'm a backer looking forward to my Pico to be delivered in April. In your photos and video, the keg shown is shorter and wider than the 5G keg in the link below. Are the kegs you're showing a different capacity? I've only seen 2.5G kegs that shape. The machine is outside of my brew budget, but as a homebrewer and Arduino dabbler, I'm happy to support your project. Good luck with the manufacturing! Where do you source your 5g Cornelius kegs from? I haven't been able to find one the shape you show in the video. I've only found the ones that are taller and skinnier. Is your company thinking of producing a larger Zymatic in the future? I know that shipping cost will be calculated once they are ready to go, but do you have even a rough ballpark of what it will be? are we looking at an additional $50, $100.. or even more? Just trying to figure a ballpark of what it will cost in total for the Picobrew. It says you're going to include wireless networking with the Zymatic, but are you going to be keeping the ethernet port as well? What else will I need to finish my beer with the machine and the add ons? What is a good container to ferment the brew and what else might be needed to have an End to end process working? Thanks! I'm excited to be in the second production group with some friends! We had a couple of questions (at least for now :)): - What kind of anti-foam and foam collapser does it come with? - Is there a way to get additional keg lids so we can ferment multiple batches at a time? Thanks!! You guys might be interested in this other Kickstarter going on: <url>#2 in this weeks top new crowdfunding projects list: <url>"favorites". I have been begging for a Zymatic test unit for months....so now I get my chance. The guys have been kind enough to us (as a vendor) to keep us supplied in some sample brews and each one is better than the last. I _love_ this. I've been dreaming about making my own delicious beer for years, and now I can, amazing! This is probably the coolest thing I've ever seen. I have a friend who brews and has quite an extensive series on Youtube that I enjoy watching. Still, I've been intimidated to venture into it. Until this! I have a quick question about the backing levels. Does the Zymatic kit levels come with any of the other backer levels (i.e. growler, shirts, glasses)? It would be cool to rep the new system we'll be making our friends before we get it. If not, maybe consider it as a stretch goal? Great Seattle Times article on PicoBrew: <url>
