I am very happy to see you made it. Is there any type of tools you will be looking for? I hit a lot of garage sales and sometimes come across good deals. I also have a friend at work that buys mechanics and machines tools boxes when they retire and than parts them out on e-bay to sell them off . I know he has a lot of files and general tools left over that I might be able to get a good price on. E-mail me at <email> and/or you can call my cell at 815-540-6921. Best of luck to you.
