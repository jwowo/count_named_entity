Sorry for the unmet expectations Vickie. We tried to be transparent about the selection but could have been more descriptive. We decided when building the project to stay away from glass for two reasons. We had a lot of trouble with breakage at past events (both in shipping and use) and the cost would have made for a pretty prohibitive price point. We're really proud of the type of plastic and density of glasses that we ended up with. Anything that could break too easily was set aside as an option as we wanted these to be robust as well as easily washable and therefore reusable. All that said, please email me at <email> and we can work out a refund if you aren't satisfied. We aim to please. Cheers! Kevin + Stephen - Thanks for the friendly ask on updates. You should have a big ole one in your inbox tonight. More to come every 2-3 weeks. Cheers! I'm disappointed. Everything I read about this product said glasses, but these are plastic tasting cups. Liked the packaging and the rest of the product. I'm just disappointed and wish these were truly tasting glasses. Got mine ! What is the latest news on the project? Any news or updates ?? @creator Ryan and Mike. Any news on how the project is going? Congrats to the BB team!!!
