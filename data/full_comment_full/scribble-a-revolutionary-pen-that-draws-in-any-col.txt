Beginning of the new video looks like there is a small display that shows the selected color in real time. Looked real. Then later in the video they change the color of the entire pen and slide the graphic off of the pen to show some feature. I wonder how much money these guys have pulled in through this whole process. I just got an email from these guys with a new attempt. While I would love for this to be real the video looks highly edited and you cannot see whether or not the pen is actually functional. Same scam tactics. I wonder if anyone in the beta program ever actually got a product as I know they kept pushing it back and back. Aaaand, they're back with another crowdfunding scam attempt! Looks like they're never going to give up on this. I admire their tenacity, if nothing else. <url>"pre-orders" are going through an Indian company that simply does drag and drop form creation, yet uses a domain that sounds like they are in some way related to the Scribble mission! I also love the fact that they haven't changed their video in any way to get rid of the super obvious visual glitches that existed back from when it was on Kickstarter. I really hope no one pays these scam artists a dime. Looks like they have set up "pre-orders" on their own website now. Seems as sketchy as ever given they still lack any say... actual information or demonstrations of it functioning. look out for this guy's other scams: <url>"take the money and run" scheme. Too bad about Scribble. They should have been honest. I'm sure that there are folks that would not have minded funding their R&D. I wouldn't be one of them though since a team that hides their identity is a team that has something to hide. I also suspect that their target amount is unrealistically low for the obstacles they would need to surmount. @Claire, according to the cancelled tilt campaign, the final retail price for the pen is $399. Even if they were able to pull it off, it'd be a hard sell at that price... On a side note, can anyone tell me what the heck "DOU" stands for? I assumed it was a misspelling of "duo", but they had it in this campaign at the tilt campaign, and even referenced it in updates and comments as "DOU". What am I missing? So their tilt campaign canceled too...sounds like super fishy business. I hope it works I hope someday that it comes out. and I will be happy to pay the $150 full price for it, but I'd be putting money through a shredder if I ever funded a campaign Tell me about it, Dragonbait. Having been following the sad discussion on Indiegogo about Ritot, there's adamant denial going on. No matter how many technically-minded people try to assure that it would demand bending laws of physics for Ritot guys to pull it off. And even the production timeframe is simply silly. Sure, one has to be optimist while funding crowdsourcing projects, supporting aspiring engineers and their vision, but that doesn't have to include stupidity and ignorance. Trouble is some people treat these campaigns in the same way as they treat religion. They will ignore commen sense, ignore logic, ignore anyone who says anything negative and only listen to people who say what they want to hear. All because they are desperate for the end result to be real. It's cute that Scribble again claims that Tilt was being obstinate just as Kickstarter before them, and that Scribble was the one who finally pulled the plug versus the other way around, and that Tilt was in fact the one that went radio silent on them and has yet to respond... Funny, since Tilt's blog post was in fact published before Scribbles... And acting like "sure, we didn't have a prototype, that's no biggie. Trust is, making two wildly different designs can't take more than 6 months from concept to your doorstep, right?" Is no big deal... And yet best of all, they disclaim the whole thing with how they have 2 years of work on the "product" under their belt. Just what work would that be exactly, since they have noting to show for it besides an idea that they don't fully understand, explaining why they are so easily tripped up on details, and some renders that they try to pass off as a "working" prototype through entrepreneurial enthusiasm. Guess that when you have no issues lying your ass off at every turn to earn a few bucks, what's some "creative" spin against an ex-vendor? Really look forward to see who invests in these guys who have a history of repeatedly lying to their customer base, vendors and partners about their status... What am I thinking, they're sure to succeed in the business world, as they've already mastered what most companies don't figure out for a good couple years; that the name of the game is maximizing shareholder value at all costs. Certainly want to stay a long ways away from these guys, that's for sure. Too bad that we'll probably never know who they really were. I don't think Scribble Entrepreneurs are scammers. It take effort to set up their nicely done website and to be featured in tech websites. I believe they are in design stage and need the funds to produce a prototype. If that's the case they should just tell us rather than create a fake video or claim something they are unable to do yet. Or use the Indiegogo Flexible Funding crowdfunding. Either way, I didn't back them post kickstarter. Ya, just saw that tilt took them down for not showing any actual information. Good for them. Guess we get to see how this drama continues. Looks like trey admitted to not having a prototype <url>"yep, all this stuff that wasn't adding up = scam, and we don't want to be a part of that". Scribble "could" have responded in a week's time and saved their campaign *if* they actually had something. Drawing two lines with an existing pen isn't that hard... Faking one in a convincing fashion, single cut wise isn't that hard, and they had that option... showing their pen live, in person, to Tilt on Tilt's dime so they don't need to make a video really isn't hard if they really had the product but suck at running a camera, or don't know how to share it when they're done. But they couldn't do any of those things, in a week. So, yeah... Certainly, definitely 100% Fake with no chance of reaching market from this team. And it's awesome that Tilt not only called them out on it but did a blog post on it from their CEO. Actually gives me a lot of respect for them and moves them up considerably in the typical crowdfunding arena for me! Too bad that we don't also know the full names of the parties involved so that we know to look out for them in the future in all future dealings. And they are back on Facebook again. Made a comment, but they removed it in minutes and blocked me. Maybe on twitter? #ScribbleScam that took a bit of time, but they've finally been put out to pasture. Woo! Shut down by Tilt. I think that's the final nail in the coffin for these scriminals. There's that! They weren't honest about their names or country, but agreeing to refunds when the campaign closes (which itself was pushed by an extra 2 weeks because...) is pretty awesome of them. /me rolls eyes On a tiny (microscopic) positive side - at least they seem to be honest in returning money to people asking for it. I especially like that they're a DLP that functions at *extremely* sharp angles without typical parallax concerns, or that their product will be "in focus" no matter what angle you have your wrist at. As a quick piece of sanity checking on that one, to better understand the engineering issues involved with this problem, place your cell phone's camera on top of your wrist where the projector would be in this product, turn on the camera and start to record video. Click on the top of your hand to get it to focus on your hand. Now, try to keep the top of your hand as flat as you possibly can when you move it from your hand being open and fully flat and in-line with your wrist, and form a fist. Watch what your hand does, the various rotations and curves that take place, those minute changes that occur across the horizontal axis, or the increase in angle of your palm. Pay attention to the video and how you've lost *most* of that visible surface area, if not all of it. There are ways around that, such as by using different lens types (including fisheye, prism, and some very cool multifocal convex ones through the use of multiple lenses stacked or custom grinds!) but the bottom line is that if you can't get *mostly* there with a conventional lens, you aren't going to get there with a custom one. When you lose the ability to see the top of your hand, the Ritot projector would have lost the ability to shoot light at your hand too. Light moves in a strait line. It doesn't go around curves, over hills and ridges, or whatever else (except in every specific relativistic scenarios!) What they show is violations of both General and Special Relativity, at various points in their materials, which is frankly hilarious! So, the take away is that their product couldn't possibly exist for a massive, massive number of reasons. Considering how much money they've raised, it's almost worth sitting down and doing that kind of a write-up just for the fun of it though since it would be worth a laugh to see how people respond to the implication that this team has proven Einstein, Maxwell, Newton, Hawking, and untold others wrong through a $120 watch that among violating maximum energy density of lithium also both discovered and harnessed the power of anti-photons. At the same point, campaigns don't get cancelled even in the face of overt scamminess because companies like Kickstarter and Indiegogo just want their commission on the campaigns and treat it like "backer beware". So, is it really worth spending the 30+ hours to really do that right when it's something that I only vaguely find amusing when it truly will make no difference whatsoever? Stuff that I'm passionate about, sure, I'll spend the time on it even if it doesn't ultimately pan out, just because one day it might actually turn into a real product, and I'd love that! But something that could never, ever, EVER work? Hmm... My favorite part is how it can provide notifications from your phone, but you still need to connect it to its base station to change the color of the displayed time. ...and just think...Ritot overcame all those challenges simply to create a watch that projects the time on your hand! Sure, it does other things, but in essence... If Ritot is for real, then congrats, we can officially shut it all down... Everything, everywhere! They've officially solved the energy density issues, material density, wireless transmissions through insulated materials, parallax, and best of all they've been able to create a light repulsive field! We just need to sit back and wait for them, because they've singlehandedly disproved quantum mechanics! With their obvious implications, we're months away from faster than light travel, instaneous extremely high bandwidth communications, and otherwise completely changing everything that we know about the nature of reality. And damn, that's exciting! By the way, I'm being sarcastic if you couldn't tell. There is no chance that they've overcome these problems to create a product that would function as they've claimed. It defies physics at every turn. If it were 4x the size, most of its physics issues go away, leaving you with "just" parallax, light propagation across uneven surface, ambient light and the "negative light" concerns. Pekka- I just had to look them up to see what you were talking about. The online reviews/posts about it are incredibly similar to this Scribble campaign! It's interesting the email I got yesterday about the beta testing. I said "hey, lets see what this is all about" just for the hell of it I attempted to send in my info and it wont allow me to. Keeps saying there is a captcha error but I entered it correctly multiple times. Divine intervention is stepping in here LOL As a curiosity - have you guys heard of this project of pending doom: <url>"handwriting" focused pen instead of an "art" pen. That's not necessarily a bad thing as I do a whole lot of diagrams and markups, and "virtual" paintings. The bottom line is that there are great pens out there, that have wonderful capabilities. When they *must* be used in conjunction with a tablet, you already have access to the Tablet hardware, including it's image sensors which can be used for the sampling. Apps like ArtRage and ProCreate have this functionality today and presumably others do as well. They can do this using either the rear camera and choosing any point on the picture, or by switching to the front camera and using the screen as a flash to help provide more accurate color accuracy through a known light source and distance from the object. It isn't as "cool" as a dedicated spectrophotometer, but a dedicated spectrophotometer is just a camera that has been pre-calibrated to know exactly how it behaves with known lighting conditions. However, if one is looking for a product that is a stylus that is also a spectrophotometer, then at the moment Mozbii likely is your best shot at getting an actual product on your doorstep at the end of the day. And I'm not saying that it's a bad product, just a boring product. It doesn't travel any new ground. It doesn't conquer any unexplored territories, or do anything that is frankly "new". To the same end, there are a *LOT* of boring products out there. I've made a bunch of boring products. I've also made some exciting products. Mozbii is taking the road that has already been traveled hundreds of times before. The Scribble Ink *would have* traveled new ground *if* it was real. And the odds of it being real, even with the new Beta email that they just sent out is still so far in the absurdly unlikely range. If there was *any* chance that it was real, they would have shown something real instead of needing to fake the hands in their video. I mean, faking hands??? Last I checked, most people have those... really easy to come by... And the final cementing thing in my mind, the top of their "prototype" pen that they showed had no image sensor where they *could* have captured a color. If they had a prototype that was vaguely capable of working, they would have shown it instead of faking everything. Because of that, the Beta seems "far fetched" to say the least. I want it to be true, since I want the product... I really, really want the product, but odds are that it won't be coming from them considering their insistence against sharing any technical info or a "real" video. And then to finish off this post with a couple more nitpicks that I've noticed from the Scribble Video and Marketing Materials: The pen is a "roller ball", yet the nib is a strait opening. No actual item that could be depressed. And with the angle that the artist was drawing, said ink would have been deposited to the edges of the opaque plastic nib. @jennifer on the submit form they ask to pick between us and international. I can just smell all the shipping charges they will be asking for in advance. Just imagine al those poor unfortunate souls sending $15 - $20 for a beta product that will never be delivered. on first glance people will think of it as a "cheap" way to acquire the pen... If all the current backers, according to the new site, would just pay for shipping it would be 1270x$20 makes for a nice $25400. but that's just an assumption. I haven't actually filled out the form (and i don't intend to) so i could be wrong. I suspect it'll more likely be a "closed beta" with an NDA, so conveniently no one can talk about it (i.e., there won't actually be any beta testers). If they're really able to beta test it, then why the heck can't they provide a video of the real deal? Yeah, me too! Beta Tester indeed...I wonder what the big catch will be. I expect something like "we've chosen you to be a beta tester for Scribble, but notice you haven't sent us any money yet. Kindly send us $150 and you can test a Scribble pen when it's ready." We'll see if anyone actually gets one to test. Just got a new scribble message. I bet everyone here is just dying to become beta testers... *sarcasm achievement unlocked* @Endless, Check out Node, its a little device with various attachable sensors, one of those is Chroma that scans colours and displays them on your phone or ipad, just like the fake video that scribble did. The only difference is it doesn't functions as a stylus (which is not necessarily a bad thing) and you can attach different sensors (such as gas detection IR thermometer etc). It's great, I got them through KS and they work exactly as advertised. <url>"ink" pen that changes color way, but just the fact that it can capture almost any shade of color was super exciting regardless, especially considering I haven't seen anything on the market that does it yet, and it's more than useful for that function alone with the creative projects I work on. With having little nieces too, I can see it being popular to play with on visits as well. But that's just me speaking for me, I was beyond excited for the scribble stylus :) I'd also like to say thanks to Tyson and others for keeping tabs on this and offering technical insight. And once more, kudos also to us all for saving our money. Nevertheless, it will be interesting to see how this turns out in the end (although I'll be real amazed if they can produce an actual working pen - everything so far points otherwise). I hope we can keep staying in touch in here, even if its somewhat impractical forum for discussion. Renee, the information presented on the Mozbii campaign does appear quite plausible. The dimensions offered on the device are reasonable for the components that they claim are inside of it, and said components are what one would expect to be required for a device of this type. The functionality described is also in-line with the capabilities of the components themselves. As for whether the product is "legitimate" or whether the business, it's hard to say, however the CEO of the company is the former Operations Director for Apple's Asia presence for 5 years, and Sales GM for Pegatron and Quanta for 5 more, and then started his own companies roughly a years ago. Those are some reputable places and his histories with them is easily verified. At the same point, it's just not an "exciting" product. I know I speak for a lot of people when I say, a lot of us are disappointed at how big of a scam this became, but grateful our money wasn't stolen. An ink pen would have been nice, but there's at least some bit of hope for another color capturing stylus pen, and it's way more credible and transparent about production and product than the scribble ever was. My questions were actually answered in less than 24 hours! I know I posted it before, but for people who don't want to scroll down again, you really should check out the Mozbii. If you wanna back something that actually sounds legit, for at least a stylus pen, and actually explains things and even has prototypes being tested with a video of them actually testing it, go back this kickstarter up. I'd trust this one over scribble any day of the week. <url>"they work from home" and as an added bonus appear larger than I was at the time. Despite being a perfectly legitimate business with real products, sometimes you just need that extra let up to help get a level playing field and mark off that checkbox on the due diligence forms. If done correctly, they can create legitimacy if someone doesn't need to dig too deep, or if someone will only ever visit your actual Headquarters. It can however backfire extremely easily if done incorrectly, like a startup the size of Scribble, no history, 6 months away from release, needs a manufacturing presence, and in a building that leases it's space for $225 / foot / year! Dragonbait, as you've noticed, something just doesn't fit. If it was a "real" office, 100% of the money that they raise in their crowdfunding campaign will go entirely to their rent with nothing left over for those pesky things like salaries or manufacturing.

Would seem on odd building for a startup. The tennants include: Bank of America Barclays Capital Centerview Partners Cox, Castle & Nicholson Dodge & Cox Goldman Sachs Fenwick & West Jones Day Kirkland & Ellis KKR Financial McKinsey & Company Morgan Stanley Robert W. Baird & Co. Sandler O'Neill + Partners Sidley Austin LLP Shorenstein Company UBS AG Wells Fargo Advisors Must be atleast one backer in SF who can go look! 555 California Street, formerly Bank of America Center, is a 52-story 779 ft skyscraper in San Francisco, California. It is the second tallest building in the city, the largest by floor area, and a focal point of the Financial District. Anyone at SF willing to check out do they actually have offices in the said address? Cute email they sent out about stretch goals... I especially like how Windows stuff has been converted from "it'll be there to a stretch goal", despite still being talked about in their video dialogue. Pantone, certainly doable as it's just a comparison table... one that would need to be licensed, but doable. And then it gets down to the extra tips... Fountain, Felt and Brush... Um... These are *MASSIVE* engineering undertakings and on their own should be verifications that the product is a fake. How is one supposed to clean a felt nib to perform a color change? Secondly, let's talk about the differences in engineering between a ballpoint and a fountain pen... Yes, it *can* work for a few moments if appropriate pressure is provided, however a ballpoint pen works based off of maintaining pressure, usually in the form of a vacuum and then when the ball depresses forcing the ink out the sides and onto the nib. A fountain pen is quite different. It is gravity fed. If you have a pressure feed system there, ink will actually *squirt* out of the nib. Fountain and brush are for most intents and purposes equal in terms of operation as they'd relate to this project. I was holding out *some* hope before that I was wrong and that my fears were unfounded on this project... This "update" cements it... It's a fake. No doubt about it, there is zero way that this project is ever getting delivered as described. The only chance that they have is by scamming people out of a lot of money and having a "aw, shucks... we had a quality control issue come up in manufacturing and need to do some retooling. We'll update you as we know more" moment and bringing in someone who actually understands engineering to build it. Oh their new e-mail on stretch goals lists an address at least at the bottom. Says they're "Scribble" in 555 California street in SF. <url>"My Colours" section, the user swiped left to reveal menu buttons, and when the "x" was selected, the colour was deleted. However, when the same operation was performed in the second video [2], it suddenly goes to the device status page. The second video was so shit. It's like they wanted you to know it's fake. [1] <url>#t=81 [2] <url>#t=63 By the way, who loves the song? I really love it. Downloaded the MP3 and kept replaying it. Tell you what Scribble, I'll buy your theme tune for $0.99 on the iTunes store if you put it up there! @Dragonbait While the credit cards have been charged, based on the Tilt FAQ the Scribble pen people don't actually have the money. Luckily it seems that Tilt keeps it until the end of the campaign. "How does the money transfer to my account? Funds from successful campaigns are transferred directly to the bank account specified in your admin settings and will arrive in 1-2 business days following the expiration of your campaign." @Tyson regarding your maths exercise from earlier. I guess it's not surprising it doesn't add up. check the superstar $4000 level. they seem to think it is possible to hand out 20 of the first 10 pens. but they found a way to multiply their bank account so why not the first 10 items of the production line... everything they touch works because of magical elves and unicorns I wonder what the backers can do to get their money back if Tilt cancels the campaign. Great job guys. This reminds me too much of EmoPulse Smile Smartwatch. I really hope that they prove us all wrong but the evidence suggests otherwise. Great concept though. I hope they have inspired some folks or companies with the proper background to pursue this. Per a comment on the drop-kicker article (<url>#comment-5437), it looks like Tilt may be investigating the project now. I never checked. I was waiting for a real demo to decide on whether I was going to keep my early bird or not. Too many red flags in regards to this project. It seems to me that they are hiding too much. The old Facebook account that I saw linked was the ScribbleColor account, and not extremely helpful. Always possible that there was another one at some point and they replaced it with ScribbleColor though. There used to be a facebook account linked to this project. Unfortunately, they unlinked it. Jonah Grinage is an unusual enough name, but it too pulls up next to nothing relevant. No LinkedIn pages for anyone, *A* Facebook page for someone in Plano, TX which is probably unrelated. In public records, only 10 J Grinage-es that have lived in California, and none with a name with a common association with Johan, and no aliases. No listing for any of the three names on IEEE or associated mailing lists... If it is a legitimate business making a real product, I'd expect someone to have a paper trail and for people to have a reputation of some sort... On a cursory examination, they're invisible. @Tyson: the verified Kickstarter contact is Jonah Grinage. It's under the details section about the project. @Andy They released a press kit, launched a website, and started collecting email addresses for a newsletter well before their campaign launched on KS. I think it was back in late May. I have a question... How are there so many (seemingly legitimate) tech/news/etc articles on this? Granted, googling "scribble pen" now turns up a few articles that say possible scam. But way more articles written describing the pen, especially when the scribble pen first hit kickstarter. Someone has had to contact these news outlets,right? For this product to seem legitimate enough to have these in depth articles written about them? I guess I'm just naive. I was an early backer here, but no way am I touching it now. Interesting... A quick search on Kevin Harrison gives very little. LinkedIn gives no one by that name who would be vaguely associated with engineering... There is however an 8th Grade Math Teacher by that name. Considering the target audience and marketing push, it could mean something amidst the sea of everyone else is in Banking, Construction, Retail, or less relevant fields. No Facebook either from what I can tell, but with so little to go off of, how would you really now without something glaringly obvious like "I'm a color theory engineer whose been doing this full time for the past 2 years"? Always possible that it's been a part time thing and that he's had alternate employment in another field to pay the bills that wouldn't otherwise hit on the radar. Another name: Bahana Sakinah They Skyped with whomever was doing the video saying "Ah thanks. Is it only those 2 slides?" but that was obviously a display name in their contacts rather than that person's actual Skype name. Only one person pops up in a cursory search, and they're from Indonesia. Pretty opaque, and when no names are given, then how would you really know whether there is a valid history to the narrative being offered? However, the idea that this pen was inspired by Microsoft Paint should throw up a red flag or two... @Tyson Also notable, their domain name "getscribblepen.com" is a godaddy domain, run through "Domains by Proxy LLC" with a private registrant name. Without legal action can't really find anything out from that side. <url>"the San Francisco start-up that has been developing the device for the past two years with a team of electronic engineers and colour scientists." <url>"borrowed" technology rather than entirely home grown. Not it is someone else's complete product with their logo on the side as that would be quite easy to spot, but that it has bits and pieces from other products that got incorporated into their prototype without a proper understanding of how they work or importantly how they were manufactured. A variety of members of the public have seen and experienced said prototype and confirmed it's existence, yet there is a gigantic push to completely redesign every component before launch at "some unknown point in the future". The legitimacy concern with that project seems to be more on the histories of those involved: the company, it's past claims, and it's actual products; the idea of a company that subcontracts lightbulb manufacturing to others for specialized installations likely isn't going to have massive breakthroughs in acoustic technology. A company that goes to trade shows with claims to have working models of said acoustic technology available for years and "out on demos" or locked behind glass with the key lost or with someone else and described in white papers only, and will be available for sale "next year" for 3 years strait, likely is trying to pull something over on someone. Said information should have been investigated as well as the technical validation. The issue here with Scribble is that we have no names, no contact information, no actual valid company names anywhere in the United States... They're an unknown entity that appeared from nowhere and in turn with no history. They have also shown that they're faking everything that they can possibly fake for no good reason despite legitimate and frankly easier options being available. And they jumped ship for the one place where they will get funds deposited nightly from their "campaign"... At this point I'd say speculation is that one of the big reasons they left Kickstarter was so they could control the message more. They switched almost all of their communication to their facebook, where they could moderate and delete comments, are heavily deleting comments on their youtube video, and re-launched in a crowdfunding page of their own control without the options for comments. Kickstarter doesn't give them that sort of control over the comments. Guess they thought the added visibility that kickstarter gives wasn't worth having to deal with actual backers paying attention. @Dragonbait They've been deleting negative comments off of Facebook for the couple days I was watching the facebook now. They've also been deleting negative comments off of the youtube video. Guess maybe its time to start reporting them more actively. Looks like youtube has a report button for scams and fraud in their "spam or misleading" category. Oh and they have blocked me from commenting. Well thats the nail for me, I have absolutely no doubt its a scam now. Either my eyesight is going, or they deleted my Facebook comments suggesting people wait and buy at retail. What about the other video? He says, 'hello I'm Mark' without moving his lips!! Then definitely not in sync - mimed??!!! @Tyson: Wish we did this type of sleuthing for SoundlessBand. lol. At least we learned to be more critical. lol This is just getting embarrassing. No hands, no ink, the letters themselves were individually composited and they did multiple different versions at that just to screw with us! Next we'll find out that the lemon wasn't real either! I am sorry, I gave them way too much credit because I really wanted it to be true... It never crossed my mind that there would be this level of deceit in the project... I mean, I could understand it if they faked the color change and loaded a pre-mixed ink while they tried like hell to figure out the engineering behind making it work against an impossible deadline, but faking *EVERYTHING*??? Why? Hands exist... the vast majority of people on this planet have them. Pens exist. Normal, real, draws with regular ink for use on paper pens for that mater. Hands work great to hold them and manipulate them for writing and drawing! And yet you went for the absolute most difficult solution you could possibly ever do, ever by making an imaginary drawing with imaginary pens drawing with imaginary ink on imaginary paper with imaginary hands. At what point did that click as "this sounds like a damn fine idea!" Missed the "http" in the last comment, so here: <url>"scribble" (no pun intended), while the "3D" fill is identical in both. Also, look how comically small the start of the C is in the second frame compared to the first. <url>"Post Production" tweaks that went into the video. Apparently the hands weren't even real... I think they learned the wrong lessons from my video. It was supposed to be that "Post Production has gotten so easy that any schmuck can do it with zero training with an immediate turn around!", not that you should really go in and do things that would make George Lucas blush! even at the 37 second mark it clearly shows that they cut it to make it look like the ipad screen color changed - you can see the arm move positions but the camera stay stationary. This "project" getting funded really proves that theres a sucker born every second and I guess its immoral to sucker keep his money. @duncan, as a seasoned kickstarter backer I get frustrated when I see so many newbie backers just throwing their money at a campaign like they would if this was an actual product on Amazon. Even if this project is 'real' I would bet my house on it being massively delayed, or very different from what people are expecting it to be, or both. All we can do is be as vocal as possible about our concerns and hope that either people listen, or that we are wrong with our skepticism. @Dragonbait I don't know, its seemed yesterday that their enthusiasm was much greater than their common sense. For a while near the beginning of the releaunch, their new youtube video had half as many views as their Tilt had backers. On the plus side most of the backers hopefully came from the Kickstarter campaign so at least they had fair warning that this project is likely a scam. @tyson, likewise! I was an early bird backer for the ink pen originally. @Dragonbait, already have including the suggestion that they get in touch with Scribble and perform a quick, live, 5 minute Skype call to see the product in a fashion that is less susceptible to post production manipulations where Scribble can simply draw two colors from a single pen as they claim it is capable of doing and otherwise verify that it in fact exists. Maybe they'll look, maybe they won't. I'd like for the product to ultimately be proven legitimate and maybe it still will, however with each round of information that comes forward, the scales further tip in the opposite direction. And if anyone doubts that I've started my involvement in this project as a supporter, I invite you to read through the my early correspondence on this thread. Thankfully there aren't yet that many posts to wade through. I gave them the benefit of the doubt at first, but as time progressed and unavoidable evidence was presented from their own website which simply could not be reconciled with basic engineering, high school chemistry, let alone common sense, I was forced to reevaluate my own trust in the project that I came to realize came largely through the marketing push that it had received in advance of the campaign launch and my own desire to see it succeed. @tyson, <url>"team" had been accused of doing on multiple occasions. The sane number would be 120/3982 = 3.0% and 119/3982=2.9% as 3.01 has a deviation of 1 one hundredth from 3, while 2.98 has a deviation of 2 one hundredths from 3. One could also simply state that simply because 2.98 isn't yet 3, declaring it to be 3 is a fallacious statement despite it being "pretty close". It's the difference between bringing cookies to your class and having one kid get nothing because you forgot about him. Using "Sane" numbers here is intended to create a more readable narrative for those without a strong math background so that they could quickly understand the concepts that were being presented without their eyes glossing over, and why they should be weary about giving their money prematurely to something that has somehow found a way to get even more sketchy than it was when it was hosted here on Kickstarter the first time around. The fact of the matter is that many people are afraid of numbers and will stop reading when they encounter ones that are "too complicated" or concepts that they don't understand because they will feel threatened by those concepts. I'm not implying that all those that I am speaking to are incapable of understanding those concepts that I've outlined in my earlier write-up and those who do have a stronger engineering background, I'd be happy to have a more in-depth discussion regarding the product with you, but at the same point one must appeal to one's audience. Scribble defined that target audience through their marketing materials and as such it would be a mistake to target my information to electrical engineers and software architects in my explanations on why the product doesn't seem feasible. I personally find the possibility of a product like the Scribble pen quite intriguing, the concept itself extremely fascinating, and from an engineering standpoint there is no reason why it *couldn't* work if implemented in a sane and correct fashion. I have a number of ideas on how one could even do that, based entirely through the thought exercise of this Kickstarter existing and trying to figure out "how could this even work???" based on some of the claims offered by the Scribble team. @Tyson: You're going to use sane digits here but 3% is NOT 3% (but rather 2.988448016%) elsewhere? Why the change, Tyson? 1. Who are Scribble Technology? I didn't see any company pop up by that name using a few US Company Search sites. 2. Who are Mark and Robert? Surnames? What's their background? 3. Who in the company or group of people have the expertise in the printer miniaturization? What are their names and accomplishments? These are basic questions that I've asked myself for every project I've backed. So far, I have only one project out of over 30 that fooled me: <url>"sane" digit and taking some freedom in determining when that is appropriate for the purpose of readability and understandability for most audiences. The Pen's Dimensions are Height:162mm x Width:17mm The cartridge holds approx. 0.89 ml of ink per color, which means an entire set holds 0.89x5 ml Each scribble ink pen can produce between 7 and 9 kilometers of writing First, we'll assume that they meant mL instead of ml considering that a ml is one microliter (1/1000 of a mL, the unit by which ink is traditionally measured in a pen!) It's the difference between a fraction of a drop of each color ink and a sugar cube worth. 1 mL translates to 1 cubic centimeter (cc) of liquid. That liquid needs to go *into* some kind of canister that can go into the pen, which we have both been told and implied from imagery and the videos that these canisters are external to the housing and is supposed to "snap into place" for color changes. Taking the imagery provided on their page along with this FAQ Information, we now know that the "largest" width of the pen is 17mm and the height is 162mm. This scale holds true in their imagery providing the first true analysis of the external dimensions of the "product", making making the main body diameter 14.78mm which for ease of math we'll round to 15mm (which coincidentally matches with previous information they've told us). We subtract the nib height of 18.9mm (known from imagery) because they've told us that it is removable and is thus "unnecessary" for our calculations, and that gives us a working height of 143mm. That gives us a *total* of 25.1cc of total usable space within the pen. 17.7% of the pen is taken up simply with the ink cartridges themselves. That doesn't leave much space for the 15 hour battery, ARM9 CPU, scanning apparatus, the reservoir, circut boards, pumps, important things like the casing, or the like... All of these things add up and ultimately need to fit within that total volume. Let's just assume for a moment that their imagery is "on the level" and that the ink cartridges *only* start at the top of where they show, that they go 100% into the interior of the pen and that there is a 100% separation between the two with no form of structure connecting the two, and that the casing for the ink cartridges was the thickness of your typical freezer bag, as to ensure that as little space was wasted as possible in such a design. This would of course come with it a non-rigid side being a 4mil material, but being interior that would be of little consequence. In that case we are talking about the sides occupying 100micrometers, or a total cross section width of 1mm across all 5 cartridges, reducing the available area from 17.6cm^2 to 15.3cm^2 They show the height in their imagery as 18mm, making a usable volume of 2.754cm^3. 2.754 doesn't quite equal 0.89x5=4.45. It's one of those off by 40% numbers, meaning that even in a *BEST CASE* math where all circuitry is entirely wireless between the scanning apparatus in the head and the drawing apparatus in the body, we're still talking about ink cartridges that need to be 28.9mm to account for the ink, nearly twice as tall for the math to work out for how much ink is inside those cartridges. If one adds a 1mm pilon in the center as an internal structure and mechanism for power distribution and communication between halves, and a .25mm external casing (minimum possible for a rigid plastic, known from video interactions), that reduces viable volume to 17.59cm^3, but also increases the required space for ink to 36.2mm (25.3%) of the total volume of the pen. The obvious answer that Scribble will give here is "we made a typographical error on the amount of ink, and really meant to say .56*5 and were one line off on our number pad." At this point, everything matches with their imagery with a tiny interior lip that one would expect to find in any "insertable" cartridge. But at that point, the rest of their math breaks down too, math that I gave them on *MY* YouTube video on the conversion of microliters of ink to feet of coverage and pages of writing. So someone did donate $10000 to them. Apparently a credit card fraud :-) Duncan, are you kidding me? It never even crossed my mind that they would fake the whole drawing itself in post considering that that is an exceptionally asinine thing to do and creates massive complications and difficulties versus simply "driving to your local craft store, buying a tiny bit of ink in the colors you intend to use, and drawing on a *real* piece of paper with *real* ink." No wonder they needed a week to make the video, they decided to do things in After Effects that would make George Lucas blush. This also makes much more sense why items (including the paper, apple, lemon, cleaner, handbag, etc.) would move around the table so dramatically and reorganize themselves shot to shot despite the "paper" drawing showing what would logically be a linear course of events. I am sorry, I gave Scribble way too much credit in my earlier analysis. The good news is that the language offered on this project, namely "Pre-Order" versus "Gift" is actually extremely important and provides *MASSIVE* legal implications that can't be taken away, even though 854 people's money already has. (Tilt charges people's credit cards the moment the "Target" is reached.) With no comments there, people's only options are here, Facebook (which they will likely be highly curating or if they truly have zero intent upon delivering then simply deleting when all is said and done), or someone who sets up a new site for communication regarding this topic. And from the facebook, an interesting catch that seems to be the likely reason their first version of the video got deleted from youtube. <url>"They only used a single camera, which needed to move to focus on the content of the color changes, or general creative license in showing a dynamic scene." However, why then would there be call to have the paper move up to 8 inches left and right between each of those said shots, or items on the desk dramatically reorganizing themselves between shots? Possibility, that the lemon at 29s is a different lemon, however due to the blur it is difficult to say for sure versus simply being shown at a significantly different rotation relative to all previous shots (it is certainly a wildly different placement not observed in any previous or future shot). There isn't much call to take all the items off of a desk and put all new items back in a whole new order unless you are doing something "interesting". This whole thing seems very scammy. Whomever is backing on their Tilt site, I will personally place a bet that you'll never receive your Scribble Pen. If I am wrong, then congrats. Send me a pic of your working Scribble pen when you get it and I will personally give you free copies of any game or app I produce at Murmur for life. I am so certain that it will *NEVER* happen that there isn't a doubt in my mind that I'll ever have to deliver on this though, but if I do, then great... I'd love to be wrong and have the opportunity to purchase an actual, working Scribble pen, but at the same point there are so many things wrong with what they've described that it will either A: never work as they've claimed, or B: they have no intention of ever shipping. So, Scribble, please, prove me wrong... give me a reason to give you my money too. Convince me again that your cause is worthy of a financial contribution as you've previously done. It wouldn't be hard, I'd even sign an NDA regarding whatever you elect to show me, and you can sit me down for a Skype session to watch a "Multicolor Line Draw" session. When we're done, I simply say to the public "I am convinced that the product is legitimate." or "I do not have anything to discuss regarding the Scribble Product or it's developing company at this time." I'd even be happy to provide you with some gratis consulting assistance if it actually results in bringing your product to market where it would otherwise remain in limbo. Worth thinking about. But, I guess that when you have enough people who are giving you money even without an actual "vocal community", it doesn't really matter what this group thinks or says. Package I originally selected no longer available? Lame. Something seems fishy. I hope to see their shady actions questioned by some notable blogger or tech news site. Would be amusing. I'm speechless after seeing the "video". Editing and tricks. Lol. And that is supposed to convince us? I feel sad and sorry for those 566 backers they seem to have fooled so far. Hey guys...if you wanna back something that actually sounds legit for a stylus pen at least, and actually explains things and even has prototypes being tested with a video of them actually testing it, go back this kickstarter up. I'd trust this one over scribble any day of the week. <url>"special discount code which will allow you to reclaim your special Super Early Bird price". Which would have been really cool, except that when I signed up, I selected one of the regular price tiers because the Super Early Bird tiers had all sold out. Aside from everything else, getting an option to "reclaim" a price I never had is - well, I have a bad feeling about this. In the original video, the guy on the left just gave me a suspicious vibe in the way he read off his script...did anyone else get that same feeling? Thanks for providing us with a video that confirms this as a total scam. Amateurs...... If they really spend effort to prepare the video, showing a real working prototype then re-launch in KickStarter with new option of beta prototype (delivery within 1 or 2 months after project ending), this project can become another legend which can easily hit millions dollar of pledge within few days. The new video showing they are using the final product but the delivery still need to push until May 2015, a bit weird. I love how now you have conveniently moved it to another site where you supposedly save upwards of 10% in fees and now charge an additional fee for US shipping to your backers. If you're saving money, pass it on to your backers by either lowering the price or dropping the shipping charges. As everyone else has already said, this project just keeps getting more suspect. You should be making up for your ridiculous errors in some way. Instead you just march on as if nothing shady ever happened. Will NOT back this project, especially when they have full control over the fund. They don't have to respond to our question as well, and can just run away much easier without having to answer. The video is produced with BAD intention. It is heavily edited and totally shows that even the prototype is not working at the moment. Well add me to the list....I'm not going to touch this company...And I wanted to buy 2 of these! I feel so scammed. Oh well. I'll wait for it to go out. This is what happens when a Project Owner claims to be "production ready" and they are not. Check it out: <url>"really" do. The magic of video editing has clearly made this look like it's working. I'm too nervous to put money behind this anywhere besides Kickstarter. I'm impressed, there's literally nothing in the new video that couldn't be done manually based on when they cut. They never even show color matching to work for the stylus since they always cut between scanning the color and it showing up on the tablet, or between "scanning" and drawing. They could be switching ink cartridges and manually picking colors on the tablet for all the video actually shows. They obviously moved the campaign because they knew it was going to do really well and they didnt want to pay the 5% Kickstarter takes of the total funding. Yeah, no. Not buying it (even if I've supported other projects on Tilt in the past). No failsafe is a dealbreaker when there is so little trust. It boggles my mind why they did not launch a project for simply the stylus, which most at least believe them capable of building, then the Ink as a separate project later - if, and only if, they managed an actual prototype. Wont be using my "super early bird" code. Jeez.. they even cut between scanning and drawing. Between color changes, so they didn't have to cover however long it takes to clean is almost acceptable, but cutting between scanning and actually drawing with the color they just scanned is clearly misdirection... My guess is they ran that video past Kickstarter yesterday when they were originally supposed to re-launch, and Kickstarter told them it still wasn't good enough, so they switched to Tilt, resulting in the day and a half delay. Was originally in for $150 or so, definitely not re-backing on this random website without a comments section and an overly-produced new video. I was so excited about this. What a shame They moved the campaign because there isn't a failsafe on the other site. The new video is just as bad as the old one. It cuts away and is total and complete crap It was a really poor decision. Its too risky to back on a site with no failsafe. Was hopeful of a cool new piece of technology as an item like this has been talked about as a concept before seems like a scam now. They obviously moved the campaign because they knew it was going to do really well and they didnt want to pay the 5% Kickstarter takes of the total funding. If they were back on Kickstarter, I'd have backed and then waited till the end of the campaign to see if the internet hivemind really believed this was going to happen. Without that failsafe, I'll wait for it to hit retail (or not). I think them canceling this on kickstarter was a blessing in disguise. Moving somewhere else, faking their way through the video, no communication whatsoever. Screams of scam. I just got an email from them offering me a code to get my" super cheap" perk that I initially backed on here. No thanks. I'll keep my money for something less scamy. They did this so that trolls cannot question them. Bleh. This campaign on Kickstarter was waaay more exciting (and cheaper). Definitely not happy with this move. They obviously moved the campaign because they knew it was going to do really well and they didnt want to pay the 5% Kickstarter takes of the total funding. I'm not happy with pledging and leaving 159 dollars with my payment details on some unknown website... I'm interested why they moved too, considering how well the funding was going on KS. Either they new KS would cancel the campaign, or they wanted a platform where users can't ask questions that don't have legitimate answers, I can see no other possible reason! I'm floored. I'm at a loss for words... It is just too funny how this went down. They didn't need to fake it in post production or with sleight of hand since they were able to fake it with the sheer number of cuts in the video! And the fact that they've now pulled the video... There aren't words to describe this situation. And if this situation didn't feel scammy before, it sure does now!!! And the sanity checking on the video, here is how I would have done it: Load green ink into pen using piston converter. Assemble Pen. Start Filming. Draw using first ink. Stop Filming. Disassemble Pen. Clear green ink from pen using piston converter. Flush with water several times. Load yellow ink into pen using piston converter. Assemble Pen. Start Filming. Draw using second ink. Stop Filming. For what it's worth, I actually have fountain pens and piston converters, ballpoint and brush nibs that with can be operated in conjunction with a pre-filled piston converter, and multiple colors of ink that would allow me to duplicate the video (cuts and all) in minutes if I wanted to. Not that there's much point since the video has been pulled! I'd be a 3d printer and some paint away from getting a case for something like my Lamy Dialog 3 that would be "passable enough" for a video like this. Video is back up by the way,mcomplete wit a total lack of showing it actually working. All they had to do was not cut between drawing in green and drawing in yellow, but they couldn't even do that! Hmm, looks like Tilt handles funding quite a bit differently than Kickstarter. Looks like Tilt charges your credit card once they reach the funding goal, rather than charging them all at once when the time runs out. <url>"Private" to "Deleted by User" so sorry I can't be of any help. Also weird that they have different reward tiers on their website than they had here. Looks like they took down their video. Does anyone have any screenshots of what they changed? I missed it! Ouch... Nevermind... Really bad move on their part... Ya looks like they're using Tilt Open: Crowdfunding <url>"customers" and that is not ok. Nearly 2000 backers to this project and being unable to keep open communication with us is not acceptable. As much as I was looking forward to this project I will keep my money at this time. Should this project be funded and moved to general sales then MAYBE and that's a big MAYBE I will consider buying it. It's truly sad as I was really looking forward to having a tool like this. Especially the ink pen. What an amazing thing that would have been. It's too bad that a company that could have had so much potential has shown nothing but blatant incompetence. If today passes without launching, it'll be beyond humorous. It would be near impossible to find anyone else so dedicated to repeating their mistakes! Though, the same would be said for those of us who continue to believe them... @duncan lol :), don't give them possible excuses to use! Well a day on Venus lasts 243 Earth days. Maybe they've relocated there. Hmm so there latest answer to a time from just 1 minute ago: "We're definitely launching today. Sorry for the wait !" That's really the bottom line. Honesty is extremely important, and yet more often than not Kickstarter has turned into a platform of open deception. Q: "Do you have a finished product that is ready to ship?" A: "Yes." No ambiguity, no questions about it, the product exists, is done, works, and is ready to go. Followed by "oh crap, turns out that customs stole it, or our manufacturing partner screwed us, or in final validation we realized some major design flaw and need to go back to pre-prototype stage with an entirely new design to correct. More often than not, even a "real" project that actually does ship is met with lies. Take the Veronica Mars movie. Paid for by this backing community... But also paid for by Warner Bros, and by more product placement than your typical television advertisement. From what I have seen, most Kickstarter campaigns are a lie, a money grab from whomever will give it. There is the oddball case where it is actually, really real but more often than not a crowdfunding campaign is fraught with problem after problem and trouble upon trouble. It's certainly beneficial for the company because they get money from "not-investors" who don't get a debt or equity stake in the company based on the simple promise of "if this is ever produced, than they get one. If it's not, then sucks to be them!" It generates cashflow, shows interest, and can help to get an actual investor in the door and show that there is real interest in the product and what said value can be. Even here, $366,566 in 48 hours for what is essentially a pen (a cool pen, but a pen) is worth considering an engineering project by a reputable company, and this number can show legitimacy to the market size even if this campaign does ultimately prove to be a scam. @Richard If Scribble had just been honest from the beginning and stated that they did NOT have a working prototype and are working towards that goal I would have been fine donating money. I did donate initially because I had faith in this project. They seemed to have taken their time to prepare. I was even willing to give them a second chance after they pulled the project. I was willing to reserve judgement until I saw the pen in action and then a S**t storm of events took place. No answers, timelines set and missed, they pulled their website. All of these things made me lose faith in this company completely. At this point with no communication from Scribble it has made me lose my trust in them. And what sucks the most is all they had to do was be honest from the get go and just say "We need funding to create a working prototype" and I would have still considered backing. But now I cannot under good faith give them any of my money. Which is sad. What makes this most painful - although I admit that at this point its moved towards farcical - is that all of these were unforced errors. 1) The original campaign was launched on their schedule. 2) As far as I can tell it was pulled by them as well (I've talked to several other Kickstarter creators who didn't have KS asking for more information, but who knows at this point when you can't trust the only people (rarely) talking to level with you). 3) After canceling, the "video release" timeframe was set (and missed) only by Scribble 3) The next "relaunch" date of 8/28 was set (and missed) by Scribble 4) The "two hours" timeframe was set (and missed). The only thing that the official Scribble account has ever said is needed but missing is a video of their prototype. On the Kickstarter page, they claim to have a fully functioning prototype. The lesson to learn here as a creator is that if you're not even close to ready to go, don't launch. The lesson to learn as a backer is left as an exercise to the reader. Well, the two hours passed... not sure why there needs to be so many delays... On facebook they now say they will be relaunching "within two hours" as of around an hour ago. We'll see what exactly that means if/when they actually do. I've questioned, via Facebook, whether the re-launched campaign is still in KS. However like my most of my questions I expect it will go unanswered! @richard, yes very odd, if they are doing that to sidestep Kickstarter because KS are insisting they show a video of a working device, then it is definitely a scam and I would seriously advise people to steer well clear! According to one sharp eyed watcher who posted to their facebook page, they're spinning up their own funding portal on their website which is why it was down yesterday: <url>"this is why 95% of projects *should* be vetted". All of these situations that just don't add up with weeks of effort to get ducks in a row and can't pull it off to simply make a "not marketing video" showing your prototype, warts and all, combined with a "We're launching at: 08:00 am EST/ 13:00 GMT. Hope that helps". Then when it's no longer 8:00am anywhere on planet earth, $#@!, pull the website!!! No answers, just go silent. That screams something to me at least, and it isn't "We're super badasses who are masters of the uncertain universe!" As for what, I'll leave that for you to figure out. So now that they say on FB it is "delayed" what does that mean? Are we talking hours? days? weeks? They just say they'll "let us know". @jennifer The website was up this morning, suggesting it is down for changes RE the re-launch. Until we see some video of the working prototype switching colours I would still urge caution. They just posted on FB that it's a delay...but no word as to when relaunch is. If this pen exists, then why all the delays and cancelling?? I'm really starting to doubt the relaunch. It's now many hours late, and their website is no longer available... YET, a small part of me still hopes this is just a delay, since I'd really like to have the pen! :S have they given any indication of what time they are re-launching? Their website "getscribblepen.com" is currently "under maintenance" Wonder if Kickstarter requested a "Show us live, via Skype, real time that this really exists before we let you launch the campaign." @richard And they need to be accurate and honest with their descriptions. Claiming 'millions of colours' everywhere, but keeping quiet about the sensor only detecting 65,000 colours is misleading, even Mozbii clearly state on the front page it can detect 65k colours with a 16bit sensor. @Richard, we can only hope Scribble have learnt there lesson from the first attempt and make a project page more like Mozbii. They need to show actual prototypes (not just renders) and they need to show the pen changing inks in the video, otherwise the same thing is going to happen again. @Richard I'm impressed, that mozbii thing seems to straightforward and actually relatively accurate in how it is described. Its obviously going for a very different audience than the Scribble is aiming for, but they have prototypes everywhere in that video, talk about where their sensor's color accuracy is now, and working on improving it, and they even say that its 16-bit sensor can detect 16-bits of color! I'd say ya, that looks like some good communication there. <url>"new video" shooting an item that your page claims already exists and was due to be released earlier this week....? @Emma Nieradka No. This campaign was cancelled, so the pre-authorization hold on your card was also cancelled. If you wish to continue backing this project, when it re-launches you will need to re-back it and put a new hold on your card, which will then charge whenever the new campaign clears. now that you are back on track with your launch does that mean that our cards will still be charged on the 15th? Will you set a reward level with both the pen and stylus at your relaunch? I stand by my previous statement too. Show us a video that you shoot in 2 minutes - one take with a celphone is fine - and put up on YouTube. That would have saved you $350K and kept the kickstarter alive. Are you unwilling to do that or unable to? The longer the delay the more I assume it's the latter. I'm here because I wanted to give you money too... @Scribble Tyson summed it up very well, we are here because we want this device. But you need to tell us more about it and show it working. We understand it's not a finished product yet (if it was you wouldn't be on kickstarter) but we need to see what it is you do have so that we can evaluate whether it is worth our donation. When we donate on Kickstarter it is a risk, and we need to be able to differentiate between a great idea, and a great idea that is actually achievable. @Scribble I can only speak for myself, but I personally want to believe you and assume that the vast majority of people here do too. We wouldn't be here trying to give you money if we didn't. But at the same point, there are a number of details that simply don't add up that make things shift more on the scale from believable to unbelievable, and we'd like your help to shift things back into the believable territory. You chiming in and describing the battery is the first step towards that path. Another would be when you tell us how much ink the pen has. Or the interior dimensions of the mixing chamber and it's distance to the nib so that we can know how much ink is wasted following a color change. These details would help to validate the claims that you have made regarding your technology, all the while would in no way disclose "the secret sauce" to enable someone else to duplicate what you've done. Beyond these details, I'd also recommend that rather than going with a professionally produced video, perhaps choose 1-2 members of the community who would be willing to sign Non-Disclosure Agreements or something similar and let them visit your facility or participate in a Skype call in which they can observe a live demo and vouch to the remaining backers that the prototype exists and functions as shown in the video that you will be posting in a week or so. These details will help everyone involved to really believe in you, cast aside all doubts from the beginning, and probably even get them to spread the word and grow the size of the campaign larger than it was this time around. Just a thought. I might be completely off-base, and you don't need to take my advice or anything. I'm just one of the 1959 people who wanted to give you some of my hard earned money on the hope that your product was for real. for help making a great video check out Wistia.com Nothing on their Facebook page in the last 14 hours and everything except the splash screen on their website still points to this kickstarter. I think they've disappeared. @Tyson - You sound like the person to create a working version of this technology. The money and interest are obviously out there and you have appropriate knowledge. Maybe you should be the one to consider taking this forward? @Scribble Technology - Since you already have a working prototype, I would suggest getting a booth somewhere and have random people try it out and videotape their expressions, reactions, and comments. - I just read through a lot of the earlier comments and those folks are correct. Your current video barely shows the product in action. - I do not doubt that KS sent you a video request because a few of your more vigilant and experienced backers, who have had the unfortunate experience of being scammed on KS, reported the project as being suspicious. @Justin Should Scribble create a video to Kickstarter's specifications (considering that Kickstarter doesn't have specifications for videos, or even require them, that is quite a head scratcher...) then they are free to re-post the campaign and then we are free to re-back it if we so choose. Considering that they collected our email addresses before the campaign as well as can still send updates now that the campaign has ended, they can still alert us to the fact that the new campaign has started and allow us to back it. Those who had early birds, yeah, that sucks considering that those are gone... New people will get a chance to pick them up. However unless there is something truly magical shown in the video that is posted, the concerns about feasibility and whether it is really "real" instead of post production magic that is made possible due to the extra week of time is anyone's guess. Still, it says a lot that they were prepared to throw away $366,566 over *not* posting a video that should fully be in their capacity to either really make (or effectively fake well within their 24 hour period that they were given) since it takes minutes to do, assuming of course that Kickstarter even gave that ultimatum. I went at the start from being massively behind them to a fairly strong contrarian based on the evidence that I've seen, but I'd really like to believe that the product is real and that they've been able to make it work. The technology to do it is there and just needs to be put together in the right fashion to make it happen. But at the same point that isn't going to be happening by someone who doesn't know that there's a real difference between how a dye and pigment works beyond their water and light fade resistance. @Justin, I think the implication is that once they have made the video Kickstarter requested they'll re-post the project as a new Kickstarter, probably post an update here linking to the new one and try to start over. The pledges from this one have all been cancelled and you will have to re-pledge on the new one if you decide you still want to. So, for those of us who made a pledge, are we just left out in the cold, or what? @Dropkicker To true, the hand did leave the frame, however you can clearly see in the reflection of the cup that the hand remains fully clenched the whole time. Forgive me, I'll do better next time. Still, congrats at finding a great *low tech* solution to the problem that would have faked the video very clearly with a little bit of sleight of hand. A little less "holy crap, look, the tip of the pen just faded from blue to yellow before my very eyes showing it 'mixing' the colors in it's reservoir in the 2-5 seconds and then being ready to write in that color (just as Scribble described!) in a fashion that seems convincing enough if you don't put too much thought into it and now the pen too is drawing yellow!!! It even left a little blue on the paper, so it must have still had a little left in the tip that hadn't fully flushed out, so it must be true!!!" So yeah, I put a little bit of thought into that video to match what they described no matter how far fetched it may "really" seem at the expense of reducing the "quality" of the effects. Oh, and I'm not a video or a marketing guy... Just an engineer. I am certain that someone who really knew and used the tools on a regular basis could have done a much better job in the same time as well. Oh, and in Risks and Challenges they did say, "The greatest challenge we now face, is taking this project from a working prototype into mass production." Thus implying the existence of said working prototype - which means that producing that quick video /should/ be simple. Le sigh. I had previously figured that the long delay between announcement and Kickstarter was actually a good sign that things were proceeding conservatively, too. @Tyson I'm calling bullshit. You switched the pen out when your hand left the frame! ;) @Richard Stanford You couldn't have said it better. And considering that I've now just shown them how to make such a quickly done, single cell phone camera fake the video in a timely fashion... um... At least now everyone here knows what to be on the look out for! You're welcome? I guess that now I have the unofficial job of "if the project ever does start up again and I'm not 100% convinced that it is completely real, I'll be 'debunking' their videos by re-creating them with my Sharpie Mini." @Creator: One decent celphone, one prototype, one sheet of paper, three scannable things, 2 minutes, one YouTube video, and you'd have a lot of happy people ready to back your next launch. Failing to do that, and I'm afraid that you're basically saying that it can't be done without post-production. Agreed. I was in at the super-early-bird level for the INK, but I'm going to take this as a lesson learned and pass on the next one (if there even is a next one). The explanation given as to what Kickstarter asked for is quite ridiculous, since a detailed low-quality video could be produced quite easily in a couple of hours especially if it meant keeping the $366K of pledged money. To rejoin a new scribble project I'd like to see an actual explanation *from Kickstarter* as to what happened here. Failing that, I'm out until I can just order one from Amazon. Great job all on sniffing out a potential scam. Will they hire David Blaine for their next video? I'll change my backing to back Tyson instead! Not cool what's happening !!! grrr... What do you mean ? You abandon this project ? Oh, no ! I don't know what to think about this... Why (?_?) Marie (from France) I've just spent the past 5 minutes making a comically bad video of my pen "scanning" a color as Scribble described to us in how it works, drawing one, scanning another, drawing it, doing an intentionally bad job of color correcting it and uploading it to youtube and being ready to watch... So, if I can do that in 5 minutes, imagine what someone could do with a full day if they wanted to... <url>"request[ed] a new video within 24 hours" seems quite unbelievable. I suspect Scribble used KS's request to seize an opportunity to relaunch the project (supposedly next week when the video is ready) with a much higher funding goal and pledge prices. This had better be one heck of a detailed video, because I'm going to think twice before backing this project again. @Dropkicker That isn't necessarily true, on a ballpoint just above the ball in a micro reservoir with a continuous pressure feed of each color, it would be *possible* to provide each color in a changing way. Maintaining pressure as each type of ink depletes at varying levels in a non-vacuum sealed, end-user refillable / replaceable fashion would make for an engineering nightmare, but it would be "possible". Felt would certainly be quite problematic as it would be extremely difficult to *clean* the felt between color changes. This introduces a number of challenges that don't exist in a conventional inkjet printer, but the concepts are *similar* and are not insurmountable. Until I saw that there was an ink mixing reservoir of the size that you could drown a small dog, I was of the perspective that they were working on a viable implementation. Since seeing their diagrams, I've since re-evaluated my opinion... The "other" concerns came later and just cemented the belief that they may be using Kickstarter simply as a source of R&D Funding and shortly after funding closed *would have* closed it would have been a "whoopsie, there was an 'unforeseen' manufacturing issue, and we've since needed to re-tool, and we'll get back to you when we know more." Should the project re-open in a week's time, that's a very real possibility. After all, a week is a long time to make a video showing someone drawing two colored lines, and color correction has been around for a really, really long time and is free with most video editing packages any more. my gues would be that they were told by KS that they had to show their prototype (as per KS rules) and the protype, if it exists, is not as far along as they intimated (it probably isnt even a pen, its probably a big black box full of breadboards and electronic) hence they cant make a video in 24 hours. Ty to bgfilly for informative comments and insight, and to Dropkicker for reminding me that this project talked about mixing inks before applying them to paper through a nib and not delivering them in the respective quantities through separate channels to be mixed as they flowed onto the page. If the creators had been up front and said they wanted to raise money to get to a working prototype instead of implying they were poised to go into production then maybe we'd all have been happier. It won't stop me backing other interesting projects but it has certainly left me with a very poor impression of the people behind this one. Baffled and disappointed by the sudden cancellation of the project without any explanation particularly when it has been doing so well. I am hoping for a reasonable explanation necessitating this drastic action. @Richard Baylis- There was another project just like this called the Color Picker Pen that tried but could not seem to get it operating and functional. Not to say Scribble hasn't done as much but it's very hard to duplicate color on a computer. As a photographer/artist I know this first had. It never prints correctly even using the best inks out there. So that may be the case here. I think they may have some knowledge of what to do but not a fully working prototype. If they had a full working prototype as you and others have mentioned it would not have taken more than 24 hours to come up with a video showing the pen as operational and functional. I will reserve full judgement when the project is relaunched and as excited as I was I am absolutely skeptical now given their lack of responses and someone vague explanation. Something smells fishy here, and it's not the trout on my head. @Richard Inkjet printers don't mix ink in a pen, they mix it *on the page*. This allows them to change colors quickly as there is no mixed ink that needs to be removed or cleaned. This cannot work with a ballpoint or felt-tip. I think I broke it. @Conscious Consumer So? Do you think that I'm disappointed about calling them on the distinction between dyes vs pigments, or the size of their mixing chamber and how much ink it *really* takes to write something, how much ink the pen even holds, or calling for info on the battery capacity or ARM SoC Generation to determine likely battery life ranges for in-use versus standby, or the differences between a 16-bit and 24-bit number, or that there are in fact *NO* 16-bit RGBC sensors on the market? Those are quite legitimate questions that were unanswered and were either used ambiguously or incorrectly, in turn causing red flags for me. I'd personally like to see this project succeed (well, I guess it's already been cancelled, so one like it in the future), but at the same point I feel that those engineering said project need to be able to address should the project ever move from idea to product. @bgflly - Maybe I'm too trusting but inkjet printers have been blending three or more colour inks for years and building the tech into a pen seemed feasible. The deadline was still far enough away for the proof to be provided so I'm surprised Kickstarter would insist on a 24 hour deadline. Besides, as Duncan noted, that's still plenty of time to film and post a simple video proving the product was viable. Seems to me that either a) it is vapourware b) it was a scam all the time or c) they got greedy and realised with that level of support they could charge a lot more for the product. I'll happily apologise if all of the above turn out to be false and the product and their intentions are genuine, but right now something smells really bad about this. This isn't the way Kickstarter creators treat their backers. Update #2, which was sent out early this morning, said a new video would be out within a week. If Kickstarter told them they needed it within 24 hours in a letter dated 8/12/14, then it doesn't make sense for them to have written that dated 8/13/14. This is very disappointing and feels false. @ally McGill- Judging from the email they sent about the cancellation they intend to relaunch within a week or so after they make their new video. Which tells me that we will have to reback. And give that I was put on a mailing list and emailed hours after the launch when I was suppose to be notified ahead of time. I have a feeling I will be missing out on any early birds AGAIN. I don't understand what's going on with the cancellation... All this for a video??? The email I was sent said funding was cancelled so you will no longer be charged... Does this mean I'm SOL for a pen?? All that was really needed was a simple cut-less un-edited video of someone sitting down with the pen that could have been done from start to finish in approximately an hour. Hell there's plenty of artists who live-stream themselves drawing. It hardly takes a week unless you're going through a full process to make a marketing ad rather than a demonstration video. @richard Baylis- It makes perfect sense. If people were demanding that they prove the project work my bet would be that people who were skeptical reported the project and kickstarter stepped in and demanded they prove their project work. @finadan i agree with you also Don't believe a word of the poor excuse just sent by email. I doubt Kickstarter would insist on a new video being posted within 24 hours, especially as it was the project owner's decision to make a new video. This doesn't make any sense at all. I'll believe it when I see it. Could have thrown up a quick cheap video while they work on the higher quality one. I've heard the promises of the future from other KS projects (luci), but they were nothing in the end. If this comes back with any different pledge options, I'll be even more skeptical. I also think the possibility of a video holding people over that is faked to grab some money will be on everyone's minds now with the lack of responses to all of the tech questions, but responses to others. Hmmmm Interesting that they were contacted by kickstarter to put up a new video. As an artist having a pen like this would be amazing. But given the inconsistencies I'm not sure I wanna reback...I will reserve my judgement after I see the new video. @Michael Simmons Definitely. I'm also curious why Kickstarter would demand a video in 24 hours. That doesn't make any sense at all. WTF Scribble?! You received over 3x your target funding and then cancel the project on Day 2 of the KickStarter campaign? I can't imagine any excuse that would satisfy your 1,959 disappointed backers. It's not exactly like it takes more than 24 hours to pull out someone's phone, grab the already existing prototype, scan something, draw a line in one color, scan something else, draw another line in a different color, the end. No cuts, edits, no fancy camera tricks... A week+ usually means fancy camera tricks and the potential of being misled. And since Kickstarter themselves were asking, it's obviously the case of "please prove that you're real not a please make a big budget marketing video, you don't need to show it to everyone, just to us to say you're real and we let you stay while you figure the rest out." I can understand the reasoning at least. Shooting a professional video answering everyone's questions would surely have been more than a 24hr project. However I think the explanation update should have come before canceling the project, not over an hour after. @Tyson I think they got what they wanted from this campaign, especially from you. You single handedly have them free r&d service for the development of their product. And the rest of us gave them a good idea as to how their product would be received via sales volume. They didn't even think about posting their precious technology. And put some mocks up so they could get all the free feedback. Smart company. Does their "explanation" leave any more of you with doubts? New message says they are relunching soon with a new video. I wanna see the INK work. The first day, they ignored all technical questions. The second day, they ignored all questions; in fact not communicating at all. The third day, they signed in, thanked everyone, answered *a* low hanging fruit technical question about battery capacity from the biggest "technical question" stickler (with specs that happen to be identical to the TenOne Pogo Connect, but I'd expect something *similar* considering that both are Bluetooth connected Styli. Sure, they'd only know that from either tearing down said pen, or buying / speccing out a similar part), followed shortly afterwards by canceling the whole campaign. Add to that all the other weird things that have come up over the campaign, and it leads to a whole lot of "was this really a scam and they thought the better of it?" No info from them on the cancellation, and it sure feel like it. There are a number of possible reasons why this has happened, but it's not likely to be a hoax. When someone cancels a KS campaign, all pledges are cancelled and backers are not charged. It would take a remarkably incompetent fraudster to have all this funding at their fingertips just to give it back. As such, I agree with the others who have theorized that a VC has stepped in to offer millions in funding. The one thing that suggests that this theory might not be true, however, is that the last message from the creators says the following: "In view of the many requests to better see and understand how the Scribble Pen and Scribble Stylus works, we are currently shooting another video in more depth which will be available within the next week or so." It could be that they thought having a more illustrative video would draw even more funding and they could set a higher goal. Regardless, this is a poor way to deal with backers who have pledged to help make your dream a reality. @tylerregas Haha lmao � @Frederic tarabout do you think it worked lol Whatever the reason, the silence doesn't build consumer confidence. No, we aren't owed anything here - but it would be nice to know what transpired... especially since they promised transparency. Yeah. That's the most likely reason @Mohammed Tanveer. Fairly sure this is a KS screw-up. getscribblepen.com is alive and well and the buy now link points here. If they were pulling the plug, wouldn't you think they'd pull that site down too? Giving them the benefit of the doubt, it may be cancelled because of patent infringement, as apparently there were similar patents out there (although no similar projects). My gut feeling says it really wasn't feasible, though, and I'm glad it was cancelled before anyone was hurt financially. I will admit I'm not surprised. I am disappointed, though, as this would have been awesome had it been possible. :) My best guess so far is: " Hey look, there's a cancel button! Lol, wonder if it really works ?" I think a bigger company has bought there project and made them millionaires This project was canceled over an hour ago and there has still yet to be an explanation as to why. I waited months for this and was super excited when I was able to back it. But now even if it is relaunched I may rethink that. To cancel a project without explanation or notice is unprofessional. It's been more than an hour. That's enough time to write a reasonable explanation as to what happened. I'm feeling like many other people on here, why cancel? Why the conflict in messaging? As a graphic designer and someone who enjoys art in general the concept in this product is something I was very excited about. If another company can produce the same product for close to the same price I will purchase it. Just very disappointed it won't be from Scribble. Ruh-roh. This isn't good. @Robert: Hah. Apparently that was a lie. From Risks and Challenges: "From the start of our campaign through to the delivery, we intend to keep you fully updated on all the stages of our progress. We will keep you fully informed regarding details of unexpected issues or delays, if any, and we promise to be fully transparent on all aspects of the project at all times." Pro tip: when you cancel a campaign that has no apparent reason for being cancelled, you should have a reason ready to go or even posted before cancelling it. WTF Seriously, they probably just realized how much money they could make. Quadrupling their goal in a day? This is a multi-million dollar business opportunity for a real VC. I just want my pen! On a positive note. If they found the project was not feasible, or if indeed it was a hoax from the beginning, at least they cancelled now and didn't string everyone along for a year or more, then disappear, taking the money with them. Yes, I'm talking to you ZionEyes. One founder is a sober, logical fellow. The other is a crazy, binge-drinking, meth addict. Guess which one started this Kickstarter and which one cancelled it when he found out. Now, I'm not saying this is true, I'm just throwing it out there. #foxnewsjournalismtricks What is tad bit curious is that after a bit of googling, all I can find about the company in question is this: "About Scribble Technologies Inc.- Scribble is the leading end-to-end content engagement platform that enables brands, sports organizations and media companies to drive engagement on their digital assets resulting in improved retention and acquisition of customers." Trademark conflicts? A hoax altogether? Would be nice for creator to appear and clarify things. As someone who works with color every day and struggles to get colors correct on a daily basis, I thought this sounded too good to be true. If color reproduction in CMYK based on a scan were as easy as they were making it out to be, I wouldn't need an every expanding library of color swatches like this one: <url>"prove that your product can actually work, and that you aren't simply taking this money to fund R&D to make it work, or worse that this wasn't *just* a rendering based off of an HP patent that they saw from 2002 that looked pretty cool. I am as confused as the rest and would appreciate an explanation from the creator - I was very excited about backing this project and hope to be able to continue my support, even if it needs to morph into something else that is still appealing to me. Canceled without a reason? I will not fund this project ever again. @Duncan, You are absolutely right. All very likely. Also a forth possible outcome is that they felt they were not dependent on the backers to get this product going. (may have partnerships starting), and may need time to prepare new business ties in order to bring a strong product to the consumers. Canceling without a heads up or explanation doesn't really strenghen my trust in your business and product, I'm sorry. Let's hope you had a really good reason and manage to make up for the communication disaster. Thinking of raising the pledge categories? You can bet we will not be as happy to pledge a second time if there isn't a good explanation. I hope this is a mistake. I'm glad this happened and it's not at all a surprise to me. Sorry. Just wanted to be different than everyone else here. few options: 1) it was a joke - the scribble pen is just not technically feasible and they would like to see how much to earn with nothing 2) they consider increase the price due to the USD pledged in one day 3) they realize that funds will not be enough to finalize the project ... AND WITH NO EXPLANATION Whatever the option, I will further think before being again a backer of this project !!! It is just not professional for a project on which they apparently have been working for 2 years Words cannot adequately describe how disappointed I am in this sudden cancellation. I've backed other projects on Kickstarter, two of which have had major delays and have yet to deliver, but they at least were honest and communicated with their backers. If the project was never viable then the creators should be ashamed at messing us about, and if they cancelled for any other reason but intended to re-launch later then they have hacked a lot of genuine backers off and may not get their support again. I hope an update gets posted soon to explain their actions. We deserve nothing less. I absolutely agree, please give your backers a reasonable explanation. I very much like this idea and pledged, to get a pen for someone special to me that would LOVE it. Hoping that this will still be a product in the future! What in the world? Something doesn't smell right to me... ???????? Took me so hard to get a super early bird, and then this happened. feeling lost!! @Jonathan I see it could probably be one of three things, in order from best to worst Best case: accidental cancel Neutral case: Some unforeseen circumstance made continuing the kickstarter in its current form impossible Worst case: They didn't actually have a functioning prototype that could do what they said it could. Meteoric rise - Meteoric fall? What the heck! I've waited for ages for this and you almost quadrupled your goal. What is happening? I'm not understanding this at all. This morning we get an email saying thanks for your support and to keep sharing the project. And then suddenly it is canceled without warning and without any explanation...Please give us an update! Please tell us this was an accident. This is weird. Hoping for an explanation... Why suddenly cancel after sending out a "Thanks to all our supporters" update? Not cool. @Alex Bannister The Creator decided to cancel this project. No money should be charged from your creditcard. I am with Laurence Freedman. I only pledged for the stylus. I'm with everyone else, why on earth was this cancelled??? If you're going to cancel something, at least give everyone an explanation at the same time!! OK...why was this canceled? First email today states you guys were working on a more detailed video to answer all questions, then now we get a canceled email. Explanation would be great in case you guys come back with the product later. :( What? Are you kidding? I'm with Laurence here. Personally, if they relaunch but can only offer the stylus I'd be interested. What just happened? Just got an update and then canceled? Why was it cancelled? Whaaat??!! It had to be a hoax. Why cancel? Ink bit did sound a bit too amazing to be true. I'm curious to hear the explanation for canceling. Why was this canceled? Well, the cancel email definitely made me sad. Update please Yeah, what's going on? Well this seems to be a rather unexpected development. What is going on? Why? Wut??! What happened??? Does that mean funding has stopped or the project? Why has this been canceled?? Cancelled? What happened @creator? What just happened?! Canceled? What? @Angela Hair They say $3 - 10 (not specified, but implication is single color) on their website and $15 - $30 (set) here, so, quite a range. We have however been told that one can change a single color individually. We haven't yet been told how many ml of ink we get of each color for those costs, or how much waste there is when changing colors, however from earlier marketing materials that have been uncovered, it appears that there is a massive reservoir for mixing, so it "may" be substantial... We don't know... @Alex, I agree. I am at $1 because I am really interested in seeing where this goes, if it really is true. I believe the stylus for electronic drawing is absolutely possible, given the proper software, as that would make the stylus pen basically a physical "eyedropper" tool. Sure, there may be some changes to the recorded color based upon lighting (our eyes are very good at playing tricks with shadows), but overall it's do-able. But as an actual pen with actual ink? IF technology has reached this point yet, it's got to be insanely expensive to get refills! White ink and metallic ink would be awesome as well. I know these are possible, but probably very difficult to manage. Just wondering, will the scribble be able to produce fluorescent colours? I'm unfamiliar with ink technology, so I have no idea if this is possible or not, but it would be awesome if it is :) @Justin, like most things with this project nobody knows. I would say the battery cant be very big: Li-ion has a Maximum energy density of 265 Wh/KG=71621mAh/KG= 71.6mAh/gram The pen including all it's internals only weighs 39 grams. @Pauline. Mini Audio is suspended as it is a rebranded product or it can be find in Alibaba or others. @Fellow backers. Let's give the creator the benefit of doubt. Perhaps they are busy creating the video or preparing answer to the technical question. I have been tracking this project for 18 months basically since you started and while I am not withdrawing my pledge at this time, not having a full demo up is a major red flag. You would ease a lot of complaints by doing that the fact that it may be 66000 colors instead of 16 doesn't bother me but you guys need to be honest because no one wants to be played here. I also have very many questions. In addition to those below an explanation of how one manages the colour store would be helpful. If I have 64K colours stored how do I find the one I want? To the creator I would say - all backers want this to work and be successful, but you must be open and honest about workability and problems - your backers may have the answer! I notice that someone questioned whether Kickstarter still reviewed projects. They will if a project is reported - they suspended ' Mini Audio' only last week for investigation. A project can be reported if you think it is not meeting Kickstarter rules, (claiming to have made something when you haven't, presenting someone else's work as your own, or misrepresenting or failing to disclose relevant facts). Suggest we wait for detailed answer and update but if this is not forthcoming then report to Kickstarter. What is the battery life of the pen? The obvious answer is that being able to re-calibrate one's own pen would enable a lot of interesting things including accounting for wander from the pen's image sensor, adjusting the mixtures of a particular ink to better meet some particular use case (like writing on a special purpose paper), or even possibly using different types of ink than those made available through Scribble. These are simply speculation on my part as an engineer as what one could do with deep access into the pen's firmware and is based on nothing beyond my own intuition. This should not be construed as "the answer" for why one would choose the developer pen over a stock pen and should really wait until we hear back from Scribble. Personally, I have my doubts about the feasibility of the project, the least of which is their insistence on using dyes versus pigments, yet claiming pigment properties for their product. What is the different between Hacker Edition Scribble Ink with normal Scribble Ink? What is the purpose of re-calibratable? @Creator: You mentioned "Most of your questions were addressed on our blog several weeks ago." However, the last blog entry I see on your website is from June 10th. Is there another blog you speak of? In that blog, you link to your Youtube page where you say you have upcoming videos of the pen in action. That was 9 weeks ago. Still no videos? There may be a SEB INK pen available soon... Amazing how here we are in a fairly successful campaign, and those running it are nowhere to be seen... No announcements on "we've met an extremely low goal that you all knew that we would from the start in the first hour of the campaign, no we're triple the requested amount at just over a day in with 33 and change more to go..." a cricket chirping would be deafening right about now. Why is it that most other campaigns have updates *constantly* to drum up interest and play up how awesome they are in the media, and yet this one is completely radio silent? +1 to the video request. No video before the end of campaign, I'm out. Would very much like a demo as well. I'm not going to withdraw backing just yet, but the selective answering of questions has me greatly concerned. If no new information materializes in the next week or so I am going to decrease my backing. @creator: can you please post a video demonstrating your working pen in action. Looking into this potential technology is very interesting indeed, however to me it is very much still potential, until the product is shown in a proper video demonstrating the actual prototype in use. They have mentioned that they have answered questions in their blog, however this is not being accountable in my eyes. The creator needs to address questions by using FAQ list and on here in the comments list, this will also double up as accountability within the Kickstarter project as opposed to using a third party website to discuss the technicalities of the product. @tyson exactly, what they actually 'demonstrated' in that video was an existing invention called a 'pen', the whole point of Scribble is the ability to change colours, and yet they completly managed to avoid showing that. @Dragonbait, I'd suspect that they *think* that they already showed that, even if only for a few seconds with their video. Still, it's an obvious case of "did you really think that two barely observable strokes on a piece of paper with a massive, already done drawing is what we're looking for?" Really easy case of "just grab the pen, scan an orange (you show it in your marketing pictures after all!) draw a line, scan a pair of jeans, draw another line, the end. No cuts, no fancy camera tricks, just start to finish what does one do to go from drawing Orange to drawing Blue. Stay calm, guys. :) There's still 33 days to the deadline, let's see if they produce any more solid information before we start pulling out the pitchforks. At worst, if we're not comfortable with the transparency level by the end of the backing period, we can just pull back our pledges to a few bucks and count it up as just a normal cost of Kickstarter backing. I think they've got a good idea here, although I would really like to see some actual hardware as well. @Wando, I just want answers to the more and more questions that keep poping up. Even if this product is 'real' they are being economical with the facts, do you think they would have admitted that the colour scanner can only ready 65k colours and not the intimated 16million without someone asking the question?? Why if they have a working prototype do they just show us renders and no pictures, let alone video, of the actual prototype? It would be very easy for them to show us a video scanning a colour drawing a line, scanning another colour and drawing another line, that would put alot of peoples concerns to bed in one easy stroke. I think this may be the working prototype that we've all been searching for: <url>"Much like writing with a red pen on black paper, the ink wouldn't show up without a base of white. But, I suspect that this isn't the reason that the engineers of the Scribble Pen added the complexity of white ink. If I want to print a pink highlight with an ink jet printer or on a web offset press, the approach is pretty simple. Don't put much ink down. Just a dribble of magenta ink, or just a sprinkling of tiny halftone dots. But if you are searching for that same color to paint your wall, you need a different solution. You need the same volume of paint, just less color. When mixing up a can of paint, the paint mixologist first reaches for a can of white base." The key difference between pigments and dyes is that a pigment ultimately resides "on top of" the page versus is "absorbed into" the page. How does the pen get power <url>"extra catridge" pledge. Would it be possible to pledge, lets say "50$" extra to your pledge to get an extra catridge? I really think that this project should have been filed under "technology" rather than design. First of all, love the product. But before I fully commit I got a few questions. 1: If I get the ink pen, what about refills ect? 2: Will I be able to upload the color I scanned on the ink pen to Photoshop. Or is this limited to the stylus? Thought I had more questions, but I guess this is it :P Sorry if these questions have already be answered, but I couldn't find any questions about it here. Nor on the actual kickstarter frontpage. @Abdul Halim Mat Ali Mm makes sense. Thanks! @Haruka Namiki. I don't think so. Else they would not create separate pledges. @Dragonbait. Not sure, Moment Smartwatch didn't show a new video but answer the technical questions and hence we know it is not a scam product. @Creator. If you have a prototype, please show a real time video or let tech bloggers demo it. Or is most of the technical questions answered already answered in your blog? If so, kindly inform us so that we are not skeptical about this pen. Not quite sure if anyone had already asked/answered this but can the Scribble INK be used as a STYLUS as well or are they solely for specific purposes? @tyson, they claim the ink is water resistant, which is also usually not the case for dyes. @abdul, Except they claim to already have a working prototype, so why won't they show it? This concept is phenomenal, but I really need to see a video of the Ink in action. I'm wondering how it can handle both a ballpoint and a brush tip? According to the blog, it currently takes 3-5 seconds to switch from one color to another. What are the color-changing rates on the different tips, along with tip lifespan? Though not ink, the 3Doodler is a similar concept and takes its time switching between colors. The body of the pen looks very thick to draw with. I hopped in for an Earlybird, but will pull my pledge if I don't see an update on the YouTube page soon. Could we please see some popular artists/designers testing the prototype, giving their opinions? Thanks! @Scribble Well, that certainly explains the disparity between the 16-bit sensor on the pen and the ability to use 24-bit colors in drawing. Could you please elaborate as to which type of water soluble dyes you are using that would allow you to write over over existing dyes, especially white dye over other colors? I've only ever seen those traits possible from a chemical standpoint using pigments rather than dyes, which you've explicitly stated that you have evaluated and are not using due to a cost concern. @Abdul That's what I'm advocating. Please wait until they have proven themselves before backing. Even though they don't get the money until the campaign finishes, your pledges bring legitimacy to what may not be a legitimate project and give them free publicity. Yes. It is just too early to decide Scribble is a scam. Give them time to proof their technical capability. I'm personally in the same boat. I was happy to give them the benefit of the doubt at first considering the solid articles posted online, however further review of their materials just leaves me with more questions that frankly shouldn't have any reason existing, such as how one can make water soluble white ink that can write *on* an existing already inked material, or how one can capture and use 16 million colors from a sensor that is only capable of representing 65,535 colors. I mean, 65 thousand is a lot and for all intents and purposes with this product it would essentially be the same thing, but why the *massive* disparity in information around every turn? There are obvious ways in which one *could* make a product such as this, but it seems as though the answers that we're being given about "how this one works" is crazy ideas pulled out of thin air with no regard to how engineering really works or without clearly thinking through the problem. I was so excited and pledge first and review later, but now i realized there's some serious air around here. I will confirm the amount of my pledge, after some questions/concerns are cleared. Hope "creator" clears this air soon. I'd personally say that "not getting an answer in 6 hours" isn't *THAT* bad, especially when there is 34 days 11 hours and 23 minutes to go until they get the money. I mean, comments can get buried easily... however on the flip side, Dropkicker is right that their responses tend to be of a nature of "I want to give you money, how can I most effectively do so?" nature rather than a "Help me to believe that this is on the level." Technical questions tend to be getting ignored in favor of "pleze give us moar monay!" @CC They delayed their original cam paid over a month, and they've been developing this product for "over two years". They've had plenty of time to get their ducks in a row. The fact that they're selectively choosing to avoid technical questions while answering sales questions indicates that they're not exactly overwhelmed. Nobody here owes them anything. Hold on to your money people until they show some evidence that their product is real. Keep the comment area simple, with organization. Line the questions up and give them a chance to answer. It will become clear pretty quickly. Before we light the fire let's let them get there last words in. I would remain patient. And give them a chance to align there ducks in one row before jumping to conclusions. There are a lot of suspicions in the air. But this show will go on for 34 more days. Let's Starting to have concerns about this and haven't received a response from my post 6 hours ago...I may have to pull out from this... Scribble, in your Website's FAQ, you list that your ink's are a conventional "dye" rather than a pigment specifically citing cost concerns, however in the same sentence you state that you also can achieve pure white using this method. Considering the nature of how dyes work, this doesn't seem possible. Perhaps you could explain what type of white dye you are using to accomplish this effect. Actually.. I'm going to jump off the bandwagon because of the fishy aroma in the air. I love me some sushi, but this one doesn't seem fresh. And I was stupid in my posting, 16-bit is 65,536, I have no idea what I was thinking there... Gave 18 bit for some stupid reason which is itself meaningless. Yeah, I am a little concerned that those engineering this product would use the terms "16 bit color" and "16 million colors" interchangeably, considering that 16-bit = 262,144 colors, when 24-bit = 16 million colors. Don't get me wrong, 262,144 is still a lot and realistically "enough" for a pen such as this, but an engineer should be able to know the difference. I didn't get it though lol Dang, beat me to it! I'll take it Super early bird even! Early bird available if anyone wants it! I'm convinced this is at best 'not as described ' and, as I suspect,at worst a complete scam. So I'm dropping my early bird pledge down to 1$ to allow me to comment. I hope I'm wrong but this has all the hallmarks of a scam project. @Johnny, The size of the mixing chamber doesn't leave much room in the pen for the 5 pumps, flow sensors, nib sensor, ink resevoirs, arm9 processor, bluetooth 4 chip, usb port and chip, LED light, Colourimeter, 1GB storage chip, wiring, pipes, Lithium ion charge controller, and a lithium ion battery to power it all. @Creator, How are you scanning 16million colours with a 16 bit colour sensor exactly? I noticed quite a few of you here were wondering about the color switching process for the ink. I did some digging and found this on their last blog post: "RETO June 18, 2014 at 6:07 am Interesting product. Let us say i will scribble in the colour of a dark blue then i would like to continue in a bright yellow. For how long will i get a “dirty” yellow, because there must be some blue ink residues in the tip? SCRIBBLE June 23, 2014 at 10:49 am Hi Reto The Scribble Pen comes standard with a tip cleaning device. This will allow you to easily get rid of existing left over colors." Thought this might help a bit, although I'm still curious as to how efficient this process might be, as Tyson Edwards brought attention to the seemingly large mixing chamber. I hope the creators can shed some light on this topic! Well, this certainly gives me a pause... <url>"Apples to Oranges" comparison between the two. Or does the 64 pledge come with the extra tips? because if so then i'm set :) How much will the extra tips for the stylus be? I just pledged for 64 but I think in the future I will want to purchase the extra tips. @Duncan A very interesting Last minute change. Their blog still says $3-10. <url>"How much would the ink cartridge cost ? We estimate an average price of $15-$30 Last updated: Mon, Aug 11 2014 4:35 PM EDT" Is that per color or for all colors? Either way they say they have working prototypes, so why are they showing us renderings and mockups and not a working prototype!? Not to mention the other questions that are bugging me about this project! @Tyson they only have 3 Rules these days, Cant sell prohibited items (guns, drugs etc), They must create something (cant just use it as a store for an existing project), and you have to honestly presented (which includes Photo realistic renderings are prohibited) <url>"reviewing" campaigns and that it's entirely "backer beware"? Wow, news to me! I'm really starting to think this is a scam. @Creator, please can you show us some photos of your prototype as per kickstarter rules. You are already breaking the rules by showing 'photorealistic' renders of the pens. I would like to know how the pen will keep old color choices from mixing with new ones as well as how the pen will draw exact lines vs just spilling ink out everywhere. A demonstration of the product would be awesome. I am also curious if I can add a SEB stylus along with an INK pen. Thanks! I got the SEB ink pen. Can I add $64 to my pledge to get the SEB stylus? Thanks. That's awesome, I'm really glad to hear it comes with the full tip set at the $149 level! Hi, I just pledged for the $149 early bird ink pen special, I wondered can I now go and pledge for the $64 early bird stylus? Or can you only do it once? And also it did not ask for the color I wanted at check out will this be done later? I see in the Q&A below that the $149 early bird pen special includes full tip set and ink cartridge set; however this was not listed when ordering that offer. Thank you! Will there be warranties for these? Since these are the first production, I'm worried there might be some glitches and whatsnot that'll affect the pen qualities in the long run. I wouldn't want to spend $64 buying a regular stylus in the event that the color sensor malfunctions. Great idea, i am dubious though. There are so many different aspects of this idea that need to be explained in-depth. I am not saying it won't work as truthfully I have no idea how it works. But I want to be wrong and would like you to address my concerns (Please note my concerns are that of many others also). - How will the ink switch from one colour to the next without picking up previous residue? - How accurate will the colour matching be for the stylus version? (The green folder in your video, and then on the tablet, although similar, were not the same tone to my eyes). I won't overload my comment with too many questions for now, but this would certainly help my understanding of your product. I want to stress i'm not being negative I just want to clear my doubts before recommending this to other people! @Scribble That's great (that the early price levels include nib sets and cartridges). It is very clear now. Thanks for the reply. Congrats on crushing your goal today, too! Is the Super Early Bird price lvl for the INK the only one that comes with the nib set, or does the $64 price lvl for the STYLUS also come with a set? Do we have stretch goals coming? :D Congratulation ! You reached the goal really easy ! @Dropkicker, thanks for the image from archive.org, that is certainly quite helpful... All I need to say there is ho-lee-crap, that's one big mixing chamber! Even *a* few drops of ink in a fountain pen is enough to write out a sentence or two. A chamber of that size is enough to write out the first half of a novel before one would be able to change colors. Scribble, care to provide an update as to how "mixing" takes place, as well as a demo video of uninterrupted use and mechanisms of a color change? Hello ! what's the difference between a "scribble ink pen" and a "re-calibratable scribble ink pen" ? many thanks for your reply ! Marie (from France) Does the early bird special -149- come with nib set and ink ? Scouring their website's FAQs looks like it provides something of the answer to the ink price question. "Is it true an INK refill would cost me an arm and a leg? Absolutely NOT. The Scribble ink cartridges would be very affordable to the public and won’t be very pricey at all. Expected price – $3-$10" @Tyson Here's an image from an older version of their site: <url>"mixing chamber" or said diagram to which you are referring, so I obviously have less information than you do upon which to base my decision on the project. I'd personally have suspected that they would have done a much smaller "droplet" style dispersion system inside the nib or as close to it as to limit the amount of wasted ink as possible and thereby reduce the time between color changes, but that's just me guessing as an engineer myself. I would however completely agree that "color matching" is a very easy task and has been accomplished many times before in quite cost effective means. Considering that the pen can draw in white, it would appear obvious that yes it uses either a form of gel or pigment rather than conventional ink. Rather than continue to give my opinion on how I'd design the pen though, I'll leave it up to the team to explain how they've overcome these challenges and created a product that will work reliably and provide for rapid color changes without writing an additional page or two to empty the nib. @FranSan from their FAQ, though it doesn't address the cartridge size. "Would I be able to refill just one of the colors or would I have to buy all of them at once? You will be able to replace a single color." ml of each color in the ink cartridge ? Can we change each color separately or all when one color is finished ? I'll happily take someones super early bird pledge if they don't want it anymore! So, I'm slightly confused. You said down below "@ Abdul Halim Mat Ali Super early birds get both a nib and ink cartridge set" is the difference then between this and the 199$ level that the 199$ comes with two ink cartridges and multiple nibs, vs the 119 and 149$ sets only coming with the ink cartridge in the pen and the nib on the pen? Qestion: The Early Bird at the $149 level does not come with the nib set or the spare cartridge, but it obviously comes with *a* nib. What size is that nib by default, or is that something that will be able to be chosen before it ships? Been waiting for this one for quite a while, really hope it pans out! :) Can you answer Allen's other question regarding switching colors? I asked similar questions in an email to you over a month ago and have not gotten an answer. Grabbing a color off an object is not difficult. Just look up Huey the Chameleon (a children's toy). The Stylus version of the product looks very believable (just a color sensor, LED, and some software). The ink version however is substantially more complicated. @Tyson, inkjet printers operate by spraying microscopic dots of ink onto a page. No color mixing actually occurs inside the print head which means there's no need to dispose of any mixed ink between colors (which change in a fraction of a second as the machine prints). These require precise spacing between the print head and the sheet of paper. I don't think this is possible inside a pen. Besides, they show in their diagrams that the pen has a "mixing chamber" which implies that some other technology is used. Even with that, print heads do need automatic cleaning occasionally as ink will dry up and clog them. This pen is shown briefly in the video as what looks like a gel pen that extrudes a very thick almost paint-like ink. At the very least, the user will have to wipe the extra ink off the end of the pen, but there will have to be some way to extrude the ink inside the pen as well. @Scribblepen, can you please provide a video demonstrating the full operation of the Pen version of the product? Scanning a color, drawing, scanning another color, drawing, etc? Thank you. @Gnat: Doesn't seem to be the case. I think the best bet is the $199 pledge-- from the add-ons, seems like the best deal. Hopefully creator can respond regarding this though. From what's included in the rewards descriptions, there's a lot of stuff missing in the Super Early Bird $119 so I've switched my pledge. @allen chang On the flip side, this product doesn't seem *that* different than an inkjet printer, and those seem *quite* realistic. Considering the number of Kickstarter scams that there have been as of late (especially those in the Tech area), it is always good to approach something with a skeptical eye and want to verify that it is in fact a legitimate offering and not yet another money grab from a gullible audience. This product doesn't really sound realistic. How can a pen mix inks within itself to reproduce a color? And if a color were produced, wouldnt the pen nib have leftovers from the previous color, thereby muddling the newly produced color? Also the video shows the putting the sensor directly on the surface to scan the color - wouldnt doing that reduce the light reflected and affect the accuracy? If you could please post real-time videos that show that the pen does what its intended and on surfaces which are a color other than your typical $3 multicolored pen, it would help our skepticism. @Scribble Thank for the responses today, and congrats on your kickstarted launch! Your statement "Super early birds get both a nib and ink cartridge set" is confusing. The reward level at $119 does not state that. Just to be clear, are you saying that the $119 SUPER EARLY BIRD SPECIAL - ONE Scribble INK Pen is exactly that same as the $199 reward level that includes the nib and ink cartridge set, but at the super early price level? Also, when you refer to nibs for the INK pen, do you mean nibs (or tips, perhaps) that adjust the line width when written on paper? In other words, the pens nibs are not stylus nibs that allow the pen to be used on a tablet, correct? Could you post how to retrieve a color which is stored previously in Scribble INK? Do I have to use the mobile app to retrieve colors? Could you please post how many ml of each color ink is within a cartridge so that we can better know how much writing / drawing we can do before we need to get a new refill? Additionally, can you please speak to the battery and the length of charge during use as well as standby? Understandably, this one may change with further optimization, so the mAh of the battery and ARM CPU Generation would be helpful to determine the "worst case" scenario. Finally, you state that additional ink cartridges will be available for purchase, however there is not pricing for their cost. Can you please post their cost for us? If this is unknown, a ballpark range would be quite appreciated (1-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-40, ... per ink vs. a set) @creator I've added $29 to my pledge but was unable to select 2 so i've currently selected the $119 super early bird can you add the other one for me or what should i do? *your *it, damn it :) This is one of those pieces of technology that is going to be a game changer. Can't wait to see where this goes. If you going to only own one pen then this is is :) Hi I have pledged for the 119 dollar early bird ink stylus, does this come with an ink cartridge? If not what will the cost of an ink cartridge be? This would be useful information! @ Creator - thank you for jumping on these questions! Great product, I can't wait to take it for a test drive! RE: The Super Early Bird - you said it includes "a nib and ink cartridge set" - is that a set of each, or a single nib, and a cartridge set? (Sorry to be pedantic, but it impacts how consumers will proceed). Thanks! @ Brendon Shack - I already had the same thought once I realized there was no limit on the $199 level :) Thanks for the recommendation. Sorry I meant the $199 level. @Robert Sloan jump on the super early bird special before it goes. You can always change to the $189 version later because it has no backer limit. Can we add extra nib set or ink cartridge set? going to have some stretch goals? @Dragonbait. You can voice out your concern as it may help fellow backers too I backed this project, but something about it is niggling with me, I'm starting to question if this is a scam kickstarter? Can i please get a Scribble black ball point pen and note book as well so i can give that to my sister? I can't seem to select more than one thing. Does the Scribble INK version basically turn into a SYYLUS pen with the attachment of one of the nibs? I believe that are extra nib and cartridges. Else what's the purpose of super early bird +1 to more clarification on the nibs set for super early backers Could you reply my PM? I would like to know what the cost of a set of nibs would be. Right now, based on the rewards, its a $35 dollar difference between a Super Early Bird Stylus Pen and the Stylus Pen & Nib set @ J. Thomson, I completely agree - it's best to know the authoritative answer on all counts. A price break down will help consumers plan their purchase better. I'm with Abdul, I'd like to know what is specifically omitted from the Super Early Bird, and I'd also like to know what the prices are for the additional items - the next level that specifies both cartridges and nibs is $80 more... @Robert Sloan, The "offer" part makes me think they will be selling those sizes. I'm interested in seeing a What's In the Box breakdown type of thing. In order to plan for any Add-Ons that would be needed after the campaign. Glad to see this finally becoming reality! Do wonder how much the extra nibs and cartridges will go for though as I went with what I could afford :) J. Thomson, the specs state that there are 6 sizes: "We offer 6 tip sizes, 0.3mm, 0.5mm, 1.0mm, 1.5mm, 2.5mm and 3.71mm" Abdul, that's the way it appears, that's why I bumped up my pledge to the $199 level - I want to be dead certain that I get everything I need... but it does make me wonder if 6 nibs and a cartridge set are worth $80... @Creator. The super early bird don't get the nib and the cartridge set? How many nib sizes come with Scribble INK? What are the prices for additional nib kits? How long should ink last with general use? Will nib kits and additional ink be offered as Add-Ons? Thanks! Excellent! I've been waiting for this one for a while! A couple of questions, though: How much will replacement cartridges cost? And, What kind of warranty will these have? I imagine a LOT of travel and use with these products, ink will run dry, and accidents will happen... Finally!
