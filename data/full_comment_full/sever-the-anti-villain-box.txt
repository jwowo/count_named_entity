Ian, you are correct. Sever WILL NOT hinder your speeds. it will in fact increase your speeds. Just a shout out to JP our very FIRST backer!! JP you ROCK!!! Hey Sarah, We at Rogue are dedicating this box to internet privacy, our belief in net neutrality have brought us together to ensure that everyone has the right to private digital lives. With that in mind, we are making Sever as easy as possible. We know sometimes simple isn't simple, so there will be a support line for all of our customers. I agree with the comment below. I still have a hard time believing this was a scam. Granted I thought some of the claims were a bit optimistic (like the claim that my internet speed would have improved 10 times), but still I am not that techie and they would have made little difference in my decision to back them, if only some communication from these guys would have addressed some of the concerns. Are you guys still around? Man, an explanation would be nice. I know people are calling you out as a scam but I don't always trust those quick to shout wolf.. They don't always hold all the cards, I mean these ideas on kickstarter are supposed to be potential game changers.. But no good explanation, or simply none at all tells me these guys didn't have their stuff together, especially not enough to take a 100k investment.. you are the type of projects who are starting to give kickstarter a bad rep.. Gonna have to start screening projects more thoroughly... Why wait so much time on this and fall majorly short? Wow, thanks for pointing out the scam guys, I almost lost some dough ï¿½ That's too bad. I was looking forward to this project. It sounded like a great idea. This project is clearly a scam. They've made absurd claims, don't respond to anyone who questions them, and are just blatantly trying to steal people's money. For anyone who wants more information on what I'm mentioning, see this GitHub post: <url>#15 for super early bird! :D Woo! So is this essentially a VPN attached on your own side just outside of your router so ALL of your traffic is encrypted from the machine and outbound? I hate Comcast listening to my traffic. I currently use PIA, will I still be able to use it with Sever? Will I no longer need a VPN? Some more in-depth technical documentation on this would be great if you guys have that set up anywhere else. This is an amazing idea... I will do my part and spread the word!! Looks fantastic, can't wait to use it! Will it be powered strictly via separate AC? What about PoE or possibly have an internal battery for taking with you to your favorite hotspot? Just to be sure. these won't hinder our speeds at all. They are capable of 100+mbps Hi there, I'm a tech idiot. So would a helpline or support email be available for us to ask questions if there's a need? Thanks! :) Sounds like a great project and I hope it succeeds. Will my unit have the lowest number?
