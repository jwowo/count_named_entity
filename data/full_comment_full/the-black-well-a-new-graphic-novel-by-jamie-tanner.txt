Thanks, Andreas! Jamie, the print I got last week is awesome! Keep up the great work. this is exciting! I love The Aviary and am looking forward to new work! (and an awesome poster of The Quiet Bird-Man and a Squid with glasses high fiving...everything I've always wanted in a poster) Indeed! Your artwork looks just great. I can't wait to have The Aviary in my hands! My only regret is that I can't pledge more... Good luck, Jamie. Hi Jamie and good luck with Black Well. I missed your fisrt time, but now you're back, so thanks for the opportunity!
