@Stevie The iOS zip file actually contains the Hydra's firmware source as well (for Atmel Studio). James, you will be happy to know that your Hydra is shipping tomorrow. :-D Thanks, Chris! The feedback is very much appreciated. Hi Larry, They haven't all shipped. We had some problems with enclosures and are waiting for the last batch of new enclosures to come from the anodizer. It'll definitely happen next week. Our first priority is to get the rest of the preorders shipped, which means working out the kinks in the bluetooth expansion boards and finalizing the iPhone and Android software. We'll look into the OS X version of the control software after that. In the mean-time, you can access the basic functionality of the Hydra from a serial terminal. Glenn - I'm not familiar with KCL experiments, but note that you cannot connect the Hydra outputs in series - their grounds are tied together. Hi Nick, There will be once all the bluetooth stuff is ready (we aren't quite there yet). The bluetooth expansion board will be available for purchase from www.chrobotics.com Ah, sorry. I still need to get the rest of the documentation finished. The baud rate is 14400. Brett, we don't have any adapters for the AC-DC converters that come with the Hydra, nor do we have an alternative version that is compatible with different types of outlets and voltages. Backers with different types of outlets will need to use a converter. Fabian, send me a message to change your shipping address if you haven't already. Yes, definitely. I'm not completely sure on the timeline since right now we are focused on getting everything else out the door, but once we are caught up we'll be looking more seriously into it. Thanks for pointing that out, Keith. I'll change the wording so that it is more clear. I'll also change the expected ship date to be more realistic. Hi Hashish, The price on our website was a pre-order price like what was on Kickstarter. In case you might feel slighted, note that the price on our website did not include shipping, so the Kickstarter preorder and the preorder from our website would have worked out to be the same. The Bluetooth board does NOT include bluetooth communication at the $179.00 price point. Hi Keith, Yes, very much so. We are getting very close to shipping the first pre-orders. Stay tuned! HI Glenn, Yes, the assembled PCBs are starting to trickle in. We received the first 16 yesterday and are in the process of testing them. They should all arrive before the end of next week if all goes well. And they should arrive this week, if they are true to their word. :-) We are still waiting to receive the completed PCBs from the fabrication house. The Hydra won't be able to top off a 12V lead-acid battery, though it will be able to charge it most of the way. Not since last week, but stay tuned - there are more updates on the way. Hey Paul, Unfortunately, we've been held back by some long-lead parts. We are crossing our fingers that they will get here next week. After that, we'll start cranking them out. Regardless, we should be able to start shipping well before the end of the month. Haha, thanks Charlie. I did learn recently that designers basically hate Comic Sans. What font would you recommend? Maybe in the future. We've actually already ordered the power supplies we'll be sending with the rewards, so its a little late to make the switch now. Ah, I see. Yes, the iPhone/Android device could definitely log the data. We weren't planning on adding that functionality, but it probably wouldn't be at all hard to do. Hey James, sorry about that. I missed the question. The Hydra doesn't have enough memory resources to log any appreciable amount of data. Any kind of serial datalogger could record data reported by the Hydra, though. I think Sparkfun has some decent data loggers for cheap. Hi Ken, The power supply outputs are not isolated, so the outputs can not be connected either in series or in parallel. Thanks, James. The Hydra can't discharge batteries, but it does apply the correct charging cycles for lithium cells (CC followed by CV while tracking power delivered). Yes, it will. When you change the voltage (or current limit), the background color of the display box will change while it updates the supply. After it is updated, the actual supply voltage and current will be displayed. This isn't happening in the video, but the software does it properly now. @Tim, Yes, the expansion port consists of four pins, Vin, GND, and USART tx and rx. Any expansion board must actually communicate serially. The protocol will be documented. The USB connection is not FTDI, but it does show up as a serial port on your computer. @Timothy Giles, The connectors are screw terminals, with the exception of the USB and expansion ports. If enough EU customers sign up, we might include a plug adapter, but the same wall adapter will be provided. @Colin, Yes, the Bluetooth expansion and other accessories will be available for purchase later as well. Yes, it does. It should even handle the transient spikes from the alternator. That's a great idea Keith! It's probably a little late to make that happen on the Hydra, but maybe that's something that could be done in the future. If not by CH Robotics, then maybe someone else. I'd love to see it. Maybe when we hit $30k (which should happen soon at this rate), we can make it a priority to make a cheap external knob interface for the expansion port. If it doesn't need an enclosure, we could knock it out quickly and for cheap, and send it out with all the Kickstarter Hydras we ship in April. I'll look into it... Yeah, we could release a schematic of a knob-based expansion fairly quickly. The design would be simple: 1) Three digital POTs forming three resistive voltage dividers. 2) An MCU (even an Arduino) to read the voltages 3) A UART connection from the MCU to the Hydra to control and read the output voltages and, optionally 4) Some kind of display to show the output voltages. Could be a 7-segment or a small LCD display. I'm guessing that someone with an Ardiuno background could throw something functional together in a day. Literally. @Nathan, The Hydra can't do negative voltages right now, but future versions might. We'd need to remove one of the positive supplies and design an adjustable negative output for it. You aren't the first person to ask this, so we are looking seriously at making a version with a negative output. Hi Brad, Yes, the aluminum case is grounded to provide shielding. Also, we could definitely throw together a quick knob-based expansion board that would work, but I'm not sure that we could have it ready by April, and if we could, it may not be as sleek and professional as the Hydra itself. BUT, we definitely plan to release that kind of expansion eventually, probably a few months after its official release in April. Thomas, that's a possibility we've considered. We shied away from offering an enclosure-less option because we really wanted to go for a nice, professional feel. But we may make an OEM version available when we start selling them through our website. The aluminum enclosure actually adds quite a bit of weight, and for some people, that really matters. Here's a thought, though - if flelxibility is desired, there are other things we can do that might make the supply more convenient. Right now, a downside to the Hydra is that you have to be connected to a computer or phone to visualize the output voltages and currents. This was a tradeoff we made to keep the costs and size down. But since the Hydra can communicate with any serial device over its expansion port, it would be possible (and even fairly easy) to design an expansion board with control knobs and even a small display to show the output and input voltage/current levels. Would this interest you? Kenneth and Brad - Adding an option to allow the supplies to be serially connected would be great, I agree. Unfortunately, this would require a fairly significant change to the switching topology, necessitating a substantial redesign (unless there is some way to do it that I'm not aware of!) Perhaps a future design will accommodate that requirement. Josh, Your point about security is a very good one! We hadn't considered that, but now that we're aware of the problem, we can add a feature for requiring a customizable password to connect to the device. Great feedback1 Hey Josh, Good questions. See below: 1) The efficiency is in the mid 90% range for output currents around 1 amp. Naturally, as the output current decreases, so does the efficiency. There is a special low-current, high efficiency mode that improves the low current efficiency, but the max output drops by quite a bit. 2) The limitation here is going to be the serial connection. Even via USB, the connection to the Hydra is converted to 38400 baud TTL UART. Given the required packet size of about 8 bytes, it will take 2 milliseconds to send each switching message to the Hydra. This means that the absolute maximum rate you could achieve would be 500 Hz. And this doesn't include turn-on and turn-off time. 3) There are a couple fault conditions. If the supply overheats, it will drop its output voltage. An overcurrent condition will also cause the voltage to drop. In either case, the controller will detect the change and (if connected to a compute) send a message indicating a voltage fault. We could have the supply be disabled if a fault is detected as well - that would be a software addition. 4) That's right - as long as the voltage fed back into the device is less than 14V, it should be fine. 5) Hmm, that's a good point. With a 12V max output limit, charging 12V batteries would take quite some time. I'll have a look at this. 6) Input, output, and other status monitoring happens via the computer interface. To be informed of the power status, it must be connected to a computer or some other device capable of reading the serial packets. 7) We don't have any specs on the humidity operating range yet (though there shouldn't be any major limitations). The temperature operating range goes from m-40 to +85 C. Hi Thomas, The board is actually not frail - the tinned lines just lack the soldermask (this is to allow an electrical connection to the enclosure and for better heat transfer). At 2.5A, you can expect to see transient switching spikes on the order of 100mV. Their duration is very short, but they are there. We'll be recording some actual data soon to include in the datasheet (also in the works). My Hydra still works. I used the Redshift Serial Interface V3.1.5 for controlling it via Usb. <url>"damnit, where's my Hydra". Hard not to be a little frustrated as it was due in April, and I just blew something up (my own stupidity) by trying to improvise a Hydra. Caleb I'm holding you accountable for letting the smoke out of my UCC37321P, may it weigh heavily on your conscience ;) I just hooked up my Hydra tonight and have to say it is pretty friggin amazing. This is one slick product you have here. I really hope this sells well for you. /thumbsup Hi Caleb, Still awaiting word on my Hydra with bluetooth expansion board(^-^) The Oct 31 update indicated all would be shipped by the following week -was that the case? Thanks in advance for your reply. Congrats on the Project. Larry Any update on the bluetooth expansion boards? I've received my Blue Hydra and so far it looks nice. I am using a mac and attempting to use the driver and Hydra program on a VMware installation of win Vista has resulted in two BSODs. Is there a timeline as to when we will be able to use the Smart Power Supply Control Software natively on OSX ? Any update on the Bluetooth modules? I'd love to have my Hydra to use... Hi Caleb. My black Hydra landed in my hands yesterday. I'm in Italy. I had to pay about $35 in vat and taxes. I'm VERY happy for the product. thanks. Mario Hi Caleb.. I just started Electrical Engineering and I'm wondering if it was possible to use the Hydra for KCL experiments. I've been given the impression in my lectures that having 2 or more different voltage sources connected in series is a bad thing, perhaps I've misinterpreted the forewarning but in anycase, is there anything I need to know before I put 2 or 3 voltage sources in my circuit using the Hydra? Hi Caleb, mine just arrived in the Netherlands. Congratulations on finishing this project, it must at times have seemed an endless journey for you. It's even smaller than I imagined it. Only one word applies: AWESOME! Look forward to using it in my next project. Caleb. Hi from Sweden, wanted to let you know mine arrived, perfect condition. 70 dollars (440SEK) of import tax (darn government). Used it for the first time today. Fantastic case, love the material, finish looks and feels bomb proof. The software works well, great to see the videos online. Downloaded the instructions, well written and complete. Good luck for the future, thanks for you and your colleagues hard work. I have now used it, and it's... BADASS! I used it for a custom photo box, I have it controlling 3 different lights, LOVE IT! PWM would of been even better though. I received mine, but haven't had time to even unpack the box, but I appreciate it and it looks great! Sweet...my Hydra showed up yesterday and works great. I have already put it to work powering my project: "The Phone Cop" Thanks. Any one know of some low profile banana plugs that would work well with this? Caleb, I've already received my Hydra and it looks so cool... Unfortunately I don't have a windows box. Is there a way to just purchase the Bluetooth/Wifi module so I can use an iOS/Android device? Thanks! Thanks for such a nice product, Caleb. Just got mine, and it's working flawlessly. A few months ago you mentioned it'd be possible to monitor status via the serial connection. What is the speed of the connection? I tried 38400 (and everything from 9600 to 115200), 8N1, no control flow, and I only get garbage. Seems it is outputting something, but I'm not being able to read it properly. Being an aussie, the power adaptor will not be compatible for me, without an adaptor for Australia. Are these kind of things standard? I'd prefer to slot out the US based one, and replace with the AU version, rather than a bulky international travel adapter is that is possible. Will have a chance to change my shipping address if I recently moved? Caleb - I was wondering if you were still planning on producing a WiFi control module? I know it was tied to a $100k stretch goal, but wasn't sure if that product was still on the table as a future add-on even if you didn't reach the funding goal. The wording on the website would lead me to think that it does include Bluetooth. It says so twice in the description, and I don't see anything that would imply there exists a non-Bluetooth Hydra (or an add-on Bluetooth module). It also says (twice) that they will ship in July. The pricing appears to have been updated recently though - it shows $198 to me. I am confused about the website description. I though the Hydra retail price was to be $200, but the website shows its $179? Also the description shows that the Hydra includes bluetooth communication under the $179 price point. With the shop hardware repaired and operational again, is there a light at the end of the tunnel now? (and not the oncoming train variety) how about an update? I'm excited for the new Case! any updates? its been 2 weeks. almost forgot i backed this project. So it is May 30th guys, what is the status of things? :) Just a question, don't you need above 14V oftentimes to charge a SLA (14.7V)? <url>#) and maybe able to re-use the data communication code. Well, if you are going to really put more than a few seconds of thought into your application's UI, then you might as well do it right... Segoe UI is the standard font for Windows 7 and Windows 8, as well as Office 2013. Segoe UI should be used for primary UI elements such as buttons, dropdowns, etc. For short sections of editable text, you should be using Calibri. If you have large sections of text (more than a paragraph or so), then Cambria is what should be used. Windows 8 UI Guidelines (typography): <url>"Modern" layout): <url>"official" guidance for Desktop apps, but most seem to be adopting something that very closely resembles the guidelines for Modern Windows Store Apps in my second link. Caleb, I'd recommend a monospace sans-serif (equal width per letter/character, and no extra decorations). Consolas looks like a decent compromise of computery/LCD feel while being modern and readable: <url>"instructions" I use to be into Arduino then I moved into CNC stuff and it all just sits in a container awaiting my return. Great job on fast responses BTW, it pays off, trust me. :) I understand the "official stuff", how about a schematic, and free software, or? hi! i was planning to use this as a roaming pwr supply for my old arcade and PC's machines while i'm repairing them. The supplies are generally in a horrid spot and a pain in the neck to get to, so this would solve a lot of fiddling. Any chance you could set the voltages to minus ranges? (i.e. the boards require a -5v and -12v range too) thanks! "expansion board with control knobs and even a small display to show the output and input voltage/current levels. Would this interest you?" DEFINITELY! Since your limiting this to Bluetooth 4.0, that stops about 75% of us from using it away from the PC, which is a HUGE drawback, and controlling from Bluetooth was actually the ONLY reason I pledged, then I found out about the 4.0 deal and downgraded my pledge in hopes that you find a solution for it, The idea is AWESOME, but if I can't use it the way I want/understood then.... Does it act like a Faraday cage in someway aswell? Can an open frame be made available at a lower cost. Lowering the cost would make them practical to leave behind with each project, and then buy a new one for your next project. Put your logo on the silk screen. What level of security will there be on the bluetooth expansion? How much trouble would a third party have to go through in order to modify someone else's voltage settings via bluetooth? Regarding my list of other questions (below), if you've got a forthcoming spec sheet that will cover it, then rough answers are fine. Very cool item. I really like the feature set. Perhaps my only wish was that the price was a little more accessible to hobbyists. Anyhow, my own questions: 1. How is the conversion efficiency? Are there particular weak or strong spots in the efficiency curve? 2. How fast can I alter or duty cycle an output? (What is the maximum rate you can send changes, and what is the typical/maximum delay for the new voltage to be realized in the output?) 3. What happens when I draw too much current? Voltage sag? Timed breaker? Software controlled breaker? Breaker flipped until the unit resets? 4. Since it has a battery charging mode, I'm guessing that feeding outside voltages into the outputs won't hurt it? Even if they mismatch? 5. I wish the voltage output cap of 12v was just a little bit higher. Will it be able to effectively charge 12v batteries? 6. Is there a provision for input, output, or other status monitoring? 7. Environmental operating range? Temperature, humidity? Thanks. I agree with Kenneth, Functionality is why we are all here. Instead of colors, how about adding the ability to series and parallel the outputs? That would be more useful. I see. From the pictures the tinned lines looked like cut-outs! ~Thanks Great product! Can you explain the PCB mounting concept. It's hard to gather from the pictures. The board shape seems deliberately frail. Did a consolidated board shape suffer noise problems? What is ripple at 2.5A? (The listed max current at 5V)
