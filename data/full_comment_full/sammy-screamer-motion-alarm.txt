Bless you Bruno! Latest comment ever :) Where have you been!? We'll email you through the BleepBleeps helpdesk and get you fixed up... Hi Deborah, we're sorry you haven't received your Sammy yet. It looks like you haven't given us your address. We've emailed you through the BleepBleeps Helpdesk :) Thanks Simon! We are currently working on 3 new products and BleepBleeps Cloud :) full steam ahead! What! Simon we're so sorry about that. Shipping error. We'll email you now. Hi Jack - we've emailed you :) Oh no Clifford! You must have slipped through the net! We've emailed you from the Helpdesk - apologies for the delay and thank you for patience. You're welcome Stephen - glad we fixed you up :) Hi Stephen - we've emailed you through the BleepBleeps Helpdesk Oh dear Marco there must be a shipping problem - we've emailed you from <email> @Brad - strange. We've messaged you through Kickstarter... @brad we emailed you through the BleepBleeps Helpdesk on Thu, 2 Jul at 9:37 AM. We have just resent the message :) @brad looks like we missed that one. We'll contact you asap through <email> @Ion we've emailed you through the BleepBleeps Helpdesk at <email> Hi Pietro - we shipped a while ago so there must have been some kind of shipping error with your order. We've emailed you through the BleepBleeps Helpdesk. And congratulations on the birth of your daughter! Sammy will be there soon too - don't worry :) @Joaquin sorry about that! We've emailed you through the BleepBleeps Helpdesk We've emailed you Vinston :) Oh that is strange spongefile. We'll email you... Yes Jonatan you should have received Sammy a few weeks ago. We'll email you through the Helpdesk @Christoph nearly there! We have partially rolled out to Google Play. Full rollout happening in a few hours after we are sure the first batch are crash free :) Hi Temu, we've replied through the BleepBleeps Helpdesk - you should have an email from <email> shortly Good news Temu! Thanks for letting us know :) Hi Mark, Sammy should've been with you by now - we've emailed you from the Helpdesk Hi Temu, that is not normal! We've sent you an email from <email> - in the meantime please follow the reset process: <url>ão - we'll email you from the helpdesk Hi Laurent - should be any day now :) If nothing turns up this week let us know on <email> Hang tight João should be any day now :) Yay Sarawuth, Temu, Max and Christopher! Thanks for letting us know! @Christopher - Android Lollipop version coming end of May :) She's coming @Brian :) we've had word from as far and wide as San Francisco and Australia today. @joseph oh that's good to hear, glad we've got you fixed up :) @joseph how peculiar, our apologies. We'll email you through the BleepBleeps Helpsesk :) Thanks @Brian - glad we got you working! @mark don't stress :) Sammy is winding her way to you! We are still hearing of backers receiving in the US and even the UK so NZ will be any day now! Yesssss! thanks @Kyle - much appreciated. Even more appreciated with you having backed 68 projects :) #expert @Brian - sorry about that we'll contact you through the Helpdesk :) @Borja should be any day now - you are one of 24 Spanish backers :) We don't have tracking I'm afraid but Sammy is dropping in the U.S. since last week: <url>� <url>#SammyScreamer :) @Marc sorry about that. We'll contact you through <email> and get you fixed up! Yes we have word from the California - Sammys are dropping: <url>ão for our Kickstarter fulfilment we opted for Royal Mail Max Sort and Standard Airmail options and I'm afraid we can't provide tracking codes with these options. However any purchases made from our website will get a tracking code :) @João we've asked our fulfilment partner if tracking numbers are available. Will update you asap :) @John thanks for your comment! Correct, we currently don't support Android version 5.0+ yet. We've actually made a Lollipop version but can't release it yet as Bluetooth behaves very differently on Android version 5.0 than it does on 4.0. We are working on fixing the issues right now and hope to release a new version of the BleepBleeps Android app that is compatible with 5.0+ in late May. <url>"design" (as you suggested @P.H) they approve final apps (mostly functionally) and then publish them on iTunes. The app has been built in tandem with the physical product over the last year but couldn't be finalised until the hardware was completed too. App approval is the last piece of the puzzle and we are having some positive dialogue with Apple as of last week. We hope to get approval any day now so we can start shipping to all our backers around the world. Can't wait for you all to meet Sammy! Tom and Team BleepBleeps @thurman we are using Backerkit to manage surveys and shipping addresses. You can edit your info here: <url>ánchez Ramírez: Android App is ready to rock and requires no approval so will be instantly live on Google Play when we start to ship. Shouldn't be much longer now, thanks so much for your patience! oh thanks Sydney! Click on nay of the images or just go here: <url>’re due to ship in January - all the details are in our last update: <url>’re due to ship in late November - all the details are in our last monthly update on September 16: <url>’t wait to get one to you :) Hi guys, monthly update is a great idea! (sorry, thought we'd replied to this - sometimes commenting through the KS app doesn't work.) We're working on the next update now and will post in the next few days. We're still on target to deliver in Q4 as mentioned in our last update: <url>"we hope to get approval any day now" is correct and the next update is NOT "Apple want us to make some minor modifications to the App" With a projected ship date of seven months you have now almost doubled that. Really disappointing that this still has not yet shipped. I get that Kickstarter is not a store, but well over a year after funding makes me really question the integrity of the creators. The app design couldn't have been sent to apple in the last 14 months of waiting? Really hoping that the next update says shipped, not another excuse and delay. Were surveys sent for this? I never filled one out, and when I look at 'Surveys' under the 'Backed Projects' page, I see this: "The survey for this reward hasn't been sent by BleepBleeps yet." I can't imagine that you already delayed for over 6 months and now it's even more due approval from Apple. I don't have any background in projects but i would expect working on software in line with hardware. In addition you post this same picture of the warehouse where you holding your products on 12th November. Then are they ready or excuse with ITunes is cover story? (<url>"in a few weeks", anything more specific now that a few weeks have passed? Regards. Instagram link not working. Well it has been a year since the project was funded. Any update to when the Sammy's will finally start to ship. Any chance that you will get them out before the end of the month? I'm near to forget I bought this near two years ago. I had time to build a door alarm with arduino that message me if it opens <url>"no news, is good news". I would however like to get a conformation that this still holds true for this great project? @BleepsBleeps I will be moving in Aug. I have updated to my new address though Backerkit. Possible to ship it so that I will only receive after Mid Aug? My new place will not receive anything for me before I move in. Thanks! Looking forward to holding it in my hands... and hearing it scream!!! Please use a postal service like USPS and DHL, UPS or the like. And please declare it as a gift and not as merchandise. Your product is a reward for our pledges. And please attach that declaration/invoice at the outside of the package too. Thank you and good luck with production and distribution. Cu, Robert Looking forward to my award August 2014 - Red is a hot color! Keep up the good work. @BleepBleeps Thanks for the quick response! I'll look forward to the update :D Any updates on production or progress? Thanks! The link you posted for the basestation did nok work :( Congrats!! :D Congrats! Great job! Awesome, thank you! getting close to the stretch goal :D It would be nice if there was a level where for can get one of each of the colours... I am already signed up for the family pack. I agree with Kai.. get some last minute offers in there :P for us $55 backers I thought about rising my pledge for another Sammy Screamer but your 55,-$ offer is only interesting for Early Bird Kickstarters. If I rise my pledge of Twin Sammy Screamer with 55,-$ I will receive three of them for 180,-$. This is more than the Family Unit will cost. You should think about some other offers for your non Early Bird Kickstarters in the last hours if you want to reach the next stretch goal. Best wishes Would you consider making a base station that plugs dirrectly to a power source, that ultimately could connect over all you upcomming projects? And sends it to the phone via wifi?? Backer #1000 Would you post on your site a video with sound that offers us a sample of the sound the Sammy Screamer - Motion Alarm will make? Will we be able to choose from one sound verses another sound. Is the sound loud and disturbing? Or just email me the sample. In order API Pebble Mac/PC (Desktop app) iOS Bridge (Remote iOS device connects to local iOS device) API Raspberry PI Arduino SDK Sorry. I meant iphone App. Thank you 1. App feature: send email when an event occurs. Thank you 1. Pebble 2, IFTTT IFTTT is definitely a must-have Mac/PC, Pebble or IFTTT 1. Arduino 2. SDK 3. IFTTT 4. iOS Bridge I would love Bergcloud integration. 1. App feature: send email when an event occurs. I would connect Sammy to a spare iOS device at home. My main device, my phone, could receive the email notifications of motion events while I'm at work. This small feature would make Sammy long range. 2. IFTTT Hi, support for IFTTT would be really useful. Thanks Ability for Sammy to 'talk' to Arduino/Raspberry Pi that have BLE add-ons would be very good. IFTTT, Pebble &/or Mac would be great. Great to see a post about support for other services/platforms. The platform I'd like to suggest is node-red (<url>"unused" old smartphone. This smartphone is always within Sammy's range and will receive the initial alert, but then relays the message to me via email. I see it says you can adjust the volume on the app. Does that mean it can turn the volume down on the screamer or is it referring to the phone volume. Please please consider a simple "low tech"version of Sammy for those of us who don't have "smart devices" or would find it inconvenient to have to have a compatible app device to operate Sammy. There is a HUGE unmet need among caregivers of persons with Alzheimers and other forms of demential for a friendly device that alerts them if a patient or loved one has wandered out of their room or the building… particularly in the middle of the night… sometimes getting lost just trying to find the bathroom. While there are battery operated LED motion detector lights on the market, they don't give an audible alarm if someone has gotten out of bed. There are security door alarms - but they are extremely loud and may scare the beejeeezies out of an elder who is just trying to find the bathroom. The gentle bleep bleep of Sammy is so much more "friendly". Perhaps Sammy can have a companion "monitor" (like a baby monitor) so he can be heard by a caregiver in another room in the house or building. Perhaps Sammy can also have a companion LED motion sensitive light so the person can see there way without tripping at night (falling/tripping is one of the major safety hazards for elder Alzheimers/dementia patients!). But please - simple tech. Perhaps there can be different iterations of Sammy -- Sammy Jr/Sr or Sammy 1, 2, 3… at various price points? Is it possible to produce a Simple Sammy ASAP? Thank you for the opportunity to comment & provide input. Interesting point about the server app. Perhaps it comes down to offering a bleepbleeps API with some examples (arduino/sparkcore/raspberrypi/...) of how to create your own 'server' for pushing bleepbleeps data to addressable external services (Xively/bergcloud/opensense/..) WiFi is ok, but how could the bridge talk with the smartphone. This would need to configure a fixed ip in the bridge and add this ip to the smartphone app and this is not as easy as connecting sammy through bluetooth. There are only two techniques available to make it easy enough: a) Like Eye-Fi Card the bridge generates its own WiFi. This WiFi is only available if an alarm needs to be send (so the smartphone is only offline for a short period). This solution is very nice in theory, but as I'm having several Eye-Fi cards I know that the smartphone does not choose the new WiFi in any case. There would be a solution by scanning the wifi signals constantly, but this costs battery lifetime. b) Every Sammy has an ID and sends alarms to a gateway server hosted by BleepBleeps. The smartphone app checks constantly for new alarms at this gateway with this ID. This works without hassles, but costs money and maintenance time at BleepBleeps. I would prefer option B. But instead of creating a new hardware it would be better to create a "server app". This means a smartphone or tablet needs to be connected through bluetooth with sammy and forwards this information in a much more flexible way. e.g. by: 1.) Wifi/3G to the BleepBleeps gateway 2.) Wifi/3G to a cloud service (WebDAV, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) 2.) SMS 3.) email 4.) ??? As it is not expensive to buy a used android or rather most of the people have multiple devices this would be the easiest method. Hope you like it. Do like the idea of a BLE/Wifi bridge, I'm imagining it as a charging pad for the whole bleepbleeps family I agree with Christopher re a basic BLE/WiFi bridge add-on and was thinking along similar lines myself. Here's a suggestion. How about an add on device as a stretch which bridges from bluetooth to wifi. So you don't have to to change the core unit to handle wifi and the extra power requirements and could have a plug in device that Sammy talks to which then does the wifi alerting? Not sure if this is technically feasible but I guess you guys are the experts ... +1 wifi please. Alternate workaround. To send an email from app directly automatically when triggered +1 wifi pleaseeeeeee +1 on WiFi connectivity. Proposal: $100k target: built-in battery with usb charging. I hate coin batteries ;) Nice news on reaching 55K! Regarding additional stretch goals, if Sammy would be connectable to existing gateways (bergcloud for example) - I think it could be a real plus. Question will be how achievable that is within the existing footprint. Another, perhaps more accessible, stretch goal is the inclusion of additional attachment materials. (Add some Sugru+magnets, velcro or removable cable ties...) I like the red the most. Would be great to have a silver one, to match the colour of my car, which is where my Sammy would leave, to alert me if it ever gets stolen. Got my vote for wifi. This will be a great security device for hotel stays. Just in regard to the comments below, I 100% sure that I'll at least double my pledge for wifi functionality if there's going to be one. If you could further develop Sammy Screamer into wifi connectivity that will win over all security devices in the market. If we could use our phone to help setup internal wifi settings and by sending Push to phone, that will be way more better. I'm thinking that 50 meters are actually how far I could see. If this could make me know if my kids open the cupboards for games while I at work that would be fairly more useful than 50 meters. I understand wifi technology is battery drainer but this could be the future. Just to think about it if there's any chances we could get near that point. Love your product design by the way~ can't wait to get one. Very clever. I can think of a million places I could put these. I recognize the concern from other people, if it is only bluetooth, could it keep a notification in some sort of internal memory until your smart phone reconnects? Or WiFi…that would be ideal. Either way, I'm super excited to see this product. This is a very cute idea; I love it! I would like to know if it is waterproof and/or shockproof? Thanks! Can you tell us how loud Sammy can scream? Decibels? Comparison to something? A full volume video with no background music (and a warning message if necessary)? Blue or green! blue Can we have a stretch target for a wifi version? Or a web version, so connects via wifi to router and sends an alert to a web site which tracks or alerts? I'm sure people would increase pledges to get a wifi version if available. Black please! "If your phone goes out of range Sammy goes into standby automatically and the app lets you know." 1.) Scenario: For several seconds the smartphone looses connection to Sammy and exactly in this moment a motion alarm fires. What happens now? Was Sammy in standby or was he able to catch the motion because of a timeout? If yes, how long is it and am I able to change it through the app? 2.) How do I wake up Sammy if he is in standby? "You can override this in the app’s settings and keep Sammy armed when out of range but this is not recommended to protect battery life." 3.) Referring to the 1.) scenario: What happens here? Will the alarm delivered once the connection is established again? What if the next connection takes e.g. 20 minutes? Neutrals: black, gray and white Green and Blue!! Yellow please Green please GREAT JOB! I think the BEST colors would be Red and Yellow. Continued success. Hopefully, you will offer Sammies to your supporters at the end of the campaign. We've just passed the first stretch goal, congrats! Any thoughts on more stretch goals? Maybe a KS limited edition color? Very much looking forward to this product! Sammy, thanks so much for the answers in the faqs. I'm really looking forward to having you to protect us, you luscious little thing. Thank you for adding the target amount of the android app. I'm sure you will reach this target. I've raised my pledge to the family package ;) I think this Sammy screamer is a good idea, the design of a portable motion alarm that can alert you by phone is genius. but there a few things that need to be answer in order for this project to be fully realize (for example the app compatibility and the Bluetooth range), but right now I support this project. Worried regarding the bluetooth range - any chance of including WiFi aswell? WiFi direct e.t.c.? Awesome. Launch it now! (Father of a 6 week-old boy) First target is 20.000? This is confusing as in the details targets list ist only question mark. So nobody knows how much is needed to reach this target. Android please. And I am concerned with the volume of the beep sound. Please make it louder. No android, no pledge. I don't want to buy it today and wait 2 years until I'm able to use it. You should announce a release date. With my newborn son planning to create havoc around the house, I can't wait to test a Sammy Screamer out! Fingers crossed you guys smash you goal as the other BleepBleeps looks awesome too! Sammy would be classy in petroleum blue. But I quite like the available orange as well! Is the Bluetooth range 30 or 50 metres? BleepBleeps are awesome! Can't wait to get my hands on Sammy and the rest of the family. Good luck guys! Wow! I understand that Sammy is a product in its infancy, however I wonder if you could speak to battery type, ability to replace the battery, and I was going to ask about projected times for the battery's useful life, however I recognise that this would be dependent on a number of factors. This seems like a really neat product. Thanks!
