thank you so much!! im glad you liked it!! yes shipping has been slow, but slowly but surely more and more packages are going out!, a bunch more are going out on monday. :) anyway, i am happy you love it! Any updates? It has been 2 months and I am being patient but was wondering. Received our skein of Polwarth this afternoon. It's beautiful! Thank you for all you've done and been through. I'm proud to have been a small part of your venture. Be well.
