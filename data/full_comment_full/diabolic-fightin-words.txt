This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. @Scott Desmarais: Diabolickickstarter@gmail I emailed everyone based on package Email me with the package you backed in the subject so I know what folder it belongs in This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. @shannon hall: go check your email, that should put it in perspective for you @shannon hall: and like I said, email me.. "It's on your personal page" no actually it's not. @shannon hall: you're bugged out homie.. I'm reading the facebook messages to you as we speak, no address or sizes.. Emails are also no address no sizes.. Go look for yourself, your facebook is dead, go check and show me where your shipping info is @shannon hall:humility? Absolutely not homie.. You're the one who's popping without any provocation. This isn't handled thru facebook that's why there's an email. If you emailed your info it would be in the section allocated for $200 packages.. Money has been spent on the merch you're supposed to receive, packaging and the remainder is for shipping so there is no refund because it's already been spent on YOUR package, if you'd pr vide shipping info you'd receive it This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. @shannon hall:I have every message from you, not once did you mention size or address information..

How would you know if you received the package of you don't live at the address you provided?? You'd just rather troll the internet anonymously popping off like a sucker. @Bolic is lazy: see you around homie @Joe:wrong guy @Michael Huntly: Hey guys.. Sorry I didn't update you on the status of your stuff.. This week I'm finishing up inventory on everyone who didn't receive their packages. I have them all packed up ready to go, organizing the shipping info has been a MAJOR setback.. I appreciate your patience and I apologize for not updating you sooner. @Corey B:are you doing inventory for me? How do you what was shipped and what wasn't? There's 300 packages in total going out. I don't see 300 people on here. Don't make assumptions dumb ass This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. @Sonny D: I apologize for all delays. It's been a **** signing and packaging everything along with promo'ing the new record. Keep in mind, everyone on here is as much a part of this record as me. Bare with me, CDs are shipped this week, vinyl will be soon @Guy LoMeo: $45 package does get a download link.. CDs/shirts are shipping soon @ANTHONY GRAMAJO: No. I don't have it yet, vinyls Hitting in a couple weeks Thanks for the support everyone.. I truly appreciate it I cant tell you guys how appreciative I am for the support.. I'm truly lucky to have such solid bunch of real hiphop heads behind me. Thank you all for the support, let's keep the momentum going 5 years later, still nothing Are we going to receive The Disconnect? I sincerely hope that your rap career continues to never build any traction, and just becomes a distant memory of your past because youre too focused on your personal struggles in life. I hope they consume you and your son's lives because you are a bad person. The irony that you yell into a void about corrupt politicians who dont give a fuck about the rest of the world and yet you couldnt put out the packages promised for the people that supported you. I’ve never received any of my stuff and I gave $200. How do I get my money back? It will return to sender if you do ever send it, i live at a different address. So don't bother. A refund is all i want if you want to honour anything. Do people here still want their goods? Or think diaboloc will earn enough from his next album to honour the pledges? Lol think of it like a donation to a welfare agency. so what's next ? we will have the CD one day ? You better not be lying bolic big fan but you should understand why I talked trash it's been years and your barely updating us. No one will receive it he's trash, lair and thief ain't just a cd name! I haven't received my package, just remembered about the project today. I wonder what (if anything) is going on. Did anyone ever receive their packages? ? 1 Year since this was funded and nothing to show for it. Its sad really. To be fair, i've had problems with most independent rappers when it comes to buying from them directly. This is my first kickstarter for a rapper though and probably will be the last. I'll just wait till the project comes out or not to buy from Amazon like i normally do. No communication from Diabolic. You should be letting us in the loop at least once every month. Thats just courtesy man, nothing else. We supported you but see how that turned out. I just spoke to bolic. None of this is his fault. He is doin all this on his own now and we will get our merch. Just gotta be patient YO EVERYBODY. GET YOURSELVES A TWITTER ACCOUNT. TWEET @DIABOLIC. TWEET @WARHORSE RECORDS. Tweet @KICKSTARTER. PUT THEM **** ON BLAST 1 year since we all threw our hard earned dough down the drain for the liar and thief. Karma is a **** 1 year... *conscience; and no "once" in the first sentence. AutoCorrect got me, and I should proofread. So many lessons today! I've tried asking him about this on Twitter a couple of times -- the first was about once two months after the album was released, with the rest of the times being recent. The first time, he did reply, and said it would be delivered soon. The subsequent times I've asked (all politely and with no one else tagged in the message, so it couldn't be taken as me attempting to 'call him out' or anything) were ignored. I understand he's probably tired of being asked, but when the issue still exists... I can't complain too much because I only backed the physical release, and at least received the digital copy (early, even). I totally understand the anger of those who ordered more expensive packages, though. Given how long it's been and that there is no resolve in sight, it's probably best to just chalk it up as a loss and move on. He can rap his ass off, and I would have continued to purchase any project he released, but I can't in good conscious continue to support someone who takes advantage of their fans and then all but ignores their concerns, whether deliberately or not. I know he mentioned a new project a while back, and unless I misread, implied that it would somehow be used to make amends to those of us who never received our orders; but with no additional information being released about it, who knows if that will happen. I supposed we all should have listened to him when he named his first album. This is the last day i give a fuck about receiving anything. If diabolic you read this and don't have the full 200 package, at least post anything you do have to make up some package. I sent you a message with a new address. I have a re direction for a month still in place if you have already sent. Hopefully i have a hard copy of your album before the new one drops...ha if not, fuck you. Go kill yourself. RIP my money aka diabolic's money now too soon? RIP PH aka PumkinHead I haven't been on here or been focused on wether or not he's mailed anything yet since I was being understanding. Since I couldn't sleep, decided to log in and I see a lot of people still haven't gotten anything. Smh. I know you're busy, we all are, but um nvm....One year anniversary I guess. God Bless. This sucks cant believe its been so long!!! I dont think we are getting our goods Maybe we should all take him to court, the last people that said that on here made him mad and Bolic sent them there stuff maybe if we get enough comments about suing he will fucking send us our shit or give our money back. 200 bucks down the drain for a guy who don't care about his loyal fans. Diabolic, it is pathetic. I hold patience aye. I am understanding, i get being overwhelmed. However, this is the worst business deal i have ever been suckered into.... almost a year passed since i paid, still havent got shlt Still waiting as well Still waiting... " " Still waiting... Still waiting.... Still waiting.... I haven't received anything me and Bolic actually talked and he told me that we where waiting on the hoodies I got the 200 package. He said the hoodies came out fucked up so he had them redone and he also said the cassettes are taking forever. That was 3 months ago. But he did say that I (at least) will get a digital copy of his new album and that if there was room in the box a extra tee. Hopefully he comes thru on his side. Ps, he has my info so fuck off smart ass. We did (well at least I did), dont be a smartass I got my signed copy months ago. For those of you saying he doesn't care or didn't send it, he did. When it was time to give your info you idiots probably never responded to the email properly or didn't respond at all. My last post was over a month ago and still haven't received anything... I just seen a Facebook posts with a picture of the shirts. He's working on shipping them. Not speakin on behalf of Bolic but he is getting around sendin to shipping out the packages. I agree 8 months is a long time to be waiting but being an independent artist shit get constantly thrown in your face. He won't let ya's down as he's got his rep on the line. Hope everyone gets their packages soon. Peace, Richie... Lmao, Diabolic cussing and having a go at his fans because theyre unhappy with the fact that its taken nearly A YEAR and most backers still haven't recieved their packages. There are fans here that are still loyal to Bolic after all this and he doesn't care, he thinks he doesn't owe his fans anything. If he ever does post another update on the orders, he'll probably pull some "you don't know whats going on in my life and Ive been busy" bull, but still has the time to post pics of his widdle baby boy on instagram. I personally don't think I wouldve had a problem if he posted ONE update explaining that the amount of orders recieved is overwhelming and needs a few months to sort it all out, but he just gave up and ran with the money. I'll be torrenting every future album, and Ill tell my mates to do the same, If we're still listening that is. Also dont forget to uphold your pride by replying to me calling me a clown and a f*ggot because youre not happy with what you read haha. I think its time to start inquiring to kickstarter directly about this. Let all be real here, no one is getting anything they paid for. Ever. Fuck this bullshit we aren't getting shit. He's a liar and a thief. this should be considered fraud.. scamming your fans, low ball bullshit. Im in aussie too n nothin Still nothing for me. Anyone else in AUS that got theirs? Been done like a kipper!! Cant believe iv spent money on his albums even the new instrumental liar and a thief!! Maybe the name says it all... Still i hope i am proved wrong iv held in the frustration long enough and dont feel good trash talking i just want my merch or my money back!!!! Im going to assume hes not sending internationally. Another 14 days ~ <url>#26 lol? I figured he was going to sign with our names like was asked in the email, and on the actual CD over any of that available space cuz I personally like reading the liner notes but the ink blocks it now. Did he sign anybody else's name or just a number? @James Dawson: it'll take longer for overseas Australia, I'd wait another 2 weeks at least depending on Customs. Still nothing for me yet � Good to hear everyones gettin there packages!! Has any1 in australia got theres yet? Got mine thank you!! Received mine today as well, thanks....but get it together for the next one :P I got my CD package today, I'm more than happy! thanks :D There's a surefire way to squash the beef here: Anybody who already DID get their package, if you could please post here and include a link to an image sharing site such as imgur.com with a picture of your package and name used here in Kickstarter comments displayed somewhere in it. It's not that there's a reason to doubt you but given the scope of the situation, that's the only way I see right now to officially settle this and accurately determine and assess the situation. Diabolic, you could send an update to everyone (as you've been doing recently) asking for the same so every backer can see it. Let's see how many backers can exonerate your side. I'd say at least 3 would be a good start. @Aaron Adams: Dial down your hoover, I can hear it across the continent. Saying a few uncalled for cuss words and parroting what your idol JUST said doesn't make you street (Diabolic had just said he has no life but that comment got deleted by KS). I thought you were too cool to care about the loss anyways, what's up with you now? Btw genius, those ppl you're insulting are the reason you're even getting the package, POTENTIALLY. If you can't even see that, I'd be real surprised to see you comprehend rhymes beyond the surface level of just listening to the flow. In hindsight, it's insulting to me to even realize I shared a fanbase with such idiocy. @Aaron Adams, "these ****," ultimately motivated this bum to get off the couch and send this stuff out... if (and it's a BIG if) you get what you paid for, it will have been in large part, because of us... no thanks needed, I'm glad I could help. This will be my final comment. As I'm 110% finished with this nonsense. I had a few hours to kill, and I've done that. Anymore back and forth with this guy, that's obviously not going to "get it" will be pathetic on my part. I think I'll have better luck explaing how to perform brain surgery to a gold fish. It's been fun people... I just emailed you . Is there any way you can tell me if you've sent the package or not ? F*ck these **** . They have no life. This comment has been removed by Kickstarter.

Not trying to not get my shit lol This message boards is pure gold I sent it to the email you provided me diabolic. A simple error even though it wasn't mine is hardly grounds for insanity. Anyway. Said and done. I will leave you to completion of this aye. I shut my Facebook around a month ago. I did check my email, it is in the sent box. I can copy and paste but this is futile. You tagged me in a comment when i asked and put an email address. It is now what it is. I have sent you the details via message here just before. Can you confirm you have them. You do way too much popping yourself aye You have left this hanging for way too long. Now you want my details. It was on your personal page and you directed me to email there yeah. Yes, i have been offensive because you have been absolutely rude in your response to those who have a right to ask questions and a right to complain. I will message you my address and sizes again. Can i have the package tracked. This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. Check your email september 15th 2014. On Facebook you provided an email address. Subject: shipping info etc. One thing i am is efficient. Don't try to turn this into me as my error. I checked my emails. I am actually asked you on Facebook and you provided me the email of which i sent to you. I provided all that information. Would you like the initial email? Some humility would be nice. I want a refund anyway. I won't even bite around your insults. I just want my money back. I sent you a message with the details that amazon require. This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. Bolic can you give me a status updated? Do you have my info? Have your sent it or need to send it? This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. This comment has been removed by Kickstarter.

The other possibility is that you are not able to manage this. Incompetent i mean by that. Which in that case get some tips from Viper in distribution and building labels. War horse is name. It sure is not a competitive label. Maybe business 101 would help. Sure you could find it on you-tube or possibly think back to what your learnt beside some twisted self righteousness or absolute narcissism. This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. I will be giving him till the end of this month if nothing i will be contacting Amazon. Totally gutted about this.. just wanted the album. This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. @Glenn How did you do that, i payed through amazon too!! let me know man, i could do with the cash back to buy WuTang's new album and Ghostface. @diabolic I sent an email with my updated shipping information and never got a confirmation if it was ever received or if my package was going out. Should be from <email>. just seeing if it's all good. Yea no I agree with you guys, Im just saying that these kickstarter projects do take time. Its not like this is a first. @Glenn - What package did you order? And how did amazon give you your money back exactly? Do they deal with this kickstarter project somehow? Wish there was a way to get our money back. $200 down the drain. He's been sayin there being sent out this week since October There should be an option to get your money back, especially after 6 months of nothing. Is that possible? Because right now it feels like you got scammed for 235$. This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. @ Aaron Adams Well, aren't you the coolest backer on here! Asking for clarification and honesty on your pledged package, getting what you actually paid for, knowing the value of a dollar is "sparking shit" now? Damn, thanks for enlightening me son! You can justify your $250+ however you want, that doesn't excuse the terms of THIS transaction. Just cuz you're cool with getting walked all over and disrespected doesn't mean other people on here are pushovers. Especially by an artist doing this to his core group of fans and treating them like trash and acting like the very corporate system that he supposedly fights against in his lyrics. Bolic have you sent any $200 packages out yet? Hey man, I moved since I sent you my address. How do I get you the updated shipping info? One would think you wouldn't associate war horse records with this lol your knight is lame or didn't realise it lost itself in battle. Wow dudes are complaining about their 25 dollars they spent supporting Diabolic. I put over 250 dollars into this kickstarter package and although it is very frustrating, there's no reason to be sparking shit on here. I hope to see the package soon, but if not whatever. I've bootlegged enough hip hop over the years to make up for this loss. Diabolic, You absolutely did not handle this well. Lets assume you have a legitimate reason for all this (which i dont think you do at this point), all you had to do was communicate with these fans. These people that donated money to help you fund this are not just any kind of fans, the fact that you dont understand that is crazy in and of itself. You just slighted a lot of your core fans, you're literally left with not much at this point. I dont care whatever it was, all you had to do was say, i'm doing this, or that, or i'm going through this at this moment, or give me this length of time. No, we are not trolling the web and popping off, its called being a professional. If you want to be respected like a professional you have to be ready to act like one. Put yourselves in our positions bro. Lets assume you were playing us, did you know that if you communicated appropriately we would still think you have a legit reason for the delay? cmon man. Its been 6months. This is my FIRST post since then. I wanted to give you time. Anyway, whenever I get it then i get it i guess. God bless you man. This is my second backing on kickstarter... the last project I backed, I didn't receive my package for almost two years (I came on here drunk a couple months ago, and took a shot in the dark and messaged the people, POLITELY asking where my shit was, or for at least a bit of closure on what happened, and next thing I knew, I has a vinyl in the mail)! Point is, I'm personally not stressing this situation (I understand some of you threw down more than the $50 I did)... if I receive my vinyl, sweet! If not, I know not to do this again.... I'll still bump the music, though (that's right... I'll pirate the fuck out of your music, Bolic! Sorry n shit!).... I do see where a lot of people are coming from, and do agree that updates (at the very least) would be considerate, but it is what it is.... it'll sort itself out, or it won't.... one love and fuck you! I still haven't received my vinyl either... has it shipped? I don't mind waiting but I think at this point an update on the campaign is essential to let all of the people who supported the album know what the status is. The last update was at the end of October... what's been going on for the past two months? Will we be getting additional merch as a good faith gesture because of this wait? Still haven't received my package either. How do we get in contact with someone that can help What Packages were sent out i'm a signed cd package with stickers ? To stop a literal attack, you did respond to some people with broken promises. I find it interesting that the only people who are responded to are those who pass any judgement. They are responded to with vague threats and attempts at humiliation. You know what, it is despicable, your sense of entitlement and disregard of people who not only trusted in you but threw their money in. I do want a refund. But don't trust you will return the money either. It is worth 235 to see through an illusion. There is no excuse for this. None. Whinge all you like diabolic, you made the fucking offer. It isn't record companies stopping you. It is yourself. And yes, you have my address, i don't listen to you because i am afraid of you. What packages are you gonna send out this week ? Because I know how the mail works. I won't get deeper in to that because it would be a waste of time. If a couple months ago when I moved it actually seemed like you would ship out the package at some point, I would have told you the new address. Seemed obvious that wasn't going to happen though and still seems obvious. Also, I can see the countless other people below that have complained and asked questions with no responses. Just admit you screwed up and/or took the fans support for granted. The way you handled this is wrong. At least admit it to yourself. I'm not the only one that's said so. So instead of having hurt feelings when people call you on the bs way you've handled this, just admit it. At least to yourself. I'm done commenting now and done checking this page. This was my first and last kickstarter backing. But if you want to use some of that money all these people gave you to go see the new tenants at that house then enjoy. And if your feelings are hurt when people call you on your lies then that only proves what I was saying even more. But thanks for the only document of threats. No, you had my old address. Did you forget it has been 6 months since I backed this? Thanks for the reply. What packages is he talking about? The ones that haven't been sent yet are they the shirts/hoodies or the bundles knowing that would be nice since I payed 200 for stuff I haven't got yet. This dude is a joke. Wait months for what was promised or an update and then he responds with more of the same lies he's been feeding us. He's just lazy and a loser who isn't man enough to support his kid without begging, so he took his begging to kickstarter. Liar and a Thief was a good album. Fightin Words is weak. The fact that this guy took such a major step backwards in lyrical content combined with how he's screwing the little guy (his fans) also combined with the fact that he isn't bright enough to figure out how to ship items out makes me question how much of his lyrics on Liar and a Thief were really written by Immortal Technique. He's proving he isn't bright enough to even understand anything he was saying, let alone actually write it on his own. Dude complained about Technique not promoting him enough and how Viper screwed him. Here's an idea - Stop blaming others when the real problem is that you're just lazy. The way you have handled this kickstarter thing takes away all credibility you might have had and makes you look like a joke and a hypocrite. Think so, check out help at the bottom of the page. Can we complain to kickstarter? No reply's back this is looking bad :/ Hey Bolic. I funded you for 2 reasons, to help you get Fightin Words off the ground and to get my CD to listen to it. So far I have gotten 1 of those 2 things. We have been waiting a ridiculous amount of time to get what we funded for. If I knew it would have taken this long I would have never funded. 0/5 I don't even care anymore. There's no excuse for this. Everyone on here has been extraordinarily patient and I think I speak for many when I say that there was no rush for us to get our stuff. We understand he's busy and all that. There's stuff he has to take care of. That's fine but it does not take 3+ months to send out around a 100 signed CDs and 50-60 shirts/sweatshirts. I'm sorry but if I were in his position I would have had everyone sent out within a week or two. These are loyal supporters, not just willing to promote via word of mouth but going the extra mile in giving up their own money to support not just one artist but underground hip hop in general. I don't believe he has the intention of never sending anything; we will eventually get what we deserve. At this point it's about the principle of the situation. It's no longer really reasonable to think that the amount of time we've been waiting is acceptable. This is really unfortunately because I considered myself a top tier Diabolic fan. I listened to Liar & a Thief hundreds of times. I introduced my friends to him; I legitimately tried to help spread awareness but now I see that it was pointless if this is what I get in return. No whining on this side; this is the reality of the situation. He don't care he don't even check this if you go on his page he Hasn't been logged on since October. He took are money and ran with it. This the last time I support diabolic he lost a loyal fan to being shady and lazy. He's out there doing all kinds of other shit instead of worrying about his true fans who back this kickstart. This sucks id be happy if i knew what was going on is it shipped yet, where hasnt been sent to etc. we aint moaning we support Diabolic we wanna wear our new shit n spread the word in all corners! Just a bit of feed back n info would be sweet I'm in Canada and nothing yet. I'm in Cali and I haven't got nothing either I paid $200 for 3 months of nothing. I wish he was more straight up with us. VERY DISAPPOINTED! I'm in the UK and ain't had it yet :/ Very disappointed... I'm in NY and haven't gotten anything yet...maybe it shipped by pony express Anyone got there package outside of u.s yet? Not yet bro � anyone receive there package yet?? Hope my package is in the post! looking forward to seeing it.. Be so happy if my hoodie n cd are here this week!! Its about to hit crazy aussie summer iv prob got a week to wear my new hoodie. My favourite track would be feel ya pain! Seen on Facebook you have a bunch of orders going out. :-) Exactly. As long as I know it's coming then I'm cool. As I said before I'm very patient. All good! As long as I get the cd eventually, I dont care how long it takes. Big fan man, I've been listening to this album since the day it came out on Google music (I pay the $10.00 a month) I didn't even bother with the download and I'm not to worried about the CD. Basically I gave you $25.00 because I love your music and level of talent you bring. I want to let you know I have not bought a CD in YEARS! So me "buying" your CD should speak volumes. With that said, your reaction to peoples' comments on here are uncalled for, you should be more forthcoming with information, since really that is all they are asking for, and a lot less defensive and offensive. You have effectively alienated your most loyal of fans, when all they are asking for is more truthful information. If you need a few months, years, or decades just say it.. thats all man. Now with all of that said the album is fantastic, just about every track, besides a few towards the end lol those are so so, but still better than anything out right now. "Bare with me, CDs are shipped this week, vinyl will be soon." That was six weeks ago. My bad for not seeing the words "some of the" before "CDs." 6 weeks with no update since the last update that didn't come true is clearly wrong. I thought you were, in part, about questioning shit that is wrong and taking a stand. I guess I assumed that too. Tons of respect lost. Keep my CD. That's one less package to ship out. There's others on here complaining also and asking questions you haven't even answered. I'd rather be a jerk off than a dick rider any day. Saying shit is "shipped" and then having no update for 6 weeks when the shit wasn't shipped is wrong. Period. Hahhaha, the jerk off comeback cracked me up. That comment alone was worth the wait Been about 6 weeks since your last update saying they were shipped. That's the problem, not me. You can keep my cd I don't even care anymore. Or you could have not come on here saying shit is shipping "this week" and then again a few weeks later saying they are "shipped" and then people don't have a reason to question it in the first place. And come on man, everyone on here is someone who supports you and your music and wants you to be successful and continue to put out music. That's why we pay for CDs and merch rather than just downloading for free or getting free copies from friends. The amount of artists that I really support (buying CDs, merch, going to shows) isn't all that many anymore and you are one of them. People just want updates when it appears that shit is overdue. And it appears that way since you were on here saying they were shipped. If the estimated delivery date said January instead of September and if you hadn't been on here twice saying they were shipping that week, then I wouldn't have said anything. Don't lie and tell people they're shipping that week.. And then come back weeks later and lie again saying the same thing. And then disapeer for a few more weeks. When you set this up it says estimated delivery as September for all the packages, so with all of that you should probably be more understanding why person after person is coming on here wondering wtf is going on. I was patient and didn't say anything until the end of October. Sorry if I don't choose to ride your nuts like some of these other people and Im being too real here, but shirts and vinyl have nothing to do with the people that are only owed a cd and that's the majority of the packages. You're acting likes it's a big chore when you more than tripled your goal due to your supporters.... Should probably be thankful that people care rather than telling them to suck your dick because they're wondering why you came on here with false shipping dates multiple times. Im so disappointed i even upgraded my package cause i was buzzin for this album!! Our faith needs to be restored in quick time, get honest news on delivery or refund cause this shit aint fair especially to fans who scraped together there money to back the album Maybe he thinks stealing from his biggest supporters is a good plan. Has anyone received their package yet? Did we just get ripped off? Diabolic is one of my fav artists but really? I'd like to know what is going on. 200$ package, haven't received anything. Not located in the US. I'm from Scotland and haven't received my $25 package yet, how long will this take? anyone from the UK received there's ??? Any news on anything? Hope my hoodie n cd are on the way, everyday after work im excited to see if its finally here!! Has anyone in diff countries received there merch yet? I aint hating or nagging just want what i paid for, me being in australia i could be easily forgotten. Any feedback would be good A month and a half since the release date and I still don't have a CD. So, lets get real... I like good music, but I also prefer to like the person and that person's character. I package stuff to ship out six days a week by myself. Come on, its not that hard. Lets do the math - of 310 backers, 95 purchased only digital music, so you only have 215 packages to ship out. Of that 215, 130 of them is only a CD and stickers, which should take no more than 3 minutes each to sign and package (F it, send me an unsigned copy, at this point I don't care). The remaining 85 might take a little more time (I don't know or care enough to look at what was offered in those deals). The goal was more than tripled, you could pay someone $200 to package everything! Its a two day job at the most. Luckily for me, as a first time Kickstarter back, I only gave $25, so I guess I paid $25 for a digital copy. I can't believe nobody has mentioned this yet, so I will... Diabolic complains about labels, especially one in particular and complains about how that labeled screwed him. So he starts a Kickstarted campaign to raise money talking about "So I asked myself, how do I give them this better version of me? The answer is to let my supporters be my label." Really? So I guess its time for you to turn around and screw "your label" just like you complain about? Also, there was this gem on the cover page, "Let’s get something straight though, I’m not some charity case." Well, when you take the money and don't deliver on your promises, that is exactly what you look like. I feel the same way @Sonny D. I had mad empathy in the beginning and even got a friend to donate to bolic. At this point though, I wont even wear the shirt if it does come. We're 5 days shy of it being 3 months since the money was collected. The fact of the matter is that even with sending the shirts back they should have been done already. Whenever I think about this I hear his voice from the outro to Liar and a Thief and the end of My Attitude, which is pretty much fuck my fans. And that's exactly what the package symbolizes now. It was my decision to back but I feel like a sucker now and wont fall for this shit again. Going into this bolic was one of my favorite artists so maybe that's why I'm more tight than most. Oh and PS, i still NEVER received a DL link. Had to have my boy mentioned above send me his. This is my last time checking kickstarter I'm just cutting my losses and, as Vinnie P would say, keep it movin' on. @Sam, I'll believe it when I see it at this point, he's been saying "shipping soon/ this week" for over a month. I've been turned off to even listening to the digital album now. It had become a ritual where every time I checked my mailbox I'd actually exclaim "fucking Diabolic!" And I grew tired of doing that 2 weeks ago. For anyone wondering. He posted an update: <url>"support future bolic projects". Most of us are probably in the same socioeconomic situation as bolic, so he should understand our struggle as well, esp with money. I would have thought he'd be more forthcoming with what the deal is with the packages instead of just saying they're shipping soon. That was said on Sept 22 and its now a month later with zero updates. Yes vinyl's were not ready, but there was never a reason for why non vinyl packages were delayed. Its seems shady that 9+ grand was banked on top of the 4 grand and hes been ghost here pretty much ever since. Maybe I'm just crazy, maybe I'm just asshole, but hey, thats prob why i listen to bolic in the first place lol. Peace. I ain't got mine yet and i'm in the UK, messaged him on facebook and even sent emails but no reply. he could at least send us a message instead of just leaving us! Any update on shipping? I got the T-shirt package Anyone in the U.K received their signed hard copy yet? Yea to clarify I don't i'm not in a hurry either as I have the itunes album (bought that as well to support) and the DL link on CD in my car, I just want my signed actual CD for the car and a keepsake since it's another classic HIP HOP QUOTABLE GALORE album. And i want to make sure it wasn't sent out but I simply still didn't get it for whatever reason as I know you mentioned (two weeks ago tomm). Creator Diabolic on October 1 @Sonny D: I apologize for all delays. It's been a **** signing and packaging everything along with promo'ing the new record. Keep in mind, everyone on here is as much a part of this record as me. Bare with me, CDs are shipped this week, vinyl will be soon I purchased the $200 package. I understand that you have been busy promoting this album. I am in no hurry at all, I am just wondering if the packages are being sent out/have been sent out yet? Im in australia i got the $75 hoodie n signed copy, im in no hurry for it just dont wanna be forgotten cause im miles away! Bought the itunes copy best album pure fire!!!! I'm still waiting for my package too. And haven't actually received my package but I'm a patient man. Man, got the $45 package ($60 live in Canada) and didn't even get an album dl link. Dissapointing but I understand what Diabolic is going through. Of course I bought the album on iTunes but still.... Still no cd... @Diabolic Have you shipped those out yet and has anyone else on here gotten their signed CDs yet? If not not a big deal just wanted to know ETA b-c I'm on the lookout for it everyday in the mail. Bought the Itunes and have the MP3 from $25 package burned onto CD so i'm good having the CLASSIC music just want that signed CD for a keepsake! #HipHopQuotablesForDAYS I don't know what's going on with other backers as the last comment was Sept. 23 but here's my deal: Diabolic, we really need a (quick) status update. Being kept in the dark with no physical CD when it came out 2 weeks ago in retail is kinda not cool. I got the digital copy just fine on Sept. 14. You like being straight forward and direct in your rhymes and that's the same way I am as an individual. That's why I respect you, listen to you and the reason I backed you. My car only plays regular CD's and I've been itching to play this while driving. Thanks. Still waiting for my $75 package... hopefully not too long now. It's been almost a week now since the cd dropped an I still have yet to receive my autographed copy in the mail. I figured I would give it a few days before asking questions like everyone else but now I'm wondering when will I receive my copy of fighting words. Sad thing is I only live a few towns over from bolic so you would think it would have been delivered to my house fairly quick. On a good note I did get my dl link for the album but I'm still sitting over here waiting for my autographed copy. Bolic the album is pure fire I just wish I had my hard copy of the cd in my hand already! thanks for the update. I'll keep an eye on my email for the link. I still have not received a download link, the autographed CD or the T-shirt. Also, I have not received any emails regarding a tracking number or any indication that the package is on its way. There has not been much headway made in the area of customer service, at least publicly, as most of these comments asking similar questions are unanswered. I harbor no disrespect towards Diabolic, but if this happened on a purchase from amazon or ebay, I would already be asking for my money back. Who wants to spend $45 on a CD, just to have to listen to it on youtube? Diabolic, I never got my signed autographed copy... a couple weeks... that sucks. Has anyone recieved the Vinyl yet? Yeah I'm in the the same boat. No 45$ package and no DL link (I wasn't originally expecting a DL link but the email said I would get one). It's ironic, fund the project so it reaches the public and the public gets it hear the project first. I'm not hatin at all, just becoming less excited as the days go on. I only received the exclusive track download, but not the digital download or my 45$ package yet, if anyone is wondering about it as well. Yeah same here, still nothing. I got the email for the exclusive bonus track and the deluxe digital download of the album, but nothing else. I'm sure he'll get to us soon enough, though. I still haven't got any mailing info. I emailed diabolic and he said that I was the 2nd person with the $200 package to not get the mailing info. He told me he would send me the info again but I never got anything still and this was Sunday. Emailed him again yesterday and haven't got a response. I thought it was just me, I haven't gotten an email for the address or size info either, only for the exclusive track, which is fire. Hopefully those of us who haven't gotten that email get it by tomorrow or Monday. Sittin in Aus waiting for the deluxe album download! Thanks Jacob but I checked my spam and everything and no luck. Check your junk mail joe I thought same thing but it was in junk. Patiently waiting for link to deluxe album! I got the song only but not the email for the mailing info. Any one else having this issue? Got the e-mail last night for the address. The digital version will be sent to the email you signed up with has anyone received the august unreleased Diabolic track? by chance? and when shall we expect the emails for the delivery of the autograph album? Diabolic did an interview on "Conspiracy Worldwide Radio" (which is a great hip hop show in UK that interviews and plays a ton of dope, usually SleptOn HipHop) where he said he was working on all of this behind the scenes in terms of addresses, shipping, etc. Said it was a little overwhelming/annoying (in an understandable way bc of all the support not in a bitter way) but that it would get done! Let us know if we can help with addresses Bolic! Can't wait! New track with Primo and RA that dropped are flames! Anyone get an email from him asking for sizes or mailing address yet? It's getting pretty close to release. Just curious. I've still got nothing except the initial confirmation email that the project was funded. I see there's 3 tracks already available on iTunes for purchase... are we going to get download links? It'd be nice to not have to pay twice for those. Great question. Can you clarify Bolic? I would ask him on FB/twitter as well. I think they may ask for it once the 9/16 release date gets closer Anyone know how he gets our address to sent items too? i payed with my Amazon account and i wanted to know if it comes to that address? Album is gonna be sick. Diabolic is one of the best lyricists in the game. Music has gotten me through a lot of shit in life so it feels good to give back to people I admire and respect. Congrats Diabolic! Proud to be part of your 310 backers. Looking forward to the album ! #backingstraightfrombelgium Good job Sean keep making fans by making music awesome job God bless you shut up and take my money Can't wait for the signed vinyl had to treat myself to a tshirt and a signed physical copy, your last album was fire, can't wait until the next one, proud to be backing your project, if ihad the money I would have got you to spit fire on a track i make in the future, maybe next time. Keep up the great work and come England one day, peace! Just jumped up from $10 to $25 as I must have a signed copy of this back to back classic underground hip hop album from you! Patiently waiting. Let's get this to 12k everyone! This user's account has been deleted. Pledged $25.00 wish I had more. You're an amazing artist man, keep doing what you're doing. I haven't bought a CD, in years, choosing Google music over albums. But your incredible and absolutely deserve the recognition. Looking forward to the new album. I have made sure the money is in. So not secretly stoked to see you over 10 grand and can't wait to receive and hear your new album can't wait! I backed you up big dog. I've been waiting forever for you to resurface. Fighting Words is going be EPIC !!!! Cant wait!!!! Backed you brother $25 can't wait till the new album, I'm getting exited!!! Incredibly stoked for this album, thanks for keeping up and dropping mad songs. Got paid, so I finally was able to back this shit! Cant fuckin wait! Can't wait to hear this album. If "mission statement" was any indication of how amazing this album will be it was worth the wait. I don't expect we'll be waiting as long next time though. Keep doin' your thing man. We need more real lyricist's in the game who have your energy with creativity. First time i heard Liar & a Thief, I asked where the FUCK has this dude been? nobody knew. Well, i'm glad I found you. I know we won't be disappointed . 235 bucks is a lot to dish out for this but I feel obligated to after listening to your music for over a decade now (since hearing the Triple Optix EP around roughly 2003) Done! Can't wait for this album to be in my hands! I still bump Liar & a thief daily! Thanks for the best Hip-Hop out right now. Sup Bolic. Cant wait to hear Fighting Words! If you want free promo on the album and some new threads hit up @BOWClothing and @ParkStreetPR. Were big fans and its the least we can do. What's up Bolic lookin forward to this one, I couldn't look myself in a mirror and call myself a true head if I didn't back you (I didn't see any option for sizes on the Tee and Hoody is XXL available?) Respect from the UK bro Hell yeah! You got it homie! Props Bolic. I'm sure u will but let your fans know to keep contributing! No reason you shouldn't be able to Match anthother favorite MC of mine Elzhi who had it at 20k and 8 months later is at 37,382! No reason with your fan base and support in the underground you can't break 15k if not 25k! Hell $10 each from only 10% of your twitter followers is $16,000 alone! SUPPORT this man! His bars/kids deserve it! Congrats on reaching your goal. Your fans have your back and I'm sure you'll end up doubling up even tripling by the time funding ends. After looking at Elzhi's was 20k and is now at almost 38k so i guess it's allowed to go over after you reach your 4k goal so nevermind Just supported and implored my fellow hip hop heads to do the same thing. Wrote this on FB as well, do you not think 4k is selling yourself a little short? Hell you have 24 days to go and are already at almost $2500. I know you said you didn't want to feel like you were being charitable, but fans of yours and other slept on dope MCs all over the US believe it's worth it. Hell if ppl are going to support your album anyways it's a steal. I just feel like you could of did 8k or 16k hell even 20k and it would of succeeded. I have an almost 11 month baby girl and I know you have 2 young ones so you gotta feed your kids! Does KICKSTARTER allow you to change it to 8k or 12k for example if you get to 4k much quicker than you thought you would? Can't wait for this album. My 2 favorite MCs of recent times (You and Elzhi) both dropping their 2nd solo LPs later this year and both used KickStarter as a tool. Real dope! Fuck you U FAT fucking asshole! good luck! if u send me anything signed i will piss on it! god damn i have known u too long. your welcome for the support. u don't need it thats for sure, your work speaks for its self! see u in NY dick bag! one love Thank you for giving your fans the opportunity to be part of your project. And I gladly support it., much love and respect 'Bolic. Fightin Words! ur the best bro! keep doing what ur doing!! we will always keep supporting ;)
