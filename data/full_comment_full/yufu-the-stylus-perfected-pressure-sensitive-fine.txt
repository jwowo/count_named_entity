You are wrong IanR. The images you're referring to were rendered for packaging purposes only. The images you would find in the dropbox link below are of very real pre-production samples, which were made using the final tools at the factory. All of the images shared in an update last year were also of the actual items. All of the images on the website are also of the actual items. Check the EXIF data on the photos if you like: <url>"draw this project out", "Keep this rolling", "Smoke and mirrors" - in the context of a KS project - these things have no meaning. The funds raised have all been used - on the project and nothing else. You keep saying that you have no hopes of this project at all, so I question why you are even here... I've just reviewed all your comments - you've called me a fraud 9 times, a conman 4 times, scam/scammer 9 times, fraudulent 9 times, etc. You've made 69 comments - all of them derogatory, nearly all of them defamatory. So in my view you don't deserve a reward. You will need to visit a lawyer eventually, so maybe do that now - ask them if you can post whatever you like about someone online! Bear in mind that in defamation actions *you* would need to *prove* the truthfulness of a comment if you want to rely on that defence. Jason, since you have so far declined the terms of my offer for a refund, and you don't deserve a reward - you will *never* ever receive anything from me, so you are wasting your time here. I see little point in replying to you again. Ah... the Greek Chorus! James and Jason. Such earth shatteringly valuable comments. But the same question for you - why do you feel the need to come here and comment at all, what does it achieve? Here's an interesting article I read. <url>’s built on the continuum of inclusion and exclusion. This creates a set of common behavior patterns. First, members of a group lavish one another with praise so that they themselves might be accepted and praised in turn. Second, there are nonetheless enforcers within the group who build their personal power and reputation by policing the group and condemning those who break the group code. Social media can be vicious to those who don’t fit in. Twitter can erupt in instant ridicule for anyone who stumbles. Third, people are extremely anxious that their group might be condemned or denigrated. They demand instant respect and recognition for their group. They feel some moral wrong has been perpetrated when their group has been disrespected, and react with the most violent intensity. Crouch describes how video gamers viciously went after journalists, mostly women, who had criticized the misogyny of their games. Campus controversies get so hot so fast because even a minor slight to a group is perceived as a basic identity threat. The ultimate sin today, Crouch argues, is to criticize a group, especially on moral grounds. Talk of good and bad has to defer to talk about respect and recognition. Crouch writes, “Talk of right and wrong is troubling when it is accompanied by seeming indifference to the experience of shame that accompanies judgments of ‘immorality.’” He notes that this shame culture is different from the traditional shame cultures, the ones in Asia, for example. In traditional shame cultures the opposite of shame was honor or “face” — being known as a dignified and upstanding citizen. In the new shame culture, the opposite of shame is celebrity — to be attention-grabbing and aggressively unique on some media platform. Hi Robin, Great to hear from you - I wondered where you had got to! I'd missed the ever-so-serious dumbfounded* face staring into the bright light that is your profile photo... Thanks for the character assassination too, now a question about you - why do you feel the need to come here and call me a moron? What does it achieve? (*dimwitted also springs to mind) Apparently your grasp of written English is lacking? Obviously I care very much about the defamatory crap that you are posting. Most people would understand that the sentence "I don't care if you *think* you have a right to post whatever you want" comes with the implied ending "you don't". Defamation laws are different all over the world, and by "publishing" the comments that you have, you are liable for any damage caused by those words. WTF makes you think that you can post such derogatory things with impunity? Jon <url>"your money". As I posted here in September, the funds from YuFu project have been expended on the project and nothing else. To put your startlingly stupid analysis in simple terms. I have $100 in the bank. My friend deposits another $100 on condition that I use it to develop a product. I spend $100 on groceries and then pay $100 to an engineer. Applying your logic, you imply that I have misappropriated $100. That would make you a small minded moron. As I also said back in September, to that date, the cost to develop the software, the hardware and the industrial design for the project had been considerably more than the funds raised here. The completion of this project was always dependent on extra funding from me and by necessity, since mid 2014, I needed to apply my own funds that I had allocated to other things. So, if this project was to be completed at all depended entirely on whether I was able to raise more funds elsewhere - the pinheaded dimwits who have been tearing me down here for the last year based on a bullshit article about a groundless legal case have reduced the likelihood of the latter. I'm now exploring other options and will see how that pans out in the next month or two. I don't care if you *think* you have a right to post whatever you want. If on the one hand you want a project completed or refunded, and on the other you continually post spiteful crap; then you need your head examined. In any case, WTF makes you think you can post such derogatory things with impunity? You aren't anonymous, my lawyers know who you are and where you live. We are in discussion with KS regarding the defamatory comments on this forum. You better hope those discussions are fruitful, because if not - you are going to be held personally responsible for every word you have written. Jon <url>"wow, just wow", usually this is followed by the "can you believe this guy" stanza, and quite often ending in a long winded uninteresting diatribe telling me what I *must* do immediately. For what its worth... I've done a thorough audit of my emails with James from Procreate and I see nothing that should have precipitated their response. Perhaps Tasmanians think differently? I will refrain from releasing all of the emails between James and myself which would settle the matter, at least until I have legal advice. Many of *our* emails were ignored or went weeks to months between answers, if they got answered at all. Phone calls and Skype IM's were never answered or replied to. In contrast I have answered all emails from them, most recently in early August I said that the earliest we'd be able to support JaJa for iOS9 was with our next update which we couldn't complete before October. The Procreate comment in the latest iOS9 update is just churlish and ill considered (on many levels) but that's their choice. To state the obvious, they are removing support for a stylus with many 10's of 1,000's of users... i.e. they are harming their customers and seem to be celebrating that fact in the update text - weird! We don't sell the JaJa any more except for spare parts... Never-the-less, I had already committed to updating the SDK, and they weren't happy with that answer for some unknown reason. @Jeff, as I said - if you are a Procreate customer, complain to them - not me - it's beyond my control, and from the perspective of our worldwide mass market sales there are a lot of other important Apps. Procreate isn't that well known in the mass market. Hi All, Firstly, the YuFu project is very much alive. Secondly, regarding the procreate decision: whilst it's disappointing for you, it is not the end of the world - there are loads of Apps on the Appstore and the YuFu will work with Windows and Android. After reviewing my emails back and forth with Procreate, I found the tone of the Procreate comments to be more than a little surprising. The Procreate decision is ultimately going to impact their customers (you), and that is their choice - if you are not happy about that, discuss it with them - or find a different App. The YuFu is still very much going into production, although I'm waiting on a couple of things to align before I will proceed further (quote negotiations, lead times and so forth). So far, the expenditure on the development of the software, hardware and industrial design for the project is considerably over the funds raised here, but at this stage I intend to use my own resources to fund production. Just like many of you, I am keen to see the Apple Pencil, and if the iPad Pro allows us extra opportunity. With the release of that device imminent, it's going to be interesting to confirm that the YuFu will work on the screen. Obviously the iPad Pro tech could appear in future iPads of smaller size, and it's usually only a small tweak to make sure the electronics can be adapted for new screens Finally, I find little utility in posting updates or commenting here, it just unleashes a firestorm of negativity and abuse. If we can go a week or two without the hate, I might revise my thinking. However, I give the naysayers about an hour before I hear that's it's all my own doing, I brought it upon myself etc etc... <url>~$15,000, it's still earning reasonable income with very little work done since it launched in 2009... surprisingly, I don't regret launching it. @Virgil, it's people like you that make this all worthwhile. I apologise if you think this is some sort of shop where I have a big pile of stock out the back and I'm just keeping it from you for fun. I also note you live in the UK, go and watch the cricket or something. No @James, clearly you have some problems understanding the written word. Aren't you the guy who was going to charge the sale back with your bank? Why are you still here? The comment I made in the update was directed at people who either make, or repeat false, slanderous claims - I will be following up in due course. Particularly when those claims were made with intent to cause financial or personal damage. Read that text over next to the text entry box. -----> It's not hard - keep your negativity to yourself, it's pointless. Terence - if you are trying to compete with Charmianne for inane and superfluous comments, you have a long way to go. I'll give you some credit though - you are hitting the right tones with your banality. Charmianne - you have now made 141 negative comments - great work. Thanks for your input @barrett - please explain why you think it would be helpful? What would it achieve? Thanks @Barrett - Please stop trying to be a thorn in my side - It wont work. Not surprisingly, I have my own views on what is best for me and my company. I have no intention of changing my mind - my rules have stood since 2012, I've personally backed 63 projects and never demanded anything of creators. I've now wasted a couple of hours on this forum rather than doing something productive. So, if you want me to keep wasting time here, keep posting your essays - otherwise please leave me alone to get on with my work. Let me re-iterate what my rules are, since you might not have been listening: 1. I will do updates when there is sufficient information to justify one. 2. I won't do "heartbeat" updates - that is just dumb. 3. I am working on this and other projects, yes - they are taking longer than expected, I do not intend to share anything at all further about delays at this time. Except to say... 4. There are a lot of patents in this area of work and we need to make sure we work through any conflicts. (Patent problems have been the major reason for the delay - our electronics were ready a year ago, but we needed to redesign - I am not going to go into this further publicly) 5. etc below YuFu Pro Stylus www.yufustylus.com is the world's best pressure sensitive stylus.

The YuFu is available for pre-order at www.yufustylus.com Congratulations Charmianne 132 comments - more than 10%. Oh, and you worked out how to use google translate, good for you. @JK - I am not sure why you feel a need to "get it". Never-the-less, as I have spelled out before - here is the situation: 1. We had a design complete and working that relied on a particular method. 2. We could not implement that method. 3. We pursued another method which included a lot of material research - I don't want to share any of this information, nor am I obliged to. 4. The YuFu is shipping soon and you will get your reward. 5. I am working on it and have enough motivation to complete the project without being harangued and abused by people from the comfort of their arm chair. 6. There are very few people I have contempt for, I get disagreeable when I am personally abused or accused - when I am simply working on making a device that works how people expect. Most of the 1,261 comments below are from a small group of people - for example Charmianne has made 131 comments <url>"heartbeat" updates - that is just dumb. 3. I am working on this and other projects, yes - they are taking longer than expected, I do not intend to share anything at all further about delays at this time. Except to say... 4. There are a lot of patents in this area of work and we need to make sure we work through any conflicts. (Patent problems have been the major reason for the delay - our electronics were ready a year ago, but we needed to redesign - I am not going to go into this further publicly) 5. The follow-up emails sent to previous backers are offering kickstarter prices, if you choose not to purchase more product that is fine - remove yourself from the list! Each email has a link at the bottom - it isn't difficult to unsubscribe. 6. Some of you people need to get a grip and calm down - the average reward is $40, to bring the YuFu to market will cost me a LOT more than what was raised here - if you think this is a way to make money you should wake up. Kickstarter prices are below cost price. Just the SDK development costs around $50K. 7. I have every right to defend myself if people are being obnoxious and defaming me or my company. I will be dealing with defamation actions and seeking significant damages in due course - there is a lot of malicious intent with many of the comments. This forum is read in the UK, my company has a presence in the UK - <url>"We needed to lock down .... holds the PCB." That's fairly clear I think? -------------------------------------------------------------- Pressure Sensitive Stylus for iPad, Android and Windows tablets: www.yufustylus.com Bluetooth Weather Station: www.stormtag.co Connected Alarm Clock: www.aclock.co Charmianne, Stop being a troll - read the update. -------------------------------------------------------------- Pressure Sensitive Stylus for iPad, Android and Windows tablets: www.yufustylus.com Bluetooth Weather Station: www.stormtag.co Connected Alarm Clock: www.aclock.co Charmianne - that is answered in the update.

The workings of a product like this are damn close to witchcraft and it can't be demoed in a half done state. -------------------------------------------------------------- Pressure Sensitive Stylus for iPad, Android and Windows tablets: www.yufustylus.com Bluetooth Weather Station: www.stormtag.co Connected Alarm Clock: www.aclock.co Charmianne. I did that already. As I've said a lot of times - I will do updates when there is relevant information for all backers. As for "trawling through the comments", you've posted 115 of the 1013 comments... We have the T1 prototypes coming out from the factory - they left China yesterday. After we have checked them we'll hopefully get into full production of the basic YuFu. Unfortunately there are still some things to sort out with the electronics. Apologies for the apparent glacial pace of this project - there are a few reasons, but I will not be elaborating on them due to terms of NDA and licensing agreements. Paul - those libellous claims have been posted before and are completely false. To answer some questions from earlier - yes the fine point electronics work on iPad Air 2. I have been waiting on a revised board before doing an update - clearly we have had some technical difficulties and marketing/packaging material is ahead of production. When you see the electronics and how small everything is you might understand the delays. I can assure everyone that we're still working hard on this product, I have spent a lot of money building it, but still have sufficient to deliver it to everyone. Yes it's late, but it will be delivered. By repeating libellous or slanderous claims (defamation in USA), you are a party. We have your address, so - as I said we'll be in touch directly. I can accept copping some flack for late delivery, I can also put up with receiving advice from people who have never started a business, built a product or developed anything. But I will not put up with slander, your comments can be viewed in the UK where we have business interests, take a look at the laws there. That's pretty out of line Woo. A lot of libellous false claims there, so we'll be in touch with you directly. Robin, from memory you were charging back your transaction and were no longer a backer? You are the only person I've been intentionally rude to - but you know... you deserve it - seriously look at the never ending string of negativity and comments trying to stir up dissent: <url>"discrepancy". @Jason - read the update, I am not sure I can say it any other way. I will not be providing an exact date until it ships. Nor will I be answering any further questions on the matter. The update I provided today is substantial. That is all. @Jason - I think it would be best if you read the update and understand why the battery plan was changed. It isn't a design "flaw" until a product is manufactured. It's a design challenge which has been rectified prior to production. @Kurt - I will not be providing an exact date until it ships. I provided a progress update today that shows we are progressing. I'll provide another update in due course. @Arning - there are some important adjustments to parts that make the battery and tips work - these are the same parts in the Pro and the Note. If I released the Note early the replacement tips might not fit, so it is better to make sure everything is compatible. @Jeeb - thanks! That is my aim. @Robin - In case you hadn't realised it, I merely replied to your comment with the identical phraseology that you threw at me. In one breath you say my update is pointless, the next you call me a clown. You try and claim I am disgustingly rude? Seriously? What makes you think you are entitled to any better treatment than I am?? All of your comments to me and other creators have the same entitled, aggressive, negative tone and a waste of perfectly good pixels. @Charmianne - packaging is needed to protect the product, and it will ship in retail packaging with instructions barcode and all the rest. @Yu - I'll announce a shipping date when it is actually shipping and not before. @Tim - as you probably realise, most of the parts of the "YuFu Note" are the same as the other models, it just doesn't have the pcb. Those parts will all be manufactured together and are interchangeable. @Christopher - if anyone is being arrogant it isn't me... demanding a shipping date will not speed up delivery, I can't provide one until I am happy with the quality and functionality of the YuFu. @Second Guess - please don't :-) Robin, you've made another pointless comment. Seems like you make a habit of it: <url>"caught my ire". I'm simply not going to send product to someone who shows a *propensity* to chargeback. What's more if you think making threats of a chargeback is a good way to get a response - you are aren't thinking clearly. @Charmianne - It's very clear that the last few days "heat" has been caused by other styluses coming to market, I do admit that another update is overdue. I also thought it might be useful to comment publicly on how the YuFu differs from recently announced competitors products. I can assure you that the final product will be worth the wait! As you know, I have added a few features since first launching the campaign. YuFu will now ship with an *interchangeable* rechargeable battery - which you will get for no extra cost as a thank you for your patience. NONE of the added features have delayed the delivery schedule. More details on the battery plan in due course. SO the YuFu now has the following features which *no other stylus has*: - 1.9mm fine point tip - Pressure sensitivity in the tip for sketching and drawing - Pressure sensitivity in separate sensor in the grip which give pressure sensitivity with brush tips and as an option to tip pressure, for greater control - These two sensors also allow for opacity in the grip and line weight in the tip (if apps support this) - Interchangeable rechargeable battery - the batteries are charged by USB, but you can carry multiple batteries and snap them on if one runs flat. - cap to protect the tip from damage (a damaged tip will damage your screen) - cap protects the power switch to prevent accidental switch on in your bag - carry case - tilt, gyro, compass, accelerometer to allow for calligraphy, tilt sensitivity, and true palm rejection - we are also working on tip hover algorithms to show a hovering cursor without the tip touching the screen. The YuFu works with iOS, Windows 8.1 and Android 4.3 and will work with all Apps in fine point mode. Pressure sensitivity, palm rejection increased accuracy etc will work with integrated Apps. Thanks very much for your patience and understanding while we build the best stylus possible Get a grip folks. The last update was about 3 weeks ago, the next one will be soon. Some things take time, and this is one of them. Quite frankly it's clear that several of you think that you bought something from Amazon! Kickstarter is somewhere to back projects that you are excited about and when they are ready to ship you get one of the first in the world, in return you get a discount on eventual retail and you help bring something cool to market. It's also VERY clear that in the last 2 days a lot of people have seen the Wacom stylus and decided to get on here and demand a refund, so I thought it might be useful to clarify a few things for those people. 1. There will not be any refunds. As I have said - the project is underway and the funds you pledged are a commitment, in return I made a commitment to ship a reward to you when it was ready. 2. Yes there have been some delays which will result in late delivery - this doesn't change the commitment I mentioned in (1) 3. Rudeness, inappropriate language and other troll like behaviour will get you nowhere - but as a few particularly special individuals have learned there can be other consequences. 4. I CANNOT speed up manufacture, so please stop asking for me to do so - I'm working as fast as possible - is there seriously anyone who thinks I am delaying this deliberately - I have some large pending orders here and these delays are painful!!! 5. I'm not going give a date until it actually ships from our warehouse, so please stop asking for one. It might help the more impatient amongst you to just forget about it until the box gets delivered - that's what I do, with the 63 projects I have backed. It's kinda cool when a new toy gets delivered. Of course this comment will ignite another round of comments from the usual people who will say I am being arrogant, rude, condescending and there will even be one or two who say "how dare he suggest we just forget about it until it gets delivered" To those people I say, sorry in advance, I'm sure you will get over it - to everyone else, including all the private messages of support, thanks! Russ, I don't think you can claim to speak for anyone but yourself. Never-the-less, I am not acting superior to anyone. Really we could go back and forth for hours, but since you called me an asshole in your first ever comment, I might decline. Russ, thanks for your thoughtful comment, you've made the internet a better place... Wrong on all counts Jason, The last update was ~3 weeks ago, there a blog post at HEX3.co from the same day. I'll do the next update when there is something to update. If you read the comments below, it seems very much to me about people wanting a refund to go buy a new product from a competitor. I know you are new here, so I might remind you that this isn't a shop - you backed a product/project - you didn't buy something off the shelf... While you are reading the update here: <url>#comments take a sec to read the mature patient comments. Folks, please give the refund advice a rest. The way Kickstarter works is that backers decide to back a project and then see it through to completion. Just because some other shiny product has come along doesn't change things. Yes, there have been some unforeseen delays, but no - you will not get a refund. From my point of view we are working as fast as possible to get a fairly complex product to market. The backer funds are used and committed to do that, it simply isn't possible to refund a portion of these funds, it would jeopardise delivery for everyone. I appreciate the patience of the vast majority... @William - not much I can do there really except let the YuFu speak when it ships... For example one of the main complainants on that board is a lady from the UK (Leanna ) who felt aggrieved when UK customs charged her VAT upon import - she demanded we refund her the import tax or she would start posting bad reviews... Since then she has had a vendetta, and made all sorts slanderous claims against me and the JaJa. Posting literally hundreds of comments across Amazon, Youtube and Procreate... I have had about enough of her though, and I am considering options. @Charmianne - early on I made several comments about the DotPen, I won't make any more. Needless to say the YuFu will be significantly better due to how it works with it's Bluetooth/sensors that I mentioned below. @Charmianne - I am not sure which iPad you have. Procreate has won a couple of awards from Apple though. It's lightning fast on all of the iPads I have here... If you just installed it perhaps restart the iPad? @Charmianne - Try drawing a small circle slowly, or a slow diagonal line - I have tested a truglide here and it has exactly the same problems as all other generation 1 fine tip styluses. The lines are wavy and the line is offset when drawing on an angle. The YuFu is a vast improvement over anything available - firstly we have some new tech that prevents offset found in a lot of fine point styluses - near the edge of the screen offset becomes an issue. The cause is that the screen sensors are tricked by normal fine point styluses when they move between the 4mm x 4mm grid found on the screen, and the position info jumps from one sensor to the next. The onboard YuFu gyro and accelerometer sensors allow the App to know when you are drawing a straight line when the sensors on the iPad screen are being tricked into thinking a wavy line is being drawn. The YuFu has both a gyro and accelerometer so even when you are drawing whilst in an accelerating vehicle the line is rock solid. There is no latency from any stylus - styluses emulate a finger. What you are seeing is lag in the drawing engines of those Apps - try Procreate to see the lowest lag of any App - they use the full graphics processing capability of the iPad. Lag is normally hidden by the finger tip or a fat stylus tip and not all Apps perform perfectly. Bluetooth doesn't convey the positional data to the tablet, so there is no lag in line drawing caused by Bluetooth - in fact even our JaJa doesn't have any pressure sensing lag either and it uses high frequency sound... Data transfer speed of the information from Bluetooth is a tiny fraction of the refresh rate for your screen. So any data from the stylus will be transferred and processed a lot faster than the next frame can be drawn on screen. What is more - the data that we do convey over Bluetooth is for palm rejection and pressure info. Tip pressure sensitivity and grip pressure enable line density and thickness, whilst the tilt sensitivity, compass bearing, gyro and accelerometer will enable the palm rejection, and line thickness in some calligraphy style Apps. The stylus you mention has none of these features. From our huge array of sensors we'll potentially also have "cursor hover" if we can get it to work in some Apps it will enable air brushing above the surface for example - we are still experimenting with this, and it might come in a firmware/sdk update. Finally we have some cool new electronics that will automatically enable the fine point to work on any tablet with any screen protector, with no manual adjustment - our App will handle any tweaks required and update the firmware. Most other styluses will only work on a few devices since they all have different screen properties - for example I've tested and found different screen results between an iPad Air sold in Asia compared to one sold in Australia @Karl... you feel insulted? @Adrian feels insulted? Really? Please stop reading the comments section - maybe you have been reading some of the language that has been hurled at me..! Sorry - I have nothing further to add here. I'll do an update when we have some news - play amongst yourselves. @Adrian - please get a grip. Where have I insulted anyone?! I am not exactly sure what you trying to achieve with your comment - or is it just a general gripe trying to inflame opinion? Hi all, Some great and exciting developments happening with YuFu which I will cover in the next update. Please read the latest update if you missed it - it was 8 days ago. @Idontexist - I'm sorry, there are no refunds - we will deliver a great product to you. I'm pretty sure I answered your question a while back. I think that it's fair to say that there are two groups of backers: 1. There are almost 2000 backers who are willing to wait patiently for a great product, 20-30 of whom have offered words of encouragement and commented below that they would prefer to wait for something awesome. (thanks - I'm doing my best! :-). 2. There is a 5-6 person vocal minority who would prefer me to ship something *immediately* whether it works or not... or something. I'm working to satisfy group 1. Ultimately, I think this is a more responsible course of action - I'd rather have a few complaints now than 2000 complaints when YuFu ships. I'm sorry for the delay, but it will work out in the end. I'm working long hours on YuFu - it's going to be great and ship soon. For all the reasons you backed the project in the first place, you will be happy with it when you get it! Thanks! Jon @Charmianne - we'll be adding more staff in due course. The Kickstarters are to raise money for building and shipping product. @Rita - thanks for your support. @Adrian - please read the latest update I made last week, your comment is offensive. @William - there are so many steps involved - I need to make sure each part works before moving to the next, if we released parts that couldn't interoperate, that would be a major flaw. doing our best to get it all shipped asap. @all - please read the update that was posted 6 days ago. You will need to log in to see it. There is nothing further to add at this time, when there is - another update will be posted! Other Projects - as some of you have commented. I have other projects in the funding stage... as I said in my previous update: New Products - aka why are you crowd funding more products when the YuFu hasn't shipped? You might also note that I am continuing our program of expanding the HEX3 product line - with the aClock, Luvy and StormTag (now on Kickstarter). There are various stages to our new product development cycle and there are not many conflicts or overlaps. If there is a conflict for time or development, our highest priority product is the YuFu and this will remain so until it ships, new work is always delayed until after any YuFu work. Products can take 6-12 months to develop and the rough timeline might look like this: 1. Concept work - Jon and Industrial Designer 2. Full ID and prototype - Industrial Designer, Electronics Engineer, contracted prototype manufacturer. 3. Kickstarter campaign video and photography - Jon 4. Campaign - Jon 5. Electronics Engineering - this is time consuming and involves PCB manufacture, integration with other electronics in the case of YuFu, intellectual property registration and protection, sourcing long lead time parts, fabrication, testing, testing testing... then multiple iterations if required to rectify problems as they arise. This is definitely the longest and most frustrating time in any electronics project, since nothing else can start until EE is complete. EE blocks the final industrial design, tooling of parts, all manufacturing and software development. EE can also be expensive! As an example, it takes 3 weeks to make a new PCB if a change is required, it then needs to be tested before being revised if required - just 2 iterations of the PCB can take 2 months. But the thing is here - there are several weeks where the EE is waiting for parts, and other work can be done. 6a. Software - SDK development, can now begin. As soon as the firmware is completed the SDK developers make it work with Apps. 6b. Final ID, complete the support structure designs or chassis for the electronics. (concurrent with 6a) 7. Final working drawings to factories. 8. Tooling and manufacturing process. 9. Distribution As you can see, while I am supervising a lot of projects, each one is at a different stage and they can certainly overlap. No delays are caused by other projects. For example the aClock is now at stage 5 and the YuFu is at 6 and 7, the Luvy is at 4, and Stormtag is at 4. Importantly many of the internal electronics are the same in YuFu, aClock and StormTag - the BTLE chip for example - so we get economies of scale and similar software can often be used. Many of you have backed all of my projects, some of you just the YuFu either way; thanks for your faith in me - the YuFu really is a game changer and you will be very happy with it! Batteries! A few of you have asked about batteries... As I mention in the update - I'm using the extra time while I wait for parts to be made to devise a rechargeable battery for the YuFu which will be interchangeable, this will be available after the YuFu ships. So it will allow you to use both AAAA and also a rechargeable. Update Published - Thanks for your patience while we build the worlds most innovative stylus, we're working as fast as possible to deliver you the best stylus possible. BTW @Travis - I didn't blame other people, I mentioned that I had some personal matters to attend to on Friday afternoon which prevented me from completing the promised update at that time. @Travis - Thanks for keeping me on my toes, update is being written now. There will be an update in 7-10 days. Production has started, but there are still a few dots to join wrt firmware. Yes it's running a month late as of today. The delay was mentioned in my last update. For those of you who are anxious for delivery - I'm sorry, but this process can not be hurried. There is literally nothing I can so to speed things up any more. Things are progressing - a proper update will be posted soon. Thanks for your patience while we build the best stylus possible. BTW @Robin I can assure you that I am working as fast as possible to produce a great product. When you get your YuFu, you will understand what has taken the time..! @Robin - sorry you took my comment to be rude... which bit of my comment do you find offensive? @Siavash - yes. @Everybody - I have backed 60 projects myself and personally prefer to only get updates when there is real news, but maybe I am more patient than most? Constant updates will not change the time it takes. The YuFu is definitely progressing, although more slowly than I'd prefer. There are over 100 parts in the stylus and they obviously all have to work perfectly together before I can release the product. Anyone with any experience with product development will understand that good things take time and iterations in hardware can take a week or two - sometimes three! I'm working as quickly as possible but I will only do updates when there is real news to report. The YuFu will ship when it is ready, it *cannot* ship before that. I recommend that you read my last update regarding other project timelines, if you still have questions *that I have not answered already* please send a message. Thanks Travis, I'm not sure what the point of your comment was? Please read update #10, shipping update is mentioned there - maybe you missed that? For a schedule of when updates will be made please look at the schedule, it's found near the bottom of the project page, here's a link: <url>"updates". The most recent one was 7 days ago. I can't respond to every individual comment on all our kickstarter pages, but instead respond to the most common questions in updates. My team and I are focused on delivering product, so please have patience while we prioritize that. Questions about shipping, add-ons, address changes etc will be addressed in one update just prior to shipping, addressing any of these things now may lead to changes or confusion later. Individual questions of an URGENT nature can be sent to customer service here: <url>"I have requested Amazon to refund the full $80 of your transaction." and separately: "No you cannot change the pledge, the transaction has been refunded." Both statements are straight forward and should not require much clarification. That said, I'm terribly sorry that it has not been possible for me to handle this as rapidly as you would like... 1. You confirmed you wanted a refund on Sun, Jan 19, 2014 at 4:14 AM. 2. I attempted to refund via Amazon on Sunday afternoon, I got an error and emailed Amazon customer service. 3. Amazon replied to my customer service request on Mon, Jan 20, 2014 at 12:29 PM. 4. I have been on a plane, in bed or in a factory in Taiwan since then. 5. It's now almost midnight in Taiwan, and I have now taken the steps Amazon suggested to rectify the error. 6. Expect funds back in your account early next week. The end. Nothing more need be said, so I won't. Syreeta, Please calm down. As was said quite clearly in the last email to you - you will receive a refund for the full amount through Amazon. When we attempted to process that over the weekend their form gave an error, so we raised it with their customer service. Since you are getting a refund, your reward was cancelled; this should neither be mysterious nor surprising to you. Hi guys, no need to be concerned. Bamboo a Bee is the correct account, it's simply the old company name from before Hex3 was formed - when we did our first Kickstarter a few years ago. Thanks guys :-) Awesome, thanks for your support folks! :-) I think that makes it officially beer o'clock! 30 seconds folks - last chance! :-) Thanks - there's a few excited people here too! :-) @Angela, the Webpage will be updated next week when my web guy is back in the office. I would have preferred to have it pre-setup, but didn't get to it before the holidays! @Angela - after the Kickstarter ends we cannot edit the page, I changed it just in case I lose connection - I'm in a fairly remote area! :-) It's midday here on the Murray River in Australia! tick... tick... tick... :-) Prices are US Dollars. Not long to go now! @Steve - The case prototype we received needed to changes - the case and tips will definitely be worthwhile and the case will not be available separately after the campaign. @Gabriela - thanks! @William - when we collect the addresses and colors we will offer some extra tips for sale at that time. @Eric - yes so long as the Windows device has compass, gyro accelerometer we can support all features. @Syreeta - the difference between the Focus and Pro is negligible, the weight with battery is 19.5, the battery is around 6grams. The YuFu range are around the same weight as a mechanical pencil. @Rita - we might get there- it will be close! @Shadow - yes it includes the case and tips @Syreeta - I said "both the Focus and the Pro have the sensor in the same position and use the same finger pad mechanism". I also said the exact design might change a tiny bit. Hi folks, With 26 hours to go and $4690 to go, we still have a great chance of hitting the final stretch goal - please share and tweet - it all helps! Thanks for your enthusiasm. Here's something I just sent to one of our backers to answer some queries - I hope it clears things up... It's only just morning here in Australia... Kickstarter is a place where we get to meet our customers for the first time, so it's great to see the passion from our first customers! Kickstarter is also where we first hear about any problems or queries that they have about our products - this helps shape our products. Everyone knows that Kickstarter is not a shop, the products are not fully iterated, we have some work to do still and that is why we are raising money here. We are very advanced in our designs and software development and reached the stage where we are 100% confident of delivery, so we launched it on Kickstarter to fund the remaining software iterations and hardware tooling and manufacturing refinement. That said, both the Focus and the Pro have the sensor in the same position and use the same finger pad mechanism, the Focus will use a less expensive pressure sensor. The Pro has tighter tolerances on the pressure sensor - and in actual fact is capable of determining 10's of thousands of levels of force variation, largely irrelevant when dealing with the precision of the human hand and brain, but still it's there! :-) I hear what you say about the grip based pressure sensor, we know this hasn't been done before, and that we need to pay particular attention to ensuring it works exactly right. It works well, but without you holding one, of course it can't be demonstrated perfectly. I developed the first ever pressure sensitive stylus for the iPad a few years ago and everything we did there was totally new - even the use of high frequency sound instead of Bluetooth - (BTLE did not exist then) - so trust me, we know how to innovate and create new products! :-) Whilst we have working prototypes of all our products, the designs are by no means final and we can and will make small alterations over the next few months as we go into mass production with our factory and their engineers. Our backers know that we have their interests at heart - I know what people want, we know from 2 years of JaJa sales - and after all, I designed the product you see on our Kickstarter page! So whilst I say there might be some small changes, it's unlikely that you will see anything too different in the final product, and the design and features will be improved and refined. So the durability, manufacturability and importantly the usability will also improve - until we have a product suitable for the mass market. The palm rejection in the Focus relies on algorithms to determine your palm position - this is similar to how the Jot Touch and Pogo Connect work - but art Apps don't generally support this because the multi touch used in most Art Apps causes it to fail. (We added and accelerometer to the Focus to improve the accuracy of the tip position - this isn't used in Palm Rejection though.) In the Pro we have added a compass to determine the direction the YuFu is pointing, an accelerometer to determine the direction and speed of movement and a multi Axis gyroscope to determine the 3D orientation of the stylus. This data is all then compared to the iPad sensor data and the position of the stylus tip can be more accurately calculated - using some rather fancy code that is still being developed. We certainly have the design, and know it works, but funding the software development is part of the reason we are on Kickstarter. Also, here is a very rough feature table you might find useful: <url>"beamer"? @Thomas - I will take a look at that, but the Black Nickel version will give you the look you are after. @Michael - I'm sorry, but until our next round of prototypes is complete I can't demonstrate anything new. I had expected them before the holidays, but they have not been delivered yet. @Anthonny - our fine tip will be of a similar dimension to the Jot, but will be a softer material so it doesn't make as much noise. It will also be finer in the last few mm of the pen, so it provides more visibility. Thanks all - 6am New Years Eve here, I hope you have a fun time tonight where ever you are (and when ever your tonight is! :-) @Syreeta what I meant to add was, I am not sure that there any 1.5V rechargeables - often they are only 1.2V. What's more, and as I said - dismantling 9V batteries is not recommended at all by us. @H - I misread your question. Yes they will work. @Alexandre - will work with both. @H - it can only work on touch screens @Syreeta - not sure that there are rechargeable I'd recommend using proper AAAA rather than dismantling 9V. to add to my answer below... 1x AAAA will be included in the pack. But they are also available here: <url>"contact us", or "suggestions" page to ask for YuFu support! Thanks Hi Yudi, Yes that will work. Thanks Frank! Appreciate your support :-) Firstly sorry for the delayed response - there are several places we get messages on Kickstarter, and comments on the main project don't go into my "inbox" I missed these earlier. @Walter - for just basic navigation and the occasional quick line drawing or annotation the basic YuFu would be great - and it is a very nicely finished product as well. :-) @Gene - the rubber pad where you naturally rest your finger has the sensor under it - it's very simple to get used to, and feels quite natural. Our sensor is a real force sensor - not a movement sensor like both the Pogo and Jot, I will go into more depth about the sensor during an update this coming week. @Andrew - thanks, not totally convinced on the magnetic attachment :-) - but the main problem is the size, we are using every available space with electronics! I'll investigate further. @Rajesh - I wouldn't agree that I spring any surprises!! :-) Firstly the offset can be very easily fixed with some software changes, you will see in our "risks" section for Nota and also in the timeline of Nota that the final few weeks are improving the accuracy. Also, the apparent offset you see in the video is made worse by the parallax error caused by the camera angle. The App I am using has a larger offset towards either side - the offset really isn't very bad. I'll do a better video very soon to allay your fears! :-) @William - I'm thinking about expanding support for other OS, and also maybe doing another type of tip. Announcement soon. @Jokin - it is not that much. The important thing to understand is that there is not always the same offset with all Apps - there is a big variation in how different developers deal with parallax. When you use your finger the line appears under your finger and you cannot see it - fat tip styluses hide this, and ultrafine tips need some correction - we'll have something you are happy with I can assure you! @Mance @Alejandro - We'd love to see our styluses supported by these great Apps - the best way to get support for your favourite Apps is to email their customer support and ask. We obviously do what we can, but App developers listen to their users more than us :-) (don't leave reviews on their Apps) @Ron - As long as the Smartphone has support for Bluetooth4 (LE) the Focus and Pro will work on them in pressure sensitive mode - please consider that not all art and notes Apps are available in the smaller form factor though @Johnny - Yes the Art pack has 6 tips in total. We are still finalising the design for the case - I should have the prototype today. We will consider the size and comfortable use of the case in the final design. We won't be doing a fully round version - they roll of desks! The grip of our stylus is round though, and it is very comfortable. Most wooden pencils ever made were hexagonal - they stay where you put them on a flat surface and offer a little bit of rotational grip. I think you will be very happy with the comfort of the YuFu - it is also the lightest stylus available at just 19.5 grams with a battery. @Brian, yes correct - it work as a fine point stylus. @Graham our styluses work on all retina iPads and the iPad mini's. The Pogo has what they claim is an "exotic" pressure sensor - it's the reason that it doesn't work. Ours uses a far more robust system. I am not aware of the Wacom problems you mention. @Hao - I know my highest score with dots is with the JaJa Teflon tip! But sadly, I don't really get a lot of time to test out with games - I thinkt he brush would be quite good for the game syou mention though. @Wei - we are still finalising the battery budget for both and this won't be absolutely final until we have production units and compare the two - I would estimate the the Focus might have a 30% greater battery life. @Gaelan - the SDK software is still being worked on, I would hope to be able to demo this soon. @Kaijun - Yes, there is palm rejection on the Focus which uses an algorithm to determine where the side of your hand is resting. The far more advanced palm rejection is found in the Pro which uses the onboard sensors to determine orientation and tilt of the stylus compared to the iPad/tablet. Both systems need the Bluetooth LE to work with the iPad or Tablet. The basic YuFu has no palm rejection since it is not active and has no electronics. @Wei - yes it does have one spare tip @Darren - the ultrafine tips should last a considerable time - we are yet to do friction testing on production units. We are still finalising the construction of the production tip, we want to keep it pretty quiet though, so it will likely be silicon. @Rajesh - Yes the extra YuFu in the Art Set is a basic YuFu which can use any of the tips. I have a few people ask me a similar question, so I will get a table done up to explain it better. In the Art Set you get: 1. YuFu Pro with 2 ultrafine tips 2. The case with 3 spare tips - teflon, brush and 6mm rubber 3. A basic YuFu with a 6mm rubber and a Teflon tip. @Carlos, cool - well spotted. I can't get them delivered to me, but I will test them before we launch. The pack will come with a battery to get you started. The best price I found on Amazon was around $0.90. @Alejandro - you're welcome :-) @German - Yes, it will work with both iPad Mini (sorry for the slow replies - it's morning here, so will be on hand all day and night now :-) @Alejandro - The YuFu Pro will work only as a fine point stylus on the iPad 2, the pressure sensitivity, palm rejection, angle etc will not work because BluetoothLE is needed for that. All the spare tips will work just fine too - so if you were to buy the YuFu Pro you could use it now, and if/when you upgrade iPad in the future you will have the extra features... @Hao - Yes, there is power on/off. Yes there is an LED. It is very simple. thanks! :-) Yes, that will work Andrew. @Dominic, yes the ultrafine tip for the Focus and Pro will work on most tablets including the Nexus. The App support for pressure sensitivity etc will come when developers integrate the Apps. @Rajesh Firstly, that timeline shows shipping in January, the line with January under it is the *start* of January. The Nota is very much on schedule for shipping in January. Secondly - you will find an update here: <url>"manage your pledge" button. @William @occam, thanks! @Occam, we might try and do a soft case as a stretch goal. The hard case might look bigger in the drawing than it really is - I will have prototypes here in 7 days so you can see the scale. I'll get an image up with each of the colors named on it before the end of the campaign, for the moment please use the main image as a guide. The nickel plate I got as a sample is too silver for my liking - it is the right hand one in the main image - I wanted it a bit darker, I will work with our factory to get this exactly right. It will be something like this image: <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill."

Encore de l’argent d’escroquer par un projet proposé par Kickstarter. 50 % des projets sont des arnaques, c’est l’expérience que j’en ai, 50 % des projets que j’ai financé sur Kickstarter comme sur Indiegogo, n’aboutisse pas et on n’est pas remboursé. J’en ai fini des financements participatif, marre de me faire prendre pour un con et me faire escroquer, avec le soutient de ces sites. More crooks. They didn't do their product and then he said he d pay back, he didn't do it. More money to swindle by a project proposed by Kickstarter. 50% of the projects are scams, that's the experience I have, 50% of the projects I ve funded on Kickstarter as in Indiegogo, don't succeed and we re not refunded. J’1 is finished with participatory financing, tired of getting me caught up for a Dick and swinging me, with the support of these sites. <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill."

STILL NO REFUND TO SAY ITS A CRIME IS BEYOND A JOKE AT THIS POINT Well, the truth is nothing is received I was reading today that he was busted for abuse and sexual harassment with under age children. And to top it off he’s a fraudster. This guy is a fucking loser. I invoke my rights under Kickstarter's Terms of Use: <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill." I demand a full refund for my pledge amount! Still no refund... Nothing... Its sureal... Since I am tired of grifters like this **** I have finally filed a police report for Fraud and Theft Over $5000. We are getting a warrant to serve Kickstarter to get all of this purported con artists information and attempting to go after him in both Canada and the US (I'm a Dual Passport-holding Citizen). I suggest you all do the same thing - file a police report. This is what grifting is - a long con and that is what happened to all of us - we fell victim to a con artist known as a grifter. It's been 4 years, I have never received my pledge or a update. Instead, this Yufu guy keeps sending me the promotional email for his tons of new products! Is this Jon Atherton guy sick? I also just got a survey from BackerKit. O.O What kind of sick joke is that??? Oh, and the "refund"? I never got a single letter, no check, no apologies whatsoever. How about you guys? :/ Hi Jon I just received a very confusing an concerning "survey" asking me to pick my Yufu color and accessories. Is this some sort of sick joke? Are you a recovering drug addict? Sersiously. It's 2017. The Yufu lost any relevancy many years ago. I've got an Apple Pencil and an iPad pro now. Why would I want this piece of garbage cluttering my personal space? If you have any semblance of decency left in you just send a refund. Even if you haven't spent our money on drugs and alcohol by now it certainly isn't worth now what it was years ago when you took it from us in exchange for false promises. Just got my survey for shipping... lol christopher. That **** Jon regularly logs in to Kickstarter. Must be working out the details for his next scam. Did the stylus ship yet? As per my earlier post, never believed the refund process was an authentic effort to refund people. Swung by here curious as to what's happened lately and see nothing's changed. SCAM Seriously Concerning Antagonistic Manner by the creator of this project. Haven't backed any IT related projects since andIntroduction to SPM™ concept & methodology in relation to Software Lifecycle Management. Where are those strident supporters of Jon who kept backing him when the writing was already in plain view. In a way you are partly responsible for the absence of return, as it gave him more time to distance himself from his responsibilities. You meant well, but well meaning support doesn't change the true colours of someone. However, move on people. Keep the reminders here so anyone that looks this up for reference KNOWS that this was the complete LOSS and FAILURE that it is, but otherwise enjoy your precious lives. Sven's comment is worthy, use it as the cost of learning a lesson in what not to do. CIAO Kind of wish there was a button to warn off others from backing any projects by this guy. I have backed other kickstarter projects and, sure, not all have been successful. Still none of the others have behaved as unprofessionally, drowning us with commercials about both this and other projects, while seriously lacking in information and response. Wow, people are still here. I gave up on this long ago. Just ran across and old e-mail and curiosity got me. Take it as a learning experience. Education can cost you money, whether you get it at a college, or at Kickstarter. Bonjour, I agree with everybody...still no news about my refund..shame on Kickstarter. I will never recommend this website ��� Agreed, filled out my form as well on the day I recieved it. But still nothing from the company here. KICKSTARTER - How about you do something here ? There has been a breach of your T&C's and your absolute silence in the matter in a disgrace. I have pointed out in a letter already to Kickstarter and my last forum post here on the 29th of August Your own T&C state that a Backer's responsibilities are (among other things) •they post an update that explains what work has been done, how funds were used, and what prevents them from finishing the project as planned; - NOT DONE, we have absolutely no idea where the $141,173 he raised from backers has been spent, I presume it was not all spent, hence the request for our details months ago for sending out a cheque for the "unused amount". But why does Kickstarer not do something to enforce this. •they’re able to demonstrate that they’ve used funds appropriately and made every reasonable effort to complete the project as promised; - CERTAINLY HAS NOT BEEN DEMONSTRATED The Silence of both the Creator Jon and Kickstarter to this is a disgrace. Come On Kickstarter - The very least you can do here (and remember you took 5% of the proceeds so earned $7,058 from us backers here) is to force Jon to provide an actual update detailing what has actually gone on here along with some detailed financials showing where our money has gone. If you have tried that and have had no success then please detail that process for us in writing so we have as much information as we can to pursue our own legal remedies. Still no news on my refund. I have patiently waited. I have filled out the form. Did the info get lost? Do you need a new form? I'm still waiting for my Cheque. Whether Good Karma or Bad Karma will befall you depends on your next decisions. Beneficial rewards or ill gotten gains will be repaid many folds. Please choose wisely. Filled out my request for refund immediately when it was offered - still have a screenshot as proof. Nothing from Atherton or anyone - just disappeared into the ether with all my info and money...I've quit Kickstarter and all other similar sites and I am speaking with counsel to arrange for a Class Action Lawsuit in Canada for all affected here. I suggest someone in the US and whatever country you are from to do the same. This is straight up fraud. I also filed a police report with my local police force and encourage you to do the same. This is a criminal act regardless of any "fine print", especially if you had your credit card attached as your payment method via Kickstarter. Unfortunately the time had passed when we were notified to fill out refund form to start an investigation with my financial institution that issued the card that was charged. This is total BS. @creator - i guess i was right you being a scam artist. Now you are not even verbally abusing us in the comments section. I know you said you were going to look me up and sue me for defamation of character. I am still waiting. #loser! Oh wow, this is truly the comments section that keeps on giving It's almost worth the 60 dollars in entertainment to see Jon insult backers and drag Gamergate into the mix for no reason whatsoever Oh and yeah no news of the chèques either, but I knew my money was gone the seconds the delays started Oh well, live and learn One tip for your next Kickstarter Jon: don't automatically sign up people for your newsletter where you offer discounts for the same product they've backed, it kinda feels like you're mocking them ya know? Kckstarter does'nt offer any guarantees at all to pledgers. Unfortunately i think Mr Atherton had no intention of paying anybody back purely because the project failed and there was no money to give back. This is the second time i have wasted money on kickshiter, seems like a nice way for some people (not all) to scam and generate extra cash. Kickstarter needs to step in here and act as a go-between so that if a project fails money is refunded. Wont ever pledge again!! Any update on the refunds???? still no refund....... followed with the refund process on the day it was announced and still no refund... I agree with Robert! We should more conscious about our position. Is there someone that believe in Jon Atherton? Very disappointing as an Australian in what would have been a good product but I've moved on with a surface pro and pen and an apple pro with pen don't need this anymore and have come to the realisation that the money is gone, still I will never back another project by Jon and will actively discourage others Oh come on!!! We give you more than a year and you give us one month. How fair is that? I missed deadline because of an unexpected tragic family emergency and several other disheartening contributing factors. How do I get my money back Most regretful person/project I've backed so far. there is probably no money left - unfortunately its time to move on Filled out my request for refund immediately when it was offered - still have a screenshot as proof. Nothing from Atherton or anyone - just disappeared into the ether with all my info and money... didn't get my refund either. did anyone?? Hello, what is the timeframe for refunds? It has been quite a while. No updates on the refund offer that was posted in May. Jon still apparently comes on Kickstarter regularly as you can see by his profile. I fear Hex3's offer of a reward was as honest as the rest of his dealings with us. I at least would appreciate a personal apology to his backers, it would take some of the bitter taste out of this campaign, but judging by his past behavior I don't expect it. As of now I certainly wouldn't support any other project or company that Jon is involved with. btw their website is not up running anymore. Never got the refund, this is been couple months or even a year? I am still waiting for my refund. Wondering if anyone has received one??. Damn SCAM! i guess Jon is not watching the comment section anymore. I'm sure he's still trying to figure out how to sue me for defamation. i would love to counter with SCAM, and over seas money laundering Never received refund? Who should I contact? What happen to the refund?? Still waiting.... Project Risks: 1. Design. We have completed a full design program including multiple rounds of prototyping to ensure our product not only looks great but also has excellent functionality and mechanical design. 2. Electronics. The PCB design is complete, and operational. There are some minor adjustments required for an integrated force sensor and power switch, and also the power LED. We also need to perform full testing of the fine point tip in production. Both of these will be tweaked in the T1 unit - ie after tooling is complete. In combination with electronics enhancements and an update to the JaJa SDK we will have full support by the time the YuFu ships. 3. Manufacturing partner. We have identified a strong manufacturing partner. assuming we are successful we'll travel to meet with them and finalise the manufacturing schedule in the 3 weeks following the completion of the Kickstarter completion. We also have strong relationships with other factories if required. 4. Distribution. We currently work with one of the larger 3PL companies and we utilise warehouses in Hong Kong, UK, and 2 in the USA - LA and PA. We do not consider distribution a risk, although managing the flow of product doesn't always run smoothly, we understand what is required. 5. There are always unforeseen circumstances, but we do not think that this project is very high risk. We have working units and have the experience to deliver. Still love the lies in their risks....... Especially risk 1 which we found was far~ from the truth.. No point to keep discussing this and begging this and that. Let's just say that Jon is a scammer, you can google his name and you'll see he did this before in 2007, and somehow got away with it. Let's say all this is true. What avenues usually have people scammed like this ? I'm sure there must be a procedure for that. Don't tell me usually scammers get away scot free, because that's not true. What's the usual procedure ? @creator - what's going on with the refunds? Hey Jon... did you skip town? In a way glad to hear everyone else is still awaiting any sort of notification on the refund, so is not just me. But I 100% agree with you Scott, by taking their 5% and keeping it when the project fails, it means Kickstarter don't really care about whether a project is successful or not, as they have no skin in the game. To me that makes them complicit in what I am calling at this point fraud. I have complained to them via email, to which they sent a copy of their T&C's but basically washed their hands of any responsibility. When I pointed out he seems to be in breach of those they simply didn't seem to care, the below points are taken directly from the Project creator responsibilities with my comments in capitals so you can ready then •they post an update that explains what work has been done, how funds were used, and what prevents them from finishing the project as planned; - NOT DONE •they work diligently and in good faith to bring the project to the best possible conclusion in a timeframe that’s communicated to backers; - DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE DONE THIS •they’re able to demonstrate that they’ve used funds appropriately and made every reasonable effort to complete the project as promised; - CERTAINLY HAS NOT BEEN DEMONSTRATED •they’ve been honest, and have made no material misrepresentations in their communication to backers; and – HARD TO KNOW GIVEN IT NOW APPEARS PREVIOUS UPDATES MAY HAVE BEEN FALSE •they offer to return any remaining funds to backers who have not received their reward (in proportion to the amounts pledged), or else explain how those funds will be used to complete the project in some alternate form. – YES THEY HAVE NOW OFFERRED A REFUND OF THE REMAINING FUNDS BUT AS WE HAVE NO FINANCIAL DETAILS OF WHAT HAS BEEN SPENT AND WHERE ALEADY IT IS HARD TO KNOW HOW MEANINGFUL THIS IS. Sure there is a risk in funding these sort of project, I get and understand that, I think the thing that annoys people most here is the resounding sound of silence from Jon. If he in an honest and straight forward way explained to us why this project failed where the funds had gone etc... then I doubt there would be the anger amongst the backers that their no doubt now is. Sending backers mails trying to encourage them to order more product at a 50% discounted price, multiple times over the past years, when they failed to even deliver the initially payed for item certainly appears fraudulent to me. But Jon could clear the air here by posting with some honest details where the $141,173 he has raised here went, maybe I wold have some sympathy, but keeping us backers in the dark after we tried to support I'm to get his dream off the ground is both insulting and goes a long way to illustrate the sort of ethics they have. Cindy, not sure if the form will still work, but here is the link from the mail they sent me back in may <url>"Protect" their investment in projects on an optional basis. This optional to insurance policy would guarantee accountability from the project maker. Imagine the amount of money that could be made I think Kickstarter is missing an opportunity. Still waiting on my check to arrive - have a feeling that the postage on the envelope will be worth more than the check inside. I want my money back please @Jon Atherton Please just send the check!!! I wonder if posting cheques out like this, is a way that allows them to say that they issued refunds, while knowing full well that many backers won't deposit them (assuming they actually do receive them). If the cheques are not cashed, they retain the funds. Perhaps someone should set up a facility to receive these cheques and deposit them in Hong Kong to ensure the full revenues associated with this refund materialise. It's also worth noting that from the beginning, Hex 3 was registered in the USA and Australia. Liability for those entities shouldn't end simply because they now declare they are based in and/or handling this from Hong Kong. Never saw the email, so what he just takes my money? filled out refund request 6 weeks ago.... nothing What about full refunds for items purchased, yes that's right purchased, using backerkit? These add-on's had absolutely nothing to do with kickstarter. Answers please @creator. Never heard anything after filling request. June 30th have past and no check nor refund via Paypal thus far. I want my refund via PayPal there is probably no money left to refund us. The refund page is not working... Yes, please return my money to my Paypal account. The idea of sending International cheques back to your international backers is a nonsense, even if I were to receive a full refund, international bank clearance fees for USD cheques would absorb most of the refund. Respect the people who believed in you and backed your project don't give them a final slap in the face now by sending international backers a USD cheque that will take a large portion of that refund amount to actually bank. I would suggest maybe read that little note on the bottom of this comments box "Be Respectful and Considerate" this should flow both ways. Refunds should be offered in the same way as you took the funds (Pay Pal) filled out my form 3 weeks ago... no email confirmation #KIckstarter failing to protect backers from obvious frauds. Jon is a con man. That was evident a long time ago. Kickstarter should have stepped in. Backing a project is a risk - we should remember that - no guarantee it will make it to the finish line. but being cheated is a different matter. Jon made some money but (hopefully) stained his reputation for life. We lost our money and were insulted. Kickstarted made it's cut and didn't even have to spend any time or effort investigating this. This lack of accountability and backer protection calls for some sort of action. maybe by just spreading the word on Jon Atherton scam and KS indifference would make KS be less passive in cases like this one. I believe it might be a good idea to all of us here to file a class action lawsuit. The terms of refund are a joke and this is borderline fraud. With a class action lawsuit we still won't get all of our money...but he won't be pulling this again. I am backer 171 and would like a refund. I pledged $99. I would like my refund through PayPal. I'm also requesting a refund. As I paid for a second one, I want a full refund for both. Total $165 Never asked for a foreign cheque, I want my refund via a good çold online transaction, the same way I paid my part back then. I want my refund via PayPal Not holding my breath, that's for sure, but it only takes a few moments to fill out the form, you never know...pigs may just fly.... If you really think you're getting any money back, you're only kidding yourself. This is just another way for Jon to walk away without any liability. What about full refunds for items purchased, yes that's right purchased, using backerkit? These add-on's had absolutely nothing to do with kickstarter. Answers please @creator. when can I expect to see my $64 back in my Paypal? Please refund per paypal instead of a cheque. thx Refund via Paypal please I haven't moved. Where's my refund? The first failed kickstarter I've backed. Sorry to hear about this, at least there's a refund. What an insult. I suppose it's a nice, token effort, but I'd be surprised if any of us get even half of what we paid to back this project. KS fees and bank fees, as well as the bank fees we'll have to incur once we get our cheques, will likely end up costing many of us even more money. Never mind that many of us paid additional money for things like extra tips or protective cases which don't seem to be on the table for refund. Never mind we're being promised just a portion of what is *left,* rather than a refund of our actual pledges. I'm honestly stunned by this entire process. Jon has taken all of us and I suspect this "refund" is merely just a way for him to stay out of deeper trouble than he has already gotten himself into. Years ago, in an effort to keep everyone happy during one of many delays, he decided to offer a case to everyone as a way to smooth things over. Several people, including myself, asked what those of us who paid for cases would be getting and were ignored. Whenever anyone objected he'd remind them we were all required to be polite or threatened people with liable suits. His last post in the comments here was a defense of his photos, ignoring the hundreds of comments asking for refunds or updates. What an unethical and unremorseful person. Jon, how about an apology? Given what you've done to everyone here, both in terms of missing the deadlines that you yourself set, bullying individuals who dared to question you, and crying foul when people tried to hold you to the same standard you expected from everyone else, it's the very least we deserve. Thanks for the refund Hi Jon, Thank you for coming through with the refunds. I agree that cheques, in this day and age, are definitely not the way to go - why should the banks get money? Is there no way you can get this done electronically? Wishing you the best for your future endeavours. @Jon Atherton, I've got a qn. I changed names and countries since I backed this, and my backerkit was updated, but do I write in the old name in the refund box? (Even though that would make chashing in the cheque hard) Great to finally hear what we all knew was coming. But to now offer cheque refunds seems like another kick from HEX3. and I also believe it will be a 10c cheque refund! from a non existent refund pool! But I thought that would happen about a year ago or so.... so on to the other 3 Kickstarter projects that seem to be at the same stage ....Kickstarter is becoming another synonym for SKAM disappointed is all I'll say. Have had a MS surface Pro with pressure sensitive stylus for a month or more now. This project ( and a couple of others ) has certainly made me fund less Kickstarter projects. I just hope Kickstarter look at this and I hope Jon looks at his communication, if it was updated on a regular basis I would have been happy even at this stage. R.I.P Thanks Jon, producing tech stuff is a demanding position to be in. Wish you the best. Fellow backers: you've got to ask yourself how much time and emotion is this worth, I stopped reading updates last year, I kept the Hex3 emails coming just for a reminder to be cautious. Is $50 worth 4 hours of your time, or affecting you enough that you take it out on a loved one? (for me it was $145) Don't hold on to anger, it leads to the dark side. Jon Atherton: A little soul searching yourself is in order, treating yourself like a business case, examining your strengths and weaknesses. It can't have been mentally healthy to come back here for years. We all have flaws, exposing them means you show weakness, but there is a world of people that believe in being something better, Kickstarter backers are great examples, but you didn't communicate and collaborate by having constructive conversations with people here that are smarter than you or I. Realizing your limitations just a step to overcoming them. I backed this, and aClock that was never on Kickstarter but there was an option for aClock the refund form. I hope this isn't just a penny refund to meet a legal indemnification consideration requirement but understand I am wary. At last Hex3 comes clean about the failure of this project. Despite being lied to over and over by Jon with his assurances of project progress and completion the project dies an ignominious death. The idea of refund by cheque is ridiculous, refunds should be done electronically to avoid the costs of bank processing and postage too. Those costs are now our money and the people managing the refund process should bear this carefully in mind. Accounts need to be made available for our review NOW. I have also moved and input my new address in the form! I agree it would save a lot of hassle on everyone if you did a paypal refund! I totally agree that this is 2016 and we should be refunded electronically. Paypal is probably the easiest. I also never got my Nota/Jaja from you guys. So what is being done about backerkit purchases post kickstarter funding. Backerkit purchases have nothing to do with KS funds. When will I get full refunds of my backerkit purchase? Lol... so we paid online and we will be receiving a pro rata cheque from which a €5 ($8) bank processing fee and another $2 currency exchange are deducted! I would be lucky if I end up with $10! Refund should be sent by the means of the original payment i.e. online! Thanks for offering refund - I have moved address so put my new address on the form as I have no access to my old property. Thanks! So what is being done about backerkit purchases post kickstarter funding. Backerkit purvhases have nothing to do with KS funds. When will I get full refunds of my backerkit purchase? Taken from update #17 <url>"b" below. "There are a lot of you growing anxious and many who are quite annoyed. Let me assure you that: a. I am still working on this project b. There are sufficient funds to deliver, but I am managing the budget carefully. c. There is no-one who wants this finished more than me - we have large profitable commercial orders on hold waiting for this to complete, and whilst you and all the other Kickstarter backers are incredibly important - worldwide sales is where I earn my income - this isn't a hobby!" <url>"Great... So, I've moved to another city for a job, and now I shouldn't be able to receive a refund?" -> clearer: I've move to another city more than a year ago, when the projects was alread more than half a year late. Since then, even the "change of address" mail forwarding order has expired (max validity 1 year, since Jan 14th last year, when I moved). "For security reasons we cannot process refunds where data does not match the original backer pledge data." Great... So, I've moved to another city for a job, and now I shouldn't be able to receive a refund? "Your refund will be paid on a pro-rata basis from the available refund pool as calculated on 15 July 2016. " And - how much is that refund pool going to be? And - explain where the rest of the money went (I see reasonable fees for getting some prototype materials - though, I don't think we saw many in your updates - looked more like CG-images) Please refund by paypal to the original email address, if you want "security". Please, provide paypal option. Direct paypal would be prefered, though i guess this serves as a warning to think again before backing projects in future. Costly lesson maybe, though one i probably wont make again. I also backed the storm tag, cant process the claims together so get hit with both sets of unspecified fees. Shouldn't there be a full refund instead of: "Your refund will be paid on a pro-rata basis from the available refund pool as calculated on 15 July 2016. The maximum amount of your refund will equal the amount of your pledge less Kickstarter and bank fees." Agree that refund via Paypal would be useful. Is there a better way to refund money to backers in other countries such as Paypal? Sending a cheque all the way to other country and having the banks here deduct that amount from US seems abit worrisome. I have received the email too. Hope it is true and that the refund goes smoothly Finally, refunds are being offered. Hello, I am requesting a refund ASAP!

Kush... lol Jon, who has not delivered his product to backers after two years is still threatening people. What an unbelievable jerk. Man this is so wrong... I don't think you can even find a word that isn't vulgar to describe Jon at this point. He can take time to launch new webpages for his imaginary products, but can't even take time to post updates with imaginary progress. I'm assuming the chargebacks screwed up his ability to collect payments at hex3.co, hopefully nobody's foolish enough to give him money on the other pages he put up. I already have an iPad Pro and Pencil, so I don't even have a use for this vaporware anymore, but it doesn't change the fact that he robbed everyone with fake promises. I haven't backed any Kickstarter projects since I backed this joke, I'm glad they're just as happy sitting on their small pile of cash as well. AGREE // Muller 1 day ago Jon Atherton is a fraud. His two campaigns on Kickstarter and the way that Kickstarter responds are reason enough for me to never back any other ideas on Kickstarter. Jon Atherton is a fraud.

I think that most people like myself have given up waiting for their product to arrive. I backed your project many 'years' ago to the tune of 55 bucks, not a lot of money in pounds but im glad i didnt back more, when YOU buy anything dont you expect to recieve it at some point or some communication?? Most people here can undestand that these sorts of projects can have complications and run over budget but your communication in this matter has been very poor. Personaly, i now dont care any more and am more dissapointed in KS for letting its consumers down and just want to warn others to choose wisely when backing a gig. Keep the money and the pen with my blessing John. Good luck, i hope it works out for you. I would still like my refund, in full. Also a formal update, not a post in the comment section - I think that is the least you owe us. "The Worlds Smallest Weather Station" So small, the backers will never see it! <url>"terminated" or "failed." Jon's not doing that. Kickstarter isn't doing it. And we can't get Kickstarter to do it. They just keep brushing us off. Until this horse is declared dead - we can't do anything. Even if that happened tomorrow. Good bloody luck trying to communicate with enough backers to DO anything. And your chances of doing anything of a legal nature with no support and a whole lot of precedent against you. I don't like the odds. Face it. We're screwed. Kickstarter is ultimately to blame for having weak ineffectual unenforced policies. I'm requesting that you refund my pledge as it seems at this point that you cannot fulfill it, or are unwilling to. Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill. Terms of use are here: <url>"Jason, since you have so far declined the terms of my offer for a refund, and you don't deserve a reward - you will *never* ever receive anything from me, so you are wasting your time here. I see little point in replying to you again." Right here is a reason for him to end up in jail. Make sure to screen shot that Jason. Looks like you don't deserve a reward, and officially won't get it. Wow. Very illegal. Lol You guys should have known that after how rude he has been from the beginning that this was an incompetent person. Also when you read articles about people scamming others.... These are not just a coincidence. If john is still promising this item to be delivered as he said in this comment; your credit card will still protect you. Even though Amazon charged you years ago, since the delivery had not happened you should be able to get your funds back. Also, make sure to report this case to authorities overseas. As for this guys threats about him suing you on here, don't worry about it. He has said much worse things and treated people like shit while he has stolen from you. The reality is, he rips a lot of people off, it will come to an end soon. I want a full refund too. I have not got any email from Creator yet. I think Jon needs a set of these: <url>"...the terms of my offer for a refund..." I would love a refund. just send it back to me. I will accept your offer if Jason doesn't. Thanks, Marty @Jon, I want a refund in full, as soon as possible. Also, updates should be made via the Updates section - not the comments. You are not communicating with all backers in good faith when you speak only in the comments. I want my refund - what does commenting on here achieve? Use your brain Jon, well at least try. Jon, I think we have all declined your offer or "ransom" for a refund. You are legally obligated to provide me with either a refund or a reward.You might want to check with Kickstarter on these claims. As for your updates, all official updates you provided up until August 2015 stated the project was continuing with no problems and no hints of financial problems. As of September, in comments below you stated you ran out of money, and then you recently stated you had always believed that further funds were necessary (although that information was never provided at any point until a short while ago). As of a few weeks ago, you sent everyone emails stating you would process refunds if we removed all comments from this site, but you also mention you have no further funds. Combine this with the fact that the aClock project just simply stopped, and the people over in the Storm-Tag project are getting the same responses and actions as we are, plus the fact that most of the time when we do hear from you, you are often personally threatening people by stating you know where they live, instead of updating on how the activities for further funding is going. All of these contradictory things make me believe that you are not acting in good faith. Don't reply to me, I do not care. But recognize that the pattern of behaviour seen throughout this project has not been consistent. I want nothing more than my refund to be processed, and to never think of this project ever again. Thanks @Robert Morris, I think your language is very close to the mark: > John, I received your ransom demand via the below e-mail. Your conditions are unacceptable. > I expect the original terms of our agreement to be honoured, and for an unencumbered refund > to be processed immediately. > > Robert Morris Providing a full refund without strings would allow me (and probably many others) to delete this mess from our radars. Get that done and let everyone move on. At this point, I have no hopes of this project at all. It is obvious that Jon has no abilities to complete this project, and just refuses to address any point revolving around the project itself. Jon comes on here and makes personal threats and comments against people as a method of trying to draw this project out. I just can't imagine how anyone would think it best to keep this train wreck rolling instead of just coming clean and admitting that the Storm-Tag, aClock and Yufu projects are all dead and the money from all of them spent. Jon, if you look back in my comment history, I have asked repeatedly for you to explain the status of this project, and to come clean with all these people. All I expect to achieve is for you to be honest and truthful with people that gave you money. It is just so sad that honesty and truthfulness is too much for you. Personal threats seems to be all we can get. Smoke and mirrors but no actual substance. They are hoping for a refund Jon... I would like my refund please. Also - making comments about peoples profile picture.... come on Jon thats low - I'm sure if you want to go down that route we can have some fun with your pictures floating around the web. Jon, after your comments about Robin, how are you any different? You ask why he feels the needs to call you a moron, and then you call him dimwitted. I wish we could get you removed from this project as quickly as you get kickstarter to remove comments. Jon, I for one am glad you removed your dimwitted photo from your account as well. Too bad you can't quite figure out a way to actually communicate an update to the backers of this project with information that actually pertains to the project. Too bad you only feel the need to reply to those that you feel speak badly of you. What does that say of your character? Guilt or shame? Btw Jon that article has nothing to do with any of the comments here. You want to know the source of the ire? Look at all he companies with terrible customer service and ask them why customers come back angry at them. It has everything to do with service and nothing to do with shaming. The second you stop bsing and refund everyone is the second we all disappear. Two more comments and yet not a single mention of attempt to complete the project, just trying to make himself look like a victim. The Kickstarter page says shipping in April 2014. You will not get any sympathy given its about to be April 2016. Here's an interesting video I watched. <url>#ConMan In case Jon decides to remove his own comments, he stated the following: As I also said back in September, to that date, the cost to develop the software, the hardware and the industrial design for the project had been considerably more than the funds raised here. The completion of this project was always dependent on extra funding from me and by necessity, since mid 2014, I needed to apply my own funds that I had allocated to other things. So, if this project was to be completed at all depended entirely on whether I was able to raise more funds elsewhere - the pinheaded dimwits who have been tearing me down here for the last year based on a bullshit article about a groundless legal case have reduced the likelihood of the latter. I'm now exploring other options and will see how that pans out in the next month or two. Nowhere in the campaign page of this project does Jon state that he needed more financing than the kickstarter campaign provided. This is EXACTLY why Hex3 and Kickstarter will never see another cent from me ever again, and I will tell everyone I know of how these entities operate. Now we have to see if Jon can provide further financing now that his other "groundless" legal case has been completed. He even sent out emails stating he will give refunds if people remove comments, but from his own submission the other day, he has spent all of the money, and could in no way provide thee refunds even if people removed their comments. I am not sure if a single thing Jon says has any validity or truth. We are just going from one lie to the next with him. Jon, I love how you have certain comments removed as you report them to kickstarter, but your comments which threaten people by stating you have personal information and know where people live should be reported to your local authorities. Jon, in your comments the other day you state, this project was always based on you providing more funds that was collected by Kickstarter. This was never stated in your project description. I had no idea of this, and consider this information to be crucial to my decision to invest in this crappy project. In your description you stated that you had all the work completed and only need manufacturing of the product. You never mentioned that this project would never collect all the money for the vapour activities throughout this product. So you have admitted that you have lied to us through this project. You never stated you required more financing that this Kickstarter project provided. You are obviously using this web site as a fraudulent tool to help you collect money through your hex3 web site. I am SURE THIS IS ILLEGAL even in your own country. Regardless of what people are saying about you, you are currently acting in an illegal manner through this project, as well as your other projects. Yet here you sit threatening legal action for people who speak ill of you. I am not sure you can even understand the illegal things you are doing while threatening people with personal threats. I only wish I could report you to your local authorities. I only wish someone from Australia would report you. I would like my refund too I would like my refund please. The previous page seems to have vanished. Here's a new one. <url>#ConMan This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. Jon, This is the second time I've requested a refund. I've been more than patient. <url>"F U" in the wide blue yonder, I don't Jon's reputation could be damaged any further. #ConMan Jon, did you really think that you can get the community here and else where to clean the bad publicity you rightfully earned? Making demands is not a very clever move : Had you appealed to the community with something like : "sorry people, I fucked up.. Im willing to refund . Please remove the negative comments as I am trying to clean the bad reputation this failure has earned me." Heck - I might have removed these comments.. Asking for ransom in your usual threatening attitude does the opposite. How bout this deal : Refund soon or you can expect backers will exploit every opportunity to expose what they experienced here. That's a lot of angry people with keyboards. ay? I think KS should also be concerned about this .. Very disappointing they didn't step in and still allow this page to show " Pre-order and save 40%" - somebody must still be buying this.. :( Just noticed that you are selling this product through your Hex3 website as if it existed.. Does the merchant service provider you use, mybigcommerce.com, care about the integrity of merchants using their service? And hey, don't blame backers here for turning nasty .. You started Just refund #ConMan Jon requested I remove my comments from the community - ended up contacting Kickstarter here is the response : Maren with Kickstarter Community Support here. I'm happy to look into this for you. As a general policy and for transparency reasons we do not remove any comments from a project page, as long as they are within our Community Guidelines. I'm sorry to hear that this creator has been giving you the runaround with this. We are reaching out to him and hopefully this can be resolved soon. Please let me know if there's anything else I can help you with. Best, Maren John, your demands for offering us refunds are not acceptable. You have no right to make demands to your backers for your failure. Either produce the refunds as requested, or produce the styluses we backed. Backerkit was post funding and are straight purchases that have nothing to due with Kickstarter. What about refunds for backerkit extras that were never delivered? If others are getting a refund, I certainly want one too. In the full amount. $65.00. Bravo Jon, B R A V O. You have brought this experience to ever new lows. We haven't heard from you since August of 2015, and the first thing we hear back is that you want to ransom my refund to remove any comments from kickstarter. You do not even do this on the Kickstarter website via a semi-public project update, but through the email in the hopes that people would not see it happening. Well Jon, I have a counter-offer for you. If you tell us what happened to this, the Storm-Tag and the aClock projects, and as well STOP selling these products through your hex3 website, I will remove my comments. But until you ensure that you are no longer accepting new purchases for any of the products which you are obviously no longer going to provide people, and have provided those people who ordered through your site an answer to why they will never receive their products and can also not receive a refund, I will not remove my comments. Your call. I have very little expectations at this point, as I feel my comments are more valuable on this site, making others aware of this situation, if even in a small way, than to remove them just for a refund.

Jon, Since you announced this project, we've seen the Apple Pencil at the same price as what I pledged to you. When is the YuFu coming out? If it's not going to be within the next quarter, I'd like my money back so I can go spend it on the officially sanctioned pressure sensitive and tilt detecting offering Apple has created. - Ryan Q Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill.

(Interestingly enough, guess who else was a backer... Yup, Jon.) Otherwise all we can do is accept that we'll probably never get anything out of this project. But keep applying periodic pressure. I just contacted Kickstarter to "nudge" Jon into providing an update since his last was in August! Jon hates heartbeat updates. But we need to check for a pulse every now and again. I think in my case, after all this time. I'd get more satisfaction out of celebrating the official demise of this project than getting the actual device. *sigh* Never again, pal.

Jon, please be respectful and considerate and give us and F'in update or refund our money. I wonder what has ever happened to Jon, where he is now and what he is doing. No updates, it doesn't looks like we will ever see the pens. I sent a request for a refund some time ago now. I please comply Here is a question why is the name Adam Burck at the bottom of johns profile when you click on him? I want a refund too. Obviously nothing is being done and two years is a bit too much seeing how technology gets updated fast. Not sure if I can ever see my USD99 again. Maybe its not much for most, but its a big deal for me. Kickstarter is a great platform for robbers and conmen, if that's the case. So nice to see we can get robbed online by a site that's supposedly "legit". Since I have my Apple iPad Pro and Apple Pencil now, and Jon Atherton has not confirmed his commitment to completing his project or delivering the products that fulfill his promise... I am formally requesting that Jon Atherton refund my pledge. At this point it is obvious Jon cannot fulfill and/or will not fulfill the promises he made that convinced me to back his project and submit my pledge Kickstarter Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill. These are the terms I understood when I made my pledge. They also do not appear to have any effect so I am requesting my refund her the only venue available to do that. I will investigate legal remedies that might be available since Jon Atherton has fulfilled none of the promised he made still viewable in his solicitation video - <url>"We'll keep your words in mind as we develop and work to improve everyone's experiences here. " you may as well have added "now get lost" It tells me that you are not going to take action against Jon Atherton. What I and all the other backers of the Yufu and Stormtag want is to hear what you intend to do about Jon. Will you take down his opportunity to con more money from backers by advertising 40% off fictitious products? Will you ensure that he cannot try to create new products on Kickstarter? Will you support backers trying to have him investigated by the authorities? Is there any other action that you can take under the terms of the backer agreement? Please, either tell me what action you intend taking or don't bother to reply. Having backed several projects I no longer have any faith in your system. It's great when it works but when someone misuses it then your attitude is, we've got out cut, tough on you. I expected better from you. You make a lot of money and you give people a chance to create something they probably would never have had the chance to create. That's great, but when things go wrong you shrug your shoulders. From Kickstarter Hi there, Thanks for taking the time to send us your thoughts. We’re always working to make Kickstarter better, and it really helps to get genuine feedback from members of the community like you. We’ll keep your words in mind as we continue to develop and work to improve everyone’s experience here. Best, Katherine My original email to Kickstarter Why are you still showing this, it should be taken down. Jon Atherton is a conman. He is still adverting this as a product with 40% off! The product does not exist and never will do. Look at the comments. Try to see it from our point of view. You got your percentage but we got nothing. At least make sure he does not try to fund any future products and close the site in case anybody pays him more cash for a nonexistent product. Make an effort to show the backers you are on there side. Ok we have lost our money but at least you could try and show some support. Kickstarter is a total fraudulent disaster, Jon just uses this platform for his fraudulent means. My proof: Yufu project Stormtag project Both projects he communicated through the duration of, just about until the time in which he actually had to provide some product. Then he disappears, and Kickstarter does nothing about this behaviour. I would love nothing more than to see both Jon and Kickstarter held financially and legally accountable for activities such as this. Hex3 = Fraud! I want a refund. As Todd L.

That's one project many people with previous experience on Kickstarter would actually like to see." This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. Hey Jon, where are your threats of legal action now? I remember, when you used to call your backers trolls for even mentioning something bad about this project. I even remember when people used to support you, but we haven't seen those people around for a while. Now look at this place. It is obvious to EVERYONE that YOU are in fact the troll here, and most likely a con-man guilty of fraud. Too bad you don't have what it takes to step up to all of these people and admit this project is a failure. I guess it takes someone with a conscience to do that. @Wrae Wene : This is a computer generated reply from Kickstarter. I send also mail for another project to Kickstarter and got exactly the same reply. Just the name was Gary and not Maren. I replied to the mail and again received the same text as reply. There is no real support by Kickstarter. There are only bots replying to user submitted mails. It seems like Kickstarter itself is a scam when it comes to problems with some projects. All the "photos" are obvious computer renders. No images of a tangible product have ever been presented. If you really want to do something, submit a report to an Australian agency such as: <url>"Hi there, Thank you for following up with us about the status of this project. I’m sorry you’ve been experiencing these issues with communication. We've reached out to the creator with a reminder of their obligations to their backer community, and have forwarded along your concerns and those of your fellow backers. While we're disheartened that they have not yet updated backers on the status of their project, we're unable to force them to do so — it's the creator's responsibility to communicate and complete the project as promised. Backing a project on Kickstarter is an expression of trust and can help lead to the creation of new and exciting things. But it’s important to remember that sometimes complications arise that might prevent a project from unfolding as planned — or from happening at all. This certainly isn’t ideal, but we hope that creators and backers will try to communicate with each other through these developments. Although we are unable to offer refunds, we are constantly working to improve the vetting process for creators and thank you for sharing your experience. We hope you’ll continue to be an active member of the Kickstarter community as we learn and grow. Best, Maren" Oh boy, I remember when I backed the Nova. It took a really long time to ship, also, and still I never got my unit. Never. It was never sent to my address. And still, I backed the Yufu. I don't think I will ever see even the tracking code for it on my email. Well, me and almost 2000 backers. This is simply stupid. That's why Kickstarter is dying: because of scammers, shit projects and devs that never finish their projects. Well I have kept hoping that something would come to fruition if I waited long enough, but sadly it hasn't happened. I backed Jon for his Nota stylus and he delivered on that but I backed the YuFu, his Storm Tag and his Clock , all of which hasn't seen the light of day. I have received many emails exhorting my to purchase another product from his Hex 3 site but why would I if he cannot deliver to his backers on Kickstarter. I have given up on Kickstarter, I have backed many projects and they all delivered, not always on time, but they delivered and kept me informed which is something Jon hasn't done. Jon must think that we are suckers who are an easy touch for funds and I am ashamed that he is from my country but then saying that, I have always had a suspicion that Queenslanders are different from the rest of us Aussies, lots of con men live in that state, the Gold Coast is full of them. I doubt that I will ever see this product, or the Smart Tag and because of this, I don't even look at other Kickstarter projects. I have no faith in any of them. Cheers Frank Update? It has been a long while... The FTC has a "Complaint Assistant". Link is <url>#&panel1-1 Cliff carder, I wonder how we go about filing an FTC complaint. I think I'll look into that this morning. If this doesn't qualify then I don't know what does. Jon logged in yesterday and appears to be back from his well earned Xmas break and is soonever to announce that he has at long last "perfected" the Yufu! It probably means he's been enjoying a well deserved holiday from all his hard work in getting the Yufu "perfected" and finally we will get our rewards in 2016! Only TWO years later than scheduled... Jon Boy has not logged into this site since Dec. 21st! Does this indicate that it is a scam? Happy new year!!!! Any bets we will see this thing in 2016? Rene, Jon rarely responds to any reasonable request. He usually only responds after several followup message when the person becomes increasingly irritated ... and then abuses them for not being nice. Terence, sadly this appears to be true. Easy money for such people who abuse the goodwill that motivated many, including me, to support. Haven't backed another Kickstarter project in Tech since this load of crap began to unfold. For the record, I'll now demand a full refund too. Don't hold out much hope for it, but I'll join the chorus of others expecting it now and who have no interest or use in this over-promised and absurdly over-due project. Crowd funding is being used as a playground of scammers I have just reported this project to Kickstarter I would like to have a refund, contacted you about it Mar 27 2015 about a refund, but you never bother responding Happy New Year Jon. <url>"pre-order" link on their website for a product we all know will never be shipped. Time to report both of them here:- <url>"Remember to be respectful and considerate" <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill.") and your inability or lack of desire to fulfill your commitment, I officially request a refund of those funds I invested. Your obligation to me will only terminate upon full refund of those monies. You were unable or unwilling to satisfactorily fulfill your obligation. You can send my funds to the shipping address on file where you promised to deliver a working Yufu Pro stylus that you have failed to produce. I have requested through this forum that you confirm your to the project and show video of a working prototype. You have done neither. I have given up all hope. I cannot afford to invest any more effort in an attemp to get you to do the right thing. stevendphilbrick @Steve P: Jon Atherton is probably getting some legal experience right now. Specifically in regards to contract law when dealing with financial partnerships and Japanese ski resort real estate investments. It doesn't help us in any way, either in completing this project, or in knowing his legal responsibilities when he started his two Kickstarter projects. It just might help him with future contracts he is involved in. The aClock project, now there is one project that screams for legal ramifications. Thankfully, I didn't involve myself further with Hex3 than just this project. I do wonder at how Kickstarter can consider themselves a charitable organization with such examples of fraudulent behaviour that they profit from. The sad truth is that Hex3 and Kickstarter are the only examples of grossly fraudulent organizations I have been associated with is a long time. I do hope that this web page and the Kickstarter Storm Tag page stay on-line and are high enough in search results that people who are thinking of buying ANYTHING from Hex3 see that nothing they offer on their site is actually real. Coming up on two years. Anyone here have any background in law? "I recently successfully funded the Nota Stylus and the YuFu Stylus on Kickstarter" then went completely off the radar, never to be seen again? Fraud: is deliberate deception to secure unfair or unlawful gain. Fraud is both a civil wrong (i.e., a fraud victim may sue the fraud perpetrator to avoid the fraud and/or recover monetary compensation) and a criminal wrong (i.e., a fraud perpetrator may be prosecuted and imprisoned by governmental authorities). The purpose of fraud may be monetary gain or other benefits. Jon is a chicken that can't even step up and discuss the status of this project. The only word to describe what Jon is doing here is FRAUD! This is not a case of crowdsourcing gone wrong. Jon is actively selling these products on the Hex3 web site and has no intentions of following through. This is clear and deliberate fraud. If the manufacturing process is still causing a problem at this point, it can only be because the design is horribly flawed. Somehow, it is now early December 2015 What exactly has been happening with production over there? So Jon, it looks like your backers patience has completely run out and a class action is imminent which is ironic after all your threats to sue for libel. Anything to say? Hello, This is not the first project I'm backing. In fact it was my 15th project. All but one project were succesfull (I'm not including this one). Four other projects are still in development. The idea behind crowdsourcing is to help to start new product or project that might not happend otherwise. Therefore, there are a lot of risk and this is not a "purchase" of a product. Not receiving a product in that case can not be considered fraudulent when people work hard and in good faith... And sometimes something go wrong and they stop... But they say so and why. It's a learning experience. Loosing money in that contect it's fine with me. Clearly, we are not in the same situation here. When you see a group or someone not delivering a product and keep advertizing to get more and more sales.... Even stating that some product were delivered... And worse, creating new crowdsourcing project with the same modus operendi.... It's called a fraud from my point of view. I already made a complaint to Kickstarter and I'm about to make another one to the authorities. If Someone already made one, please sent the case number so I can joined my complaint with yours. Thanks. John is a scam artist and Hex 3 is total BS who wants to bet that we - backers - will hold this one on our hand before 2020 - it's only 5 years away after all? Love it - replace "faster" with "slowest ever in the history of time". "We have engaged new contractors to assist us with faster delivery and expect to ship all new products in Q1 2015." <url>� You gotta have balls... his LinkedIn page says this "I recently successfully funded the Nota Stylus and the YuFu Stylus on Kickstarter." which I guess is correct. Maybe it should say "I recently took a lot of money from very nice people and never gave them anything in return." I just read the article that indicated by Just Sturgis and I was really worried. Kickstarter is concerned with the reputation of anyone planning to do a project? If not, it's easy to receive a management fee and let people exposed to anyone ... Like others, I am waiting. Please, give some information about the project. Thank's in advance. Stop sending me emails Jon for more of your 'products' - including the YuFu!!! Do the right thing by your backers. It's our support and hard earned cash that has supported you these last 2 years. We've been patient many times over. Stop arseing about and get the product out to backers. I design furniture and managed to design, develop, source suppliers and get manufactured 3,200 electric sit-stand desks in 5 months! It's not beyond the wit of man to develop the electronics in your pen and get into production in over 2 years! I honestly think Jon no longer cares about the Yufu, Stormtag, or aClock projects. I honestly feel that he has gotten his money from us, and continues now just to try and keep revenue coming in from the Hex3.co site. I am sure if Jon had anything useful to say he would have said it. I see that he log's onto the site every few days, but since we are months since our last update, other then veiled threats of legal action, I can honestly feel Jon has given up on this project. He probably finds it humorous that we are still logging into the site just to ask for updates, or refunds that he has no intention of honouring. I wonder if Hex3 has any honour at this point at all Besides, look at the latest screen shots from the last update. There isn't even any fine tip attachment being shown anymore, and there are no updates on useable apps that this will work with. Even if the Yufu is delivered, it looks like it won't be anything more than a pressure sensitive stylus like all the others on the market to date. Hex3 = Total SCAM Time to start social media campaign. I'm going to start complaining on twitter to see if that will get some attention for a refund. Thanks Todd. What it doesn't specify though is how long the creator has to fulfil his obligations before a refund should be given. Jon, will we be getting a Yufu in our Xmas stockings this year or has this become the soonever* project that most backers have feared? *something promised but never delivered. Cliff, one differences is that the Zano was launched after Kickstarter changed their terms. Jon is still held to the older KS terms which state "Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill." Jon when can we see a demo of the working electronics? It's been 3 months since the last update. Are you able to fulfill our rewards? Interesting article but sadly the conclusion is "backer beware". <url>"Stormtag" ) and there is this thing : <url>"Orders placed today will ship soon". Funny, that's what it said in the promotional email in July 2014 that I got suckered into buying a second stylus. A new Aussie slang word added to the dictionary accredited to Jon Atherton. SOONEVER; definition - something that is promised but never delivered. Any last bit of excuses, Jon? John I think we are past the point of waiting for any updates or actually seeing a finalized product. As per the kickstarter terms use from when the project was funded. "Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill." I would like my money refunded as this is beyond a reasonable delivery date. Not a peep, a this point the geologic time scale seems quicker than Jon... Still need to change my address.... Re: # Olivier Yoshitomi on October 29 "This is not his first Project, he did a pressure sensitive stylus for iPad before and there where similar posts about delays and lack of communication, that seems to be his way... But hey he delivered eventually and it was a great product! There was quite a struggle with the iPadAir2 display tech that rendered most bluetooth styli unusable for nearly a year, that probably contributed to the delay in development... And even the shadows of the hype about the upcoming Apple Pencil, the YuFu is going to be far superior to it (albeit i really love the idea of charging the pen over the iPad's lightning port...) Well... being frustrated about all the delays, i still prefer a great product instead of a rushed compromise." I don't believe Jon entered into this project with any idea other than providing the stylus he described to the backers and promised to deliver. And, subsequently, making a ton of profit in the retail channels from sales of that product. Many backers shared this dream demonstrating its viability. The most recent communications from Jon talk of a multi-pronged dilemma slowing or stopping progress to the objective of delivering the finished product to the backers:: 1) Jon is almost ready to deliver but has used all of the money getting to that point. Logistical problems still exist. 2) Apparent lack of motivation to proceed to completion by Jon as he weighs possible reward against required effort and additional monetary investment necessary is troublesome. Olivier Yoshitomi brought up many valid points. Unfortunately, the confounding problem that has gotten us to where we are now is a lack of full commitment by Jon to do whatever is required to bring this campaign to fulfillment. How about it John? Can you do it? Despite all the negativity, do you have the fortitude and financial resources to bring this project to fruition? You might also consider posting a current video of a working prototype that must exist by now. I will wait until two full years have passed for my pledge fulfillment before for legal reasons asking for a full refund of that pledge. If the motivation, resources and effort required are not there to deliver the product that was promised, do not wait to send my check to the address I gave to send the stylus. I am still there, still waiting. <url>"HEX3, if you are listening, please return our emails!" This is in reference to the fact they updated all other stylus' SDK's and not the HEX3. So even if Yufu doesn't work, the Jaja might not work either. HEX3 hasn't even updated their SDK's for their previous products, forget that Jon hasn't confirmed ANY app on ANY device will work with the Yufu. I feel bad for Jon, at least on the aClock project, everyone seems to have just forgotten that product and are not bugging him like this one and the Storm Tag. Jon's last statement on the aClock project is the following: Further comments should be directed to our blog or customer service sites. This discussion is now locked due to spam. And as far as I can tell, there isn't any spam, just people asking Jon questions about delays and problems after he took $40K of their money. He basically closed the project, locked the comments section, and removed all trace of the aClock from HEX3 web site. An aClock google search only brings up the project page. Plus when you go to the HEX3 page for the Yufu, there are no mentions of the stretch goals from this project, and absolutely no confirmation that Yufu will work with ANY app on ANY device. I bet Jon wishes he could lock this comment section like the aClock project at tilt.com: <url>"Let it go." I dont understand i keep messaging and posting in the comments - and havent heard a response - PLEASE REFUND my money - 2 years tooo late! Talking of "soon", here are some very apt lyrics from How Soon Is Now by the Smiths.. When you say it's gonna happen "now" Well when exactly do you mean? See I've already waited too long And all my hope is gone Soon, it's all relative to the perception of the writer.

I hope you're right all right chaps. My point is James that with 5 x the amount originally required to perfect the finished product, we have yet to even see what progress has been made. This is not his first Project, he did a pressure sensitive stylus for iPad before and there where similar posts about delays and lack of communication, that seems to be his way... But hey he delivered eventually and it was a great product!

Well... being frustrated about all the delays, i still prefer a great product instead of a rushed compromise. @charles They are clearly marked as pre-orders, and genuine delays don't make someone a "scammer". A lot of projects get delayed and still deliver eventually. What's the point? Cliff, in his defence, just cause he got 5 time more money, he still has to produce more styluses to give to backers etc its not just extra cash to pocket or anything I neeeeeeed to change my address please $141,173 pledged of $25,000 goal. It would be nice to know how Jon managed to spend all of the money without delivering the promised product, especially when he received over 5 times the amount he originally thought would be required?!?! Sam... what do you consider proof of a scam? 2 years of no product and still tsking orders? Maybe 3? FTC complaint filled ! <url>"late September" shipping date on the Hex3 website. Glad they removed that at least... Whoever runs that Facebook group needs to stop calling him a "scammer" unless there is proof - stick to the facts. This user's account has been deleted. Does anyone else notice that Jon logs into Kickstarter and backs other projects... but can't even send an update. His last login was the 21st of October. WTF. I wish he would send me the parts to stylus... I don't even care if it works. I could just mount it on my wall to make sure I dig a bit deeper before backing a Kickstarter project. "Use this space to cheer the creator along, ask questions, and talk to your fellow backers." Come on Jon, you can do it!!!! Only two years late but if we all had our Yufu in time for Xmas we (well, some of us) might all forgive you for the delay! Jon, any chance you will respond to the numerous requests for a demo video to give us some hope that all is not lost? Fellow backers - do good things come to those who wait or are we all a bunch of suckers?! Guys like Jon Atherton are a real shame to the Kickstarter community. I will post this same message on the page of his other failure: "Stormtag, a bluetooth weather station", due end of 2014. I've backed nearly 80 campaigns and this is the only one that's let me down. Some are late, but my experience is that the vast majority are genuine projects, even If I've been disappointed with quality from time to time. I've written this project off, if it arrives it's likely to go into a drawer now or become something for the kids to play with. two months since last update Show of hands please from the 1,939 backers. Is there anybody left who actually believes they will ever get to hold the "perfected" Yufu in their hands? <url>#%ked by: iPen 2 by Creggle Inc. YuFu: The Stylus Failed ZRRO who've discovered zero communication Thankfully, there have been MANY other projects that delivered and met or exceeded expectations. I guess accepting some lemons, f#%k-ups, and lemons comes with the territory. Jon good luck mate. I think this lot are ready to lynch you or hire some goons to bust your kneecaps. I'll be utterly astonished if you ever deliver. Even more amazed if it works and isn't totally eclipsed by other products. Me, I'm just done caring. Isn't there REALLY any solution for a few good thousands people who were scammed by this so called "entrepreneur" to show him that it's just not acceptable to steal people's money and get away with it? Yes, Mr. Atherton, what you are doing IS THEFT, and it's no other way to frame it. Refund your backers and then crawl somewhere where nobody has heard of Kickstarter! And talking about Kickstarter, I hope you are aware you are accessory to theft by not stepping in against this crook in an attempt put things right! But then again, you pocketed your share of the loot and now you couldn't care less, isn't it? Please refund me my money. Your product is now completely outdated and useless. I would like to have my money back please. YuFu: The (mythical) Stylus (two years later and still not) Perfected. Pressure (mounting from backers threatening to sue the "Creator", who gets very) Sensitive (at suggestions he's a conman and assures us everything will be ) Fine (Here's a) Tip (Never back a Kickstarter project again). Sigh... Ok, giving up now. In fact, after a solid 19 months delay and with Procreate being out, I have no use for this product anymore. Made a final effort and reported the product because of misleading facts in the original project description. Looking at the shown project schedule pic or the associated risks, all of it seems like a big fat lie to me. It sounded (and still does) like the design work had been done and the funds were needed to do the heavy production lifting. And while I appreciate the fact that things can go wrong sometimes and delays can happen, this project is just the mother of all disappointments. Anyway, I am out. Don't care anymore if this stylus actually ever ships or the hell freezes before. @Endroe If you go to the "campaign" tab there is a "report this project" button at the very bottom of the page. Kickstarter probably isn't going to be able to help you though. I hope Jon delivers the updates he promised earlier this week... Quietly changing the "shipping in September" to "shipping soon" is concerning, I wonder how soon is soon after all the delays... Is anyone knows how to report this project to Kickstarter? I could not find the button for it! This is a disaster project ever! Just tell us the truth John. You CANNOT fulfil our reward, give my money back! End of story! How hard it could be? Happy October 2nd, Everyone... Has anyone been able to get a response from @JonAtherton? April 2014 was set as delivery date and now it's October 2015 and now information about when shippment will start to date. There will always changes in the technology but that's no excuse to delay after one and a half year later. So when can we expect to get it at last? Still wondering how to change address :) @Jon Atherton "Hi All, Firstly, the YuFu project is very much alive." I am thrilled to hear this. It is quite reassuring. I still want the Yufu Pro that I backed on Kickstarter. In lieu of that, if a product cannot be delivered, I request a refund. "Secondly, regarding the procreate decision: whilst it's disappointing for you, it is not the end of the world - there are loads of Apps on the Appstore and the YuFu will work with Windows and Android. After reviewing my emails back and forth with Procreate, I found the tone of the Procreate comments to be more than a little surprising. The Procreate decision is ultimately going to impact their customers (you), and that is their choice - if you are not happy about that, discuss it with them - or find a different App." I am not overly concerned with the Procreate decision because if the Yufu Pro device delivers as promised, fences can be mended. "The YuFu is still very much going into production, although I'm waiting on a couple of things to align before I will proceed further (quote negotiations, lead times and so forth). So far, the expenditure on the development of the software, hardware and industrial design for the project is considerably over the funds raised here, but at this stage I intend to use my own resources to fund production. " I suspected long ago the funds raised here had dried up. That is of no relevance. What is relevant is that we still do not have a full commitment that quote negotions are being pursued, manufacture begun and Yufu Pros shipped. We pledged our money. In turn, YOU pledged a working product. As I requested before, we deserve a video of the working prototype being used. Not just old still pics being reposted... but, a working video of what you are ready to obtain quotes for production to manufacture for us your backers and the people you have presold the product to on your website. "Just like many of you, I am keen to see the Apple Pencil, and if the iPad Pro allows us extra opportunity. With the release of that device imminent, it's going to be interesting to confirm that the YuFu will work on the screen. Obviously the iPad Pro tech could appear in future iPads of smaller size, and it's usually only a small tweak to make sure the electronics can be adapted for new screens" I am also keen to see the iPad Pro and the Apple Pencil. I cannot fathom how this should effect completion of the Yufu Pro. The technology of the iPad Pro (and if that is adapted to future iPads) should open new horizons to a working Yufu Pro device that fulfills the promises made in the original Kickstarter Project and elsewhere: <url>#kickstrter_disappointment.. <url>"15 hour only" promotions today... I am guessing it still works and people are buying products that will never ship. Jon, obviously, has no problem dealing with the complaints here.. I wonder: What if Jon made an honest appeal to backers saying something like " i tried.. spent all the funds and failed .. sorry".. would we feel swindled as we do now? Such an appeal will obviously close the door on sending promos and hoping to make a few more bucks from unsuspecting backers. Sigh.. Hex3 Limited is moved to Hong Kong? Creators may be sheltered by the Kickstarter from claims of the backers. but Do Keep in Mind that selling somethings which do not exist or by misrepresentation is a real crime. What?!? When did Hex3 move from Australia to Hong Kong? Or did you always have an office here? I do find myself in a curious situation here. Whilst I have totally given up all hope of actually reviving a yufu stylus I do find I'm now getting value for money out of Jons updates. We get the standard 'Yufu is amazing but ooo few teething issues' statement by Jon. Followed by lots of justified complaints by backers and then Jons collection of excuses and threats. It's almost like a little Kickstarter pantomime. Anyway roll on apple pencil. I am confused. Is this project done? If not why are you selling it on your website?

It sounds like production hasn't started and the Kickstarted funds are gone. If this is true, how long has this been apparent? Blaming backers' negativity as an excuse not to communicate with them is unprofessional. It may be difficult for you but it's necessary and simply the right thing to do. Perhaps in the future you may want help in the customer relations side of things as it is not your strong suit. I've been involved in other delayed crowdfunding campaigns and delays don't always mean negativity if they are handled well. I want my money back The pre-order website said "orders placed today will ship soon" but not October or November Quotation has not been confirmed Production has not been started yet Jon said there is a couple of things to align before Jon will proceed further (quote negotiations, lead times and so forth which should have been resolved two months ago according the the update). So far, the expenditure on the development of the software, hardware and industrial design for the project is considerably over the funds raised and "at this stage" (at the moment he wrote up the update) he "intend" (just intended and no decision) to use his own resources to fund production. I cannot see any clue Why are you giving better deals out compared to the ones the original backers were offered? "...but at this stage I intend to use my own resources to fund production." --- "Wow, just wow." "Can you believe this guy." Oops, I mean thanks Jon! That gives us enormous comfort. Thanks again. You're awesome. Any idea when your private funds will be available? And consequently when we will see the Yufu? Never mind. It's the thought that counts here. @Jon Would you name some iOS drawing apps that will support the YuFu? Also, if you told Procreate you could not update your SDK ahead of the iOS 9 release then it is no mystery about why they were unhappy and had to drop support. I agree Procreate's update note is a bit sad though, I doubt JaJa users are rejoicing over the news. Huh? Actually Jon, I can type quite fast, but it seems you only know how to copy and paste "canned" responses instead of answering questions. Yes Jon, you are the victim here. Poor Jon. This is YOUR project! aClock was YOUR project Stormtag is YOUR project YOU are in charge of these projects YOU are not providing products or updates YOU are in charge of selling these undelivered products on your website YOU are not providing proof of the Stormtag and Yufu products YOU have constantly misled us regarding project activities YOU have constantly mislead of regarding delivery dates YOU have treated your customers badly YOU no longer have a relationship with Procreate when they somehow managed to have Apple as a happy customer, and work with Adonis, Wacom, and other stylus manufactures without problem (and still somehow seem to think the problem is them by calling them Tasmanians) But somehow in your mind, we are to blame and you are the victim. All we have is this simple web site to complain about all of these failures of YOURS. I feel bad for this people who bought your products directly, and do not even have this web site to complain about all of this to you. But you are the victim here. YOU are not the victim, YOU are the problem! Procreate news makes me sad :( <url>"We have a working prototype and will be entering production after the campaign," to design problems, then to design problems on top of design problems. For the first 11 months I was okay waiting -- delays happen, especially with technology products. At that point I had given up hope that this sham of a product would ever see the light of day. If it had arrived in my mailbox, oh cool, I guess I was proven wrong and I'm okay with admitting when I've made a mistake. But we're inching closer towards the two-year mark for the campaign starting, and still nothing. On top of that Procreate, one of the main apps I used on the iPad *back when I used to use my tablet for art* no longer wants anything to do with you. At this point I really have no use for the stylus. I have a Wacom tablet and a PC I can draw with, and I can hook up the tablet to a laptop to draw on the go. The YuFu is absolutely worthless to me now. I don't even want one at this point -- what the heck am I supposed to do with it? Try to give it as a gift? What point is there with that when easily one of the best iOS art apps no longer supports anything Hex3? As for the TVTropes reference, you act like we didn't (and still don't) have good reason, when the closest we've come to seeing a working stylus are pictures of the non-electronic version. This joke got old December of last year, and I'm not laughing anymore. I'd love to even get half of what I spent on this vaporware back, but I know that's a pointless desire, and not how KickStarter works. Also correct me if I'm wrong but you are now delaying further so you can test on new iPad? So when new tech comes out each year will it be delayed for testing :/ I'm moving house - how do I change delivery ?!?!? Almost word for word in the Stormtag project which strangely enough is running months behind! Just another stall. @jon, you know what will stop the firestorm of negativity, and the overall frustration and angst many people here feel??????? Videographic or photographic proof that the Yufu exists beyond simple mock-ups which you should have had two years ago, and an actual ship-date we can believe in. If you are near to quote negotiations, or lead time agreements, then you MUST have a final product in hand which means you can show the unit off with each of the promised tips, as well as with app integration with each of the environments as promised. Failure to provide this level of proof means the onus is on YOU for the mood and feelings around for you and Hex3 in general. You are 100% in control for how your customers see you and your organization, and not us. You are in control of how Hex3 works with your partners such as the developers at Procreate. Just refund my money! :-) interesting @Jon With the news that Procreate will no longer be supporting any Hex3 products. I now feel I have been Conned. I have waited patiently for any news that you have sent our way of what is going on with the product. I know that it is not easy to bring a product to market. It DOES take time to get a product just right and I still hope that you do but I have come to the end of my support for you. Sure, I wasn't defending you with posts but I didn't want to bring you down with negative comments. I have to say, now that the only app I would have used the YuFu on will not be supporting it, shame on you. Keeping a good relationship with the app developers has nothing to do with what we are posting on Kickstarter. You should have already had a good team for your other products that have nothing to do with this project. Procreate writes "This is only the latest in a series of partnership issues we’ve had with Jon and Hex3, dating right back to the first implementation of the JaJa. Hex3 have proved over the years that they are not a reliable or productive business partner". Unlike the set backs we have had with this project I see no reason why this aspect of your business couldn't have been addressed before they pulled the plug. I don't know if you just don't have a good team behind you or you are taking too much on yourself but somethings got to change. Hire a Public Relations employee to handle the backlash and help repair bridges. If you can't afford to do that then hire a part time worker to take pictures of development of your products and post them online. Kids in high school can do this for super cheap. Albert Einstein defined Insanity as "doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results". @jon, can you name one app for each of the iOS, Android, and Windows platforms this product will be supported on, that will have full compatibility with, and that your organization has been working with the ensure full SDK integration? I do not see this information in the Hex3 website, and if you are moving into the final production stages, I would think the app integration component should be, if not close to, almost complete. A pressure sensitive stylus with no app integration will not be worth anything, if it only behaves as an expensive dumb-stylus. Thanks for the update Jon. All I want to know is why do you keep on changing the shipping date when you evidently don't have a finished product? We have been waiting nearly two years for your "perfected" stylus and understandably, patience in running thin. It is demoralizing to move from the enthusiasm of backing an innovative project to finally realizing that it is likely dead. In the first year I had corresponded with Jon directly to reassure him that, although people were voicing their unembellished concerns, there were still plenty of us who preserved faith in him. At that time I felt a small sense of fulfillment in believing I was above the retort so many had early on. Now I realize what a sucker I am and how easily I can be conned. I tip my hat to those of you who smelled the stench of deceit early on. I wish I possessed that level of insight. I don’t. And even now I’m pathetically optimistic that a Yufu will arrive with support from the apps we use most; namely Procreate. Conversely, considering the ethical nature of the Procreate team in producing cutting-edge apps and upgrades that really work well, if they have finally pulled the pin on Hex3 altogether, it seems that this really has turned into a debacle and fraud. On another level, we should realize that apps like Procreate depend on good third-party tools to give their customers a great experience. I’m sure severing relations with any stylus-maker is a big concern of theirs. And as stated by others, even with a fully-functioning Yufu it won’t perform to its potential without an app to use it on. I’ve emailed Jon a number of times since June and haven’t received a response. I’ve also emailed their customer service people. The messages have either been ignored or bounced back undeliverable. I am upset about losing money, but am more distressed about being taken advantage of; particularly when I pledged so much support and encouragement to Jon personally. I’m moving on now but just wanted to post this first and final note. I will not participate in any future Kickstarter projects. There are simply too many people in this world that use clever tactics to hurt others. To volunteer my resources to Kickstarter without any recourse or intervention from them is insane. I agree with all of your points, Raphael. Jon, it's clear by your Kickstarter profile that you visit the site regularly. How about an honest update of the situation? Without Procreate support I honestly have zero interest in the product anymore, but I would like to hear where my money ended up. You owe us that at least. I've tried to be positive and give the benefit of the doubt, as many Kickstarters get delayed and have trouble producing, and I own one of your previous products. But your lack of communication has made this an incredibly frustrating experience for your backers. At this point, I don't consider a full refund. But an honest feedback and update specially considering such an important release like apple pencil. When I decided to back this on kickstarter I imagined there were risks involved. However I got really frustrated specially with the lack of consideration, updates and feedbacks the founder of the company had with the backers. And given all this talk, I honestly think that this project is dead. It would be an honorable thing for Jon to just update us on that and prove that he spent all of our money trying to make this viable and that he was unfortunate on the endeavor. And in case there is still money from the backers left, it would be the right thing to refund us with the reminiscent resources of there's still any. I have refrained to post anything for nearly two years, loosing confidence and patience bit by bit. Never again i will be funding any project through kick starter. What would be the best way to organize a lawsuit or to file criminal charges for theft? I don´t know if this has already been posted. Some suggests reporting him to interpol in each country where backers are for the australian office to take action. Can anyone in Australia confirm this?. "@jonny.cohen I contacted Interpol in Australia. And they advised that every backer (or scammed buyer) in each country should contact their local Interpol office to lay a charge against him. These would then be forwarded on to the Australian office where they can hopefully give Mr. Atherton the set of matching bracelets he has rightfully earned" <url>#msg66692 Your product description needs updating now Procreate have given up on you: <url>"Many modern artists have chosen the iPad as their medium, and combined it with brilliant Apps like Procreate to shape their art. The YuFu is designed to work perfectly with all of the best Art, Note Taking, Ideation and Animation Apps, as well as to work with all Tablets that support Bluetooth LE." No more Procreate support means no use for this stylus. So I take it we won't receive any sort of refund? (talking to the other backers) @jon atherton, good job buddy (slow clap). In the course of just over a year you have used two different third party web sites, as well as your own to facilitate your long-con game. Based on this announcement from Procreate, I can no longer assume anything you say regarding this project is truthful. I would ask for my money back, but we all know a con man never gives his spoils back. I backed this project based on your previous history with the Jaja, and I have learned from this experience. For one, I will tell all those I can about how your financial backers were treated through this, the stormtag, and the aClock projects, and make sure i can educate as many on your "business methodologies". Secondly, I have learned to stay as far from Kickstarter as possible. Seeing how we are customers of kickstarters, and how they have provided us no protection or course for reconciliation, I will never purchase any product through this site. To Kickstarter, I hope the pittance of profit you made here was worth losing a long term customer. To Jon, I can only hope to be part of a class action suite that is brought against you for failing to deliver what was promised as part of this project. You took my money through deceit and forgery, and sold your name for a couple hundred thousand. I would like my money back this is bullshit From Matt at Procreate: "Hey guys, Procreate will no longer be supporting any Hex3 products. As we stated in our latest update post, we’ve reached out to Jon Atherton numerous times to request an iOS 9 compatible SDK, and we received no response. Because of this, as of 2.3.1 Procreate will no longer support the Hex3 JaJa. This is only the latest in a series of partnership issues we’ve had with Jon and Hex3, dating right back to the first implementation of the JaJa. Hex3 have proved over the years that they are not a reliable or productive business partner, and we have now contacted Jon and officially severed ties with the company. Even if the YuFu does emerge, we will not be supporting it or any other Hex3 products." Given that Procreate is one of the biggest art apps in the iOS App Store, this is a serious blow. I've tried to be optimistic about the stylus being released, but with Procreate, the main art app I use, dropping support for all Hex3 products going forward, I'm giving up on getting the stylus. If the stylus shows up in my mailbox one day, that's fine, but I'm not holding out hope any longer. Everyone in this comments section is just talking to themselves, he clearly isn't reading them and has no intention of completing the project as we near the two year mark, chalk it up to a failed investment, I claimed the amount back in my tax return last year , life is short, I'm forgetting about this scam and moving on, good luck all From the original promotional video on the Kickstarter Yufu Project Page: "We've completed the electronics design and have working electronic prototypes. The design is complete. And, what you see in these prototypes requires very little adjustment before production." Jon, please either recommit to your original vision and promise to deliver. The tool is still needed and desired by many. Show us a time stamped video of the good things (as well as the hurdles still to be overcome) with your latest prototype. Show us you are still dedicated. Or, man up and give us your reasons for not moving forward to completion. We entrusted you with our hopes, dreams and financial support. As backers of this project, we deserve no less than what you pledged. thanx I haven't said much throughout this campaign bc I always offer the benefit of the doubt when it comes to "kickstarting" a project but It's piercingly evident, Jon has abandoned this campaign, in all aspects. Based on his past campaigns (the nota, in particular) I am NOT surprised. I'm an extremely sanguine and forgiving human, but in this case, I do hope there is a hell that Jon can rot it. With that said, there is nothing more to say on my end. It's a lesson learned and I hope everyone here will be able to swallow the bullet and move on. Pieces. In the original campaign it lists the location as Wilmington DE so one would think that US laws would apply to this campaign. He also listed at one point that it would be shipped out of US locations. Again doesn't doing business mean you must abide by certain laws in the US? What I'm most concerned about right now is that Jon does not appear to be communicating with app developers. The guys at Procreate stated they've reached out to him several times concerning updates to the Hex3 SDK and Jon has ignored them each time. Procreate was forced to drop support for the JaJa in the upcoming version 3 because of this. I have tried to stay optimistic during this, but that really sets alarms off in my head. Jon, I had asked you to reaffirm your commitment to this fundraising project 4days ago. You still have not let us know what is going on and what your intentions are. We obviously could benefit from an update but that will not let us know if you will continue to see this through to sucessfully fulfilling the commitment you made to Kickstarter and to all of your backers. The updates to this point have promised impending delivery several times. It is now time for Jon to publically provide his response. Previously, I had also asked for a video of the working Yufu Pro prototype. It is time for a response instead of a promotional updates. thanx When!? Jon, remember when you first told us in a video how wonderful this stylus would be? How about you make another one with a full and honest update please? Me: "On the main page of the project there is a link to 'order now' linking to a fradulant external site. Kickstarter can hide behind it's TOS but directing people to fraudulent activity should be taken down immediately." Kickstarter: "If you spot something you’d like to bring to our attention, the easiest thing to do is use the “Report this project” button at the bottom of each project page. We have a dedicated Integrity team that reviews concerns about projects on the site, so they’ll look into this." Slow clap, Kickstarter can't forward a support request to another department. We can at least get the implicit support of further fraud taken down. Come at me Jon- I 'bought' aClock- this is me being respectful. The comments of the Stormtag backers can be references for the Yufu backers to assess their own positions here... guys, let's sue him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Court orders restitution, fines in first-ever victory against a delayed Kickstarter <url>#comment-10997561 For backers: Just change the names and fill in the blanks. apple pencil guys... this product just became obsolete and my guess is that he will just quit the project... at this point a refund would be not feasible I'd guess... huge disappointment with this company, it's founder and the whole way this project was managed back from the first presentation... sad. Obviously Jon is too busy in counting money from selling products that don't exist. Up next he's going to tell to shut up and wait... Same procedure as every few months,,, When exactly can you ship my backer order? I have waited for 2 years! Jon. I bet you are relieved that Apple's Pencil will only work on their new iPad Pro so at least you still have a marketable product for people who don't want to shell out for a new tablet. Please just tell us what the hell is going on. The iPad Air I bought specifically to use with my "perfected" Yufu stylus is now almost 2 years old!! I just wonder if you will finally admit that taking on so many different projects at once rather than focussing on the Yufu was a mistake? This really is a disappointment. If it is possible to ship my YuFu Backer package in Setember (2015) as you promised on your promotional website preorder page, please do that. It could obviate the need to order the Apple products which will cost me $898 plus sales tax and freight. If you refund my money though, I could then afford the keyboard and case for the iPad Pro. thanx again for your continued dedication to this arduous project. Please ship my YuFu Pro backer package in October (of this year) so that I will have a chance to use it for at least a week before my iPad Pro and Apple Pencil arrive. thanx ps - don't forget the fine and brush tips. @Jason Pearson Good one "YuFail" and YuTuLate" lol YuScam, YuFooled us all.. Just took a look at the discussion on Stormtag page here.. Kickstarter is very disappointing for not interfering - Enough evidence for taking action.. <url>Pencil This user's account has been deleted. I think I'll just buy an Apple Pencil. Tech Times, "The upcoming iPad Pro from Apple, meanwhile, is expected to rock a 12.9-inch display with a resolution of 2,732 x 2,048 pixels at 264 pixels per inch, as some iOS 9 beta code suggested. The iPad Pro is also expected to feature Force Touch technology, which entails a pressure-sensitive display that offers different functionality based on how hard a user presses on it." Times, they are a changin' How can you offer this for sale to the public when the backers haven't yet received the YuFu. Given the long past deadline to ship, I believe backers should receive the 2 for 1 deal! Do something to thank those that gave $$ for you to exist! I am trying to confirm that the 1mm tip is still being provided as that was the main reason I backed this project to begin with. New photos are missing the 1mm tip. Disgusting how after almost 2 rates rise that have helped the project get shafted and the ones that haven't helped get 2 for 1. I ordered the artist pack and didn't get close to that good a deal. I'm very much regretting backing this and the stormtag. I have tried to be patient in waiting for this, but it really is frustrating to see 2-1 offers in my mailbox. Please, please, please send me the Stylus I backed. Once I get that, I may well be interested in picking up more with a 2-1 offer, but what is it they say, fool me one shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. Some heated discussion on Stormtag KS site. Lots of good/useful links too. Hi Jon. When can we expect to see working electronics? Thank you. I've got email of discounts buy one get one free, I don't care about it! JON, just send my YuFu please! Why is it that there are discounts for new buyers that are lower in price than the original investors who are still waiting for product for over a year. Jon I wonder what you are doing for your original investors who have been waiting FOREVER. Are they going to get the 2 for 1 deal because of the long wait or is that only for those who purchased during the 15 hour sale period. I find it ironic that I'm receiving more sales discount offers than product updates. Nice going. I got the email from "YuFu Sales" the other day and thought, "Oh, this must be them shipping the styli." To my surprise, I wasn't excited about it. I guess because it's been so long? But then it was just another email to get a discount on a YuFu. Heh heh :P In other news, who else is excited about next week's Apple event?! I'll be so happy if they release a stylus with a thin tip and pressure sensitivity. They could easily steal a huge swath of Wacom's customer base, I think, by releasing a really solid drawing tool. Here's to hoping! anyone seen this pretty cool pen? <url>’s a reminder of what you will get when it ships… but there have been some delays! As you may know, I have several pending patents on our own stylus technology, but to complete my vision and deliver the best product I decided recently to license some additional patents. The details here are confidential but will improve our product. So we made a few small changes to the engineering, and added an exciting new feature which I will reveal soon – I guarantee you will love it :-) In the next week or so, I can confirm the delivery schedule. Jon's words, not mine, posted on Hex3 12th August 2014. Have you diaried in two weeks you will have to change delivery to end of October. please refund my money - this is outrageous - the project is so behind - this is a lost cause. thanks Tick, tock, time spins on the clock. Not today but, maybe tomorrow time moves on and again Christmas is coming. What is the "real expectation" on your deliverables? And what are your current challenges delaying the deliverables to your initial backers? With the original time expectation long gone and the frustration from all sides. Developer, backers, manufacturing, technical implantation, patent applications, and manufacturing NDA's. I believe that everyone involved wants this slow journey to be over. We are all on the bus together which seems to have square wheels creating a very bumpy ride for the passages while the driver says almost there. The look outside the windows is obscured and the driver doesn't update the passengers about the view outside. It is ironic that I keep getting email invitations about buying another bus ticket at a discount. So Mr. Bus driver what is the view outside and when will this journey end for all backer types? Tick, tock, time spins on the clock. Not today but, maybe tomorrow time moves on and again Christmas is coming. What is the "real expectation" on your deliverables?

How much did Hex3 get from presales of undelivering products? Were these presales the commercial orders which Jon had been referring to and said needed to be fulfilled? Jon, Now that you're further along in development, how is the performance of the pens in real world use now that you've got your hands on some production units? - looking forward to using mine! :-) And I just remembered the second stretch goal for this project was for Windows 8 drivers. I see no mention of Windows support on the website. It now only says IOS and Andriod. And you can buy the Yufu cheaper on the website with a 20% discount that pops up, than we paid here. Forget the mailers for 15% off, and the fact that the second stretch goal seems to have been completely removed. Wow, no mention of the aClock on the website anywhere. I wonder how those people who backed that are feeling. I had forgotten about that product, and from the project web site at tilt.com, those people haven't heard from Jon in over a year. I really could not imagine a situation where I would buy a single product or service from Hex3 ever again. I would feel better about this update except we have been shown pictures of a product that Jon had pictures of before he posted this kickstarted campaign. There still is literally no proof of progress with the electronic versions of this stylus. Changed James. Now late September 2015. In the hex3 site it says that the stormtag and Yufu will ship late August. Just a pity he does not say which year! It certainly won't be August 2015. While I agree with those that are more interested in seeing photos or footage of the YuFu Pro. Which I invested in, myself. Everybody on these comments has repeatedly said two things. More frequent updates. And more photos of "anything" related to the project. I think we can give him credit for beginning to take some level of initiative in finally providing some photo evidence that he actually has a stylus at all. hopefully we will be updated soon with that same evidence of the YuFu Pro. I had posted something like this before and read that comment online, before it disappeared. I am not interested in pictures of the YuFu Note, wonderful though they are... in any of its iterations including the soon to be available fine tip. I want to see pictures of a working YuFu Pro prototype with the different tips. That is what I invested in and surely, given the time that has passed, a video of a working prototype is more than overdue. This is the most disingenuous campaign and treatment of backers I have seen to date... No update on electronics. No update on the 4048 levels pressure sensitivity that can be calibrated and adjusted to different curves. No update on the Gyro sensor, No update on the Bluetooth Low Energy. Just some photos of tips and shaft that don’t look that much different than the ones on campaign page published nearly 2 years ago! I don’t really mind that I lost my money on this. What annoys me is the fact that Jon thinks he can treat us like fools. He thinks he can throw us a few scraps in a poorly conceive “update” and silence us for a month or two. Heartbeat stuff! 2 updates in one week! I remember backing this Kickstarter before 9/11. I bought my first IPOD back then and thought this stylus would be neat to have. Thanks for the frequent project updates! I can't wait to have it! I am thinking of :- At one one, if the creator is not going to deliver, why does he bother to keep fighting with the backers and made those "superficial updates" instead of just walking away? How much pre-sale can he get after all these? At the another end, if the creator is going to deliver, why does he yell at the backers or threaten those backers criticizing him here? People will still enjoy working with such a creator/company even though he delivers a fantastic product at last? There will be no business too. So... what's the point? For fun? For business? For Sport? It is weird and I am confused. Be honest, the last update does not seem to be the masterpiece of Jon. I am not expecting Yufu can be delivered at all. Name your bet Terence, I bet that neither the Yufu or Stormtag will be sent out this year. Whats this on your site: The YuFu Pro: Pressure Sensitive, Ultrafine Stylus Features: Buy 1 Get Free StormTag So we are all getting a free StormTag with this now? Another stalling update, old pictures. Stormtag still not sent Out! Waste of time. Click on The "Pre-Order Now!" Button lead to a reset and link to Hex3 website which says that Orders placed today will ship in late August 2015. I am impressed :-) @creator REFUND PLEASE I agree with Jason. Furthermore Jon, posting an article freely available on the internet is NOT libel. Let's not carelessly throw around legal terminology. I also suggest that sending special offers for the item that people are still waiting for is tacky. How about just keeping people updated instead? @jon care to comment on why we only hear from you on comments you deem liabelous but not on those comments asking kindly for updates or for those asking polite questions regarding their technical of financial concerns? Do you not have the ability to see this is why this project is frustrating for so many? There are so many legitimate questions below which go completely unanswered. Can you not treat those who have financially backed you with respect and consideration? Many people have legitimate concerns or questions and we never see answers to those queries. We only hear from you randomly when someone brings up your past legal wranglings, but not when someone asks a direct question regarding the project that they gave YOU money. You say you are tired of the negative comments and those asking for refunds, but then never address nor reply to those who are simply asking for information. It is this lack of customer empathy or understanding which makes me feel confrontational about this project. @creator - just refund my money - i can see by your post below you do read the comments. Is this good news Jon? Just received an e-mail telling me that I have just 15 hours in which to purchase a YuFu at a 40% discount before they ship (received as I was a previous backer I guess). Does this mean we are really, really close? Jon keeps on threatening people and calling them 'stupid'... But I don't think he's got much to go on. Only nibs... I can fully agree Wynn Hlaing and doesn't understand the problems with PCB when I have backed the YuFu Note that works without batteries. Maybe Jon can answer it why this product is also delayed?! But till yet no answer to this question! Even not in private message. I am expecting an update soon following the promotion presales just released :-) My guess is that this is what happened with this project: For many entrepreneurs, Kickstarter is a way to raise small funds which are not enough to produce a product but are valuable evidence for big investors to provide serious funds. If many people backed a project, investors see it as real proof for low risk investment. My guess is that Jon's lawsuit issue <url>"be respectful and considerate" next to the "post comment" button.. I wonder what's written next to the "submit your project" button... Maybe: "if your project is a scam , don't make it too obvious you may be able to raise more money with deceptive email campaigns' :) Since our money is gone we can at least get a few laughs out of this.. any suggestions for a caption next to the submit button Jon clicked? Oh ... and Jon,, Unless you upload a video of a working prototype or have something funny to say, don't bother responding to this.. (the 40% discount email campaign was funny but that was a year ago - not as funny 9th time round) For the most part I try to remain quiet, and just await news like everyone else. But it gets increasingly harder to not just complain each and every day when we get mailed 'discount' offers on a product with news that its 'just about to ship' when we as backers get no news and feedback on something your sales department seems to know about. Deanne nailed it. I've worked in the game industry for 27 years so I know a lot of people that would love this product. I sent the Kickstarter link to everyone on Facebook and Linked-In. I am a little embarrassed that people I talked into investing in this are being subjected to the worst Kickstarter experience they have had. I feel like I owe them an apology. I know on Kickstarter that we fund an idea, we invest in the creator in the hopes that they treat our investment (both monetarist and support) with respect. You Sir have not. I spruked this to family and friends who invested, excited at the prospect of this amazing stylus (which is what, a unicorn now - great to talk about and no proof of existence?), they invested. They are now getting treated like crap. You're passive aggressive attacks against people who criticise your lack of updates (you have our addresses do you sir, what are you planning on doing with them?) shows your lack of skills in the PR department. Your inability to field criticism is a joke at best, but really it's sad. People invested in you because we believed in your idea. We didn't preorder on your site (although I do find it disingenuous that it IS available for preorder when you haven't even finished the damned thing). I know things take time, life happens and technology is a ****. But your lack of communication and then he way you address people when you do communicate is disappointing. I've waited YEARS for kickstarters to finish, long after their due date, but their humble updates and community they developed made it okay. We were vital to the process. Here we are just chattel who gave you some cash to... I assume you'll maybe make a stylus with it. I just wonder if the technology is going to be obsolete before people get a chance to use it. again no shipping update - when is the realistic ETA - maybe people will post nicer things if you keep us in the loop - But lets go further, forget about this. I can't understand you guys, you are leaving here comments for years already, and nobody, especially "The Creator," gives a sh..t about. So go on, it's not the first sting you got. OK, I could have a meal with a bottle of wine in a decent restaurant, Thanks Jon for your detailed reassuring reply. Although I have no interest whatsoever in downloading your app, I did notice it in my daily visit to appshopper and wondered whether another company, Glentwood was copying your app. A quick google confirmed you are associated with Glentwood but the *Real Jon Atherton* post caught my eye. Hence my post to you. On more related matters, how is the testing going? Cheers, Keith It appears while we await the testing report of the contents of the latest plastic bag of parts, Jon Atherton of Glentwood has been busy offering and reducing the price of his once banned app, now named Wobble Premium on the Apple Store. (Something to keep us amused perhaps, while we patiently wait?) Jon, could you please confirm we are dealing with the real Jon Atherton as I wouldn't like to be dealing with the other Jon Atherton as he doesn't seem to be "respectful and considerate" See link:- <url>é Hostombe on July 10 Hi Jon, first of all thanks for the update. I would really be happy if everything went well at the end ;) (crossing fingers). On thing. In you post you said, that the survey should be send out the same day then the post. Did you already send it out? and if yes what should i do if i did not get any. Thanks hey backers check this out: <url>"We have working units and have the experience to deliver." --> "Aha hahaha ha ha ha haaahahahaha ahah ahah ahah ahah hahahaha...sucker!" Hope y'all are having a good Summer/whatever Season it is where you are- I'm kinda thinking I might get the pro I ordered before Christmas comes this year, but not betting money on that! ;~;' SIGH Read and learn @Creator, that's how you should treat your backers. <url>"perfected" perfected Also found in: Medical, Legal, Financial, Idioms, Encyclopedia, Wikipedia. per·fect (pûr′fĭkt) adj. 1.

"Some people in particular seem to forget that this is not an anonymous forum, the comments are all cross referenced with pledges, addresses and phone numbers." -- You threatening us Jon? That's funny. It's all you against the world, aint it? You show us an image of what seems to be the nib-housings. I'd say you got those a year ago or more. At least you should gave. What happened between FINALLY NAILED IT post and this one? Seriously, I have never seen anything like this. Are you in the least surprised that people here are angry and frustrated? This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. Could you please cancel my order and refund my money? Also, could you please cancel and refund my order for the aclock that I backed on tilt.com? I no longer have an iPad and the clock seems to have disappeared from your website, and I assume it will never be built. Jon, be friend, I really wish you succeed with Yufu. It was why I backed your project and also recommended a friend of mine to pre-order it last year. I shall take all back my negative comments if delivery can be made by end of this Oct or if it cannot be made by then, there are good reasons for further delays. No one really want to tear you down here. Thanks for the update, Jon. Can't wait to try this out. Still don't see any other interesting/similar upcoming styluses. can i ask where is my Yufu? if you dont have a yufu then where is my money Also please stop with the rude comments - without this you wouldn't have any product to work on so a little respect would be appreciated. We get this isn't a store - but we expect to see progress as we have helped fund this a had we had more progress updates and images/videos I doubt there would be this much negativity, but from our point of view it does feel like you have done a runner with our money - I hope you understand this Excuse typos - wrote on phone and it autocorrected lol Jon I've not down charge back as I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt. It's just frustrating and hard for us when we do see so little from you yet we get the emails with discounts. Surely you can understand where we are coming from - I get what you are doing is tricky and I doubt I could do better but it's just hard when we have given you money for this. Here's hoping we can hear more good news soon. @Jon Atherton How about an update on AClock somewhere Why next to this person's name is the word "Creator" when in all actuality it should be "Fraudster"?!? Mr. Atherton, you took the money people funded your project with and vanished like a crook into the mist of silence and at best perpetual excuses about why nothing is happening with the product you dangled in front of people to make them reach for their wallets. ALL you should say ay this point is APOLOGISE for the massive inconvenience you have caused with your appalling project management, negligence or downright indifference (it doesn't really matter at this point) and offer the disgruntled backers of this unfortunate project the opportunity to choose having an immediate and full refund. That is if you're not the dishonest swindler a lot of people are more than justified in thinking you are! Hi Jon. I really hope this project is still on course. The main problem most of us have had since the first deadline passed last year are the the lack of credible updates and also in your promotional emails (apart from the last one) stating that the "next" shipment will be by a certain date, but as there hasn't even been a first shipment I'm sure you'll understand why we would find that misleading. Let me get this right... Jon steals our money and then makes threats towards us?! LOL And you too Charmaine LOL I guess the not-so -veiled threat on the update page is directed at you too now Terence LOL!!! LOL got it. Nothing is changing Jon, impress us if you get anything new and positive. Clearly this project is an utter joke and hey we take that risk with kickstarter. Either he is deliberately acquiring money by deception or just a very poor business man. Either way I do think kickstarter should acknowledge this and cancel this 'inventors' account so that others may not fall victim. Jon , would you tell us what is really happening? Jon, would you tell us what is really happening? 18K yufu .......... I was just told that the Brisbane Public Prosecutors Office has been advised of the current situation and as a side point,I was also told the owner of the Nomad Espresso machine was unaware that his invention was being offered for sale on Atherton's website as well. I've just been contacted by a person who, though not a backer, feels that he was ripped off by one of these 40% discount emails some time ago ( of course he hasn't received his goods) and he is getting in touch with his nearest Interpol office. He suggests we all do the same and some kind of result might be had. This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. How can there be a promo mail when it has been almost two years to get the stylus...by one get none just about sums it up. Another promo email just came in : 15 hours only.. <url>"Buy one get one" Should be "buy one get none" ;) KS.. no response or comment?? This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. Oh ROFL!!!!! Shipping in late August 2015, according to the website. YOU NAILED IT!!! no really. seriously? 15 hour promotion sales email of yufu again? Might explain the constant delay due to patent infringement. Probably looking for 'ideas' Can't help but notice that Jon's backed 3 other styluses..... As well as the "plate your apple watch in gold" campaign.... @barryG. No case against KS. Just a disappointment that they have no will or means of protecting backers. wow, I tried to post but I guess it wasn't respectful enough... and mentioned if there was an attorney in the group that could do a class action .. Kickstarter should be held liable... Is there an attorney in the group that can start a class action? Since it's pretty clear that we have all been had. Lets at least have a few laughs about this and maybe spread the word about Kickstarters disappointing conduct. I for one, am not going to back another project here again. #kickstarterscam <url>"Finally nailed it down" for not delivering? Jon? This user's account has been deleted. Well almost two month into the last update. What's new ? Mm, more than a year ago that we all funded Mr. Atherton. Isn't it high time to start another dubious project? The cash from Yufu and Stormtag must have been spent by now ;-) Seems like no one is positive anymore. Dear Rita, I'm really sorry that this didn't work out better. You were such a loyal supporter of Jon and I can only imagine how you must feel with emerging state of affairs and realisation of what that represents. I could only hope for someone like you to be a champion for a cause I was leading. Jon, you are more than 1 year late. Ridiculous.SCAMMER <url>"creator", do we just assume ourselves, the project is dead? I mean, does Kickstarter draw an official line under it....at some stage or is it just left open ended in mid air? Further, whilst I understand the inherent risk in backing this as a Kickstarter project, if it is, dead in the water, surely it is illegal to keep selling it on line. That fact alone still gives me a glimmer of hope that it still might happen. Well, I was concerned about my devices that they may not last or hold up. With technology rapidly changing and having little time before I must replace my hardware, I think the dynamic approach from the team(s) - well they have been caught in the vortex of every circuit changing with new ideas. No one can/will ever be able to keep ahead! My high end devices (1 dead now) will be obsolete by the time the excuses, reasons and detailed plans have been exhausted by this entire team/ or maybe there is no specific team to deal with this disappointing project. Not as if our initial investment was a catastrophe in size, there was just so much 'promise'. Some have a reputation which proceeds them - as this case demonstrates. This person can never be trusted at their 'word' or even their signature! Quid pro quo We had expected, but doesn't work here - obviously.... I truly can't believe that not doing "heartbeat" updates is more important than the overwhelming amount of negative publicity and brand trashing Hex3 is taking on this and the other projects. But I guess only threats of legal action will get us any type of communication from Jon. Just cannot be clearer This is looking more and more like a complete scam. Jon's last update, "After.....100's of ALMOST INVISIBLE design changes we have finalised the 43 parts of the YuFu". Completely invisible! At this point I can't help but laugh at how much of a disaster this project has become. I'd love a refund but well, it's a Kickstarter project so we've all been had. Funny how everything's great so long as we act like good Sheeple and stay in line, but the moment people show frustration with the lackluster updates (if we are even privileged enough to get one!) and year of non-delivery we're detractors and troublemakers. Well, count me as one then. I'm tired of this ride, and at this point my imaginary stylus would be better served going to a would-be customer with more time and patience than I. Had my Jaja stylus failed merely 1-2 weeks earlier maybe I'd have been smart enough not to put any faith in HEX3 or Jon this time around. Oh well, $80 flushed down the toilet. Par for the course. Good luck, YuFu backers. At least the other hyper-delayed project I backed is making progress I can ACTUALLY SEE! Theres enough effort to change the shipping dates on the main hex website, but can it really be so hard just to show us supporters more about whats going on. A picture here and there about the office at work, parts and prototypes, that hardly takes much time to do and would by all means make us feel like things are actually getting done and that we arent waiting on the final puff of smoke to kill this project. @Jason: I asked for a video a few times already but as rude as Jon can be, he ignored all of (repeated) polite and respectful requests. I guess the stylus just don't exist and we just all got scammed. The StormTag backers are just as frustrated... <url>#itm=newscomau%7Chome%7Cnca-homepage-news-plus-story%7C1%7Cheading%7Chomepage%7Chomepage&itmt=1434109937789 <url>"Thank you for the support. We wouldn’t be here without you." Jon, Respectfully, this project below is a perfect example of how we your backers, would expect to be updated.They had some problems too but kept everyone informed along the way... <url>"swindler". He's still trying to deceive poor guys through his spam mails offering big discounts on "nothing" because this product doesn't exist and I think it will never will. I backed up for the ones with no technology so what's the problem to produce a metal barrell with a thick point? Kickstarter should forbid to this guy start any other project!! I am totally going to start a kickstarter for "LIve Dinosaurs engineered from dino DNA extracted from insects!". I mean come on if you never have to ship an actual product why think small like a capacitive stylus? Mars colony? Maybe a fusion reactor? The possibilities of unattainable goals are endless! Lol I bough the expensive limited edition Yufu. Passing the time waiting for this Yufu with a bit of three word haiku and an anagram. Jon, Hate, Torn. Stop moaning and take some action. You've lost your money, you won't ever see a Yufu. Let's find someone in Oz who can report him to the authorities. He got the money, now make him pay the price. @ all guys. I got this standard response from Kickstarter again. Thank you for following up with us about the status of this project. I’m sorry to hear that the creator has not done a better job of communicating. We've reached out to them with a reminder of their obligations to their backer community, in addition to having forwarded along your concerns and those of your fellow backers. While we're disheartened that they have not yet updated you and other backers on the status of their project, we're unable to force them to do so. It's the creator's responsibility to communicate and complete their project as promised. Backing a project on Kickstarter is an expression of trust. Backers pledge in hopes of helping a creator bring their idea to life. This interaction can lead to the creation of new and exciting things, but it’s also important to remember that sometimes complications might arise that prevent a project from unfolding as planned, or even from happening at all. This isn’t ideal for creators or backers, but we hope that both parties will try to communicate with each other through these developments. We’re sorry that this hasn’t been the case with this project, but hope that you’ll continue to back projects that you’re excited about. Thank you again for sharing the experience that you have had with this project. Although we are unable to offer refunds, we are constantly working to improve the vetting process for creators and feedback such as this is exactly what helps us do so. We hope that you’ll continue to be an active member of the Kickstarter community as we learn and grow with our community. Best, Almost as many comments as backers - never a good sign for a Kickstarter project. Looks more and more like a non-starter along with the StormTag.... @Pedro Agree with you Kickstarter may have charged the creator over 20% of the fund raised I have thus far only read the comments and finally I'm posting something.... all I can say is Kickstarter is as much to blame as John, they should refund their portion of the money to all for doing nothing except sit back and take a cut. Not a 100% sure, but how long exactly are projects allowed to go forward without funding? John whatever difficulties you are having they do not justify your actions or disgruntle words to backers. Projects like these are rollercoasters but do not justify lack of updates, misleading information and continuous spamming with discounts for products that don't exist! Peace out, let the titanic sink! 私達Backerは騙されているのでしょうか？ Jonさん、いつになったらYuFuは発送出来るのでしょうか？(StormTagもまだ完成していないそうですね。)私達は待たされて…待たされて…待たされ続けて…すでに1年以上待たされていますよ。新しいビデオはいつ公開されるのですかね？正直言って、あなたの口約束は全く当てになりませんね。あなたの言い訳も聞き飽きました。「忙しい」と言っておきながら出資者への反論を書き込む時間はあるのはどういう事でしょうか？あなたが本当に忙しいならYuFuの進捗について書くべきことがたくさんあるのではないですか？「書く事が何もない」というのは「何もしていない」のと同じ意味ですよ。私達出資者にはあなたが日々何をしているのか全く見えないんですからね。私達Backerの要求が多過ぎますか？私達の望んでいるのは進捗状況の説明と明確な発送スケジュールだけですよ。これが望み過ぎとは言えないでしょう。リリース・スケジュールもはっきりしないYuFuの様なモノのことを日本語で何と言うか知っていますか？「絵に描いた餅」って言うのですよ、Jon Athertonさん。 Kickstarter, Your failure to protect the backers of this project, is the exact reason why I will NEVER use this service again. Hex3, Your treatment of financial backers is atrocious, and I will never even think of buying a single product you ever make. i still cant believe this project hasn't completed yet - between this and the agent watch - i am done with kickstarters - they should change the name to scammers. i can't believe i jumped into this fab! HEX3 is in trouble I think... Another 40% off email.. Jon's rent must be due... I received it too � Yeah the emails about all the wonderful products and still nothing for the kickstarters? it's insulting really. At this point it would be good money after bad. Are you guys crazy....the opportunity to get another one of these for 60% of cost and you are complaining. Think I might get one for everyone in the family!!! lol. So, has this product always just been vaporware? I don't get it, i'm getting spam email from Yufu to preorder a stylus. Says nex shipment is end of June and Nomad coffee is shipping now?! Why aren't they shipping us the ones we backed first before asking for more money?!?!?!?! Jon, it's now June and we have had no word from you on what's going on. Please give an update. Shameless.... Just bought an Adonit jot script 2, will let you all know my thoughts once I get my hands on it. Given up on this turkey. We are all yufools, we should start legal action. Me nothing(((( Anyone got the Adonit Jot Script 2 yet? Same size point and has pressure sensitivity...not to mention that it actually exists! Happy June 1st...? ;~;" Well, May just ended. No shipping and no update... Can't you communicate??? @ James He had perhaps spending too many hours in dealing with the comment forum here instead of something productive as he said repeatedly. 2nd April. "Finally nailed it down -- shipping in May". That's another fail. What's the latest excuse? Jon, time's up for an update pls I truly believe that even if this works as described, and doesn't have the same problems that artists have been complaining about with other stylus like from Wacom, that due to technological advances and the planned changes that Apple, and others are coming out with, this project will have a short lifespan due to the time to market issue we are all seeing. I hope to be wrong, but this area of technology is moving so fast. I did of course mean "world's finest..." although could of course have replaced that with "longest awaited"... To steal one of your word plays Jon, it's becoming harder and harder to have patience over these patents. When exactly will all of your backers "be proud to own..the world's digital art and writing instrument"? I see your StormTag message board has just as many disgruntled backers... Or they really do work on a stylus... <url>"force touch" feature in iOS9 - then I think you'll be pretty disappointed when that actually comes out. Firstly, it'll only be in the latest generation of devices - so you'll have to make a costly hardware upgrade. Second, it only adds force differentiation. But not anywhere near the sensitivity we need in a stylus. Plus, Apple is still stubbornly stuck on planet finger. Force touch will still require a larger than ideal contact point with the screen. YuFu still appears to be the best bet going. Unless you buy Wacom's tablet offerings. But those are both pretty pricey. Of course Wacom + Apple would a wet dream come true. I doubt Apple will give up giving you the finger any time soon! (All pun intended.) It's all a moot point now... <url>" I've now wasted a couple of hours on this forum rather than doing something productive. " Hours doing what? Writing one update every three months or getting into text bouts with your customers? Yeah it's the upset backers complaining about a year over due project with no photographic evidence that the product even exists posting on the message board that is delaying the project. APR 20 "an updating coming soon....." May 19 "big update coming soon....." May 26 a HUGE update coming soon? ... holding my breathe Everything in life is relative & with only one other Kickstarter under my belt, other backers here would have far more experience of how each creator operates. Maybe it was beginners luck but my previous project was an absolute joy from beginning to end. The complications encountered were shared and some of the technical wizards among the backers actually suggested creative solutions and even tested samples for the creator. Sure, there were disputes within the comments, but it was still a friendly place to visit. ( I recall one lady requesting Jon, some time back, to only provide info within the updates, as she didn't like visiting the comments tab). Even the pros and cons of competitors products were discussed openly with the creator. I guess for me, the enjoyment was feeling part of the team and enjoying the ride. In comparison, this one feels like a journey in the dark. LOL. Not much has changed. Perhaps a few new names representing the vocal disgruntled backers. Jon, I like everyone else would just like an update as to where the project is at, shipping time frames, etc. Thanks Exactly when will we be receiving an update as to shipping schedule. I signed up to fund this in January 2014! During the funding, there was not mention of issues with design and building understand problems arise but you need to keep backers informed. @Barrett I agree the updates are lacking in terms of evidence of progress. But if Jon does make good on a shipping schedule that isn't way off in the future I'll be happy with that. If shipping dates pass, nothing arrives and Jon does not address it then I think it will be fine to go muckraking, but not defaming, like some backers have done. I'm also annoyed the project is so late though. @Samuel It was mainly because he delivered the Jaja and Nota that I signed up for this project? Jon, admits himself, he has experienced setbacks. This is the fun part; facing hurdles and finding creative ways to get over them. Unfortunately this take time and the danger is bringing an out of date technology to the market place. As I have mentioned before, Apple have lodged numerous stylus patents and have the big advantage of being able to change the playing field I.e. the iPad to suit the stylus. A new 12" iPad has been rumoured. If it was that easy, I always say, anybody can do it. There is an awful lot of new technology in the Yufu Pro to be crammed into such a wee space, so it will and has taken time. Communication is the issue for me, both in quality and quantity. Consider the Stats of Jon's 19 updates:- 6 in the 1st month 10 in the next 9 months 3 in the last 8 months As regards the quality, a distant shot of a plastic bag containing a load of bits is the last visual I recall and that was a few months back. @barret I tried a few times sending emails to kickstarter but it was helpless. Jon knew the rules of game definitely. As he PROMISED to give an update which would include delivery schedule by the end of this week, I would rather stop here and wait for that. I have lost my confidence in Kickstarter and I won't back any project in the future anyhow. @Samuel I appreciate your opinion. Jon's done an okay job on the info in his updates. But it's been almost all text. If he wasn't more than a year past the original target ship date, that might be ok. But is the request for some photos or video (especially given where we are in the timeline) really so unreasonable? @Barrett If I were Jon I might have given up after all these defamatory and inane comments a vocal minority have made... I don't think there is good reason to doubt he has a product, since this is the same guy who delivered the JaJa and Nota. He said an update and shipping schedule is coming soon, why not just wait and let time tell? @jason Rightly or wrongly Jason, I have adopted a *Ludo* approach to future Kicksatrters; I'd like to get this one home first. @jason There's a "report this project button" at the bottom of the campaign page. Barrett and Keith, could you inform us how you communicated with Kickstarter in such a way as they replied to you? There are about four other projects on their site which I have chosen not to back because of how this one has gone. I reported the project some time ago, but never heard back from anyone, and would like to know how you managed to get a response back. @Jon Many of us have tried to communicate with you. The results haven't been satisfactory for anyone - yourself included. Perhaps with a clear picture of the issues from more than just a few people, Kickstarter could better assist you to reduce everyone's frustration, alleviate the tensions and move communications onto a more positive less time consuming footing. I think even you'll agree things aren't very good right now. @barrett I think most of us share your frustration. I too remain hopeful and having invented, patented and sold my products in the past, I can sympathise with Jon over any delay, but not so with his communication skills. I have already contacted Kickstarter a few months back, about an unease amongst backers about the lack of updates and information from Jon plus the growing anti-Kickstarter feeling in the comments section. An update did follow, shortly after, coincidental maybe. Not that it has done any good. I personally am disappointed with the attitude of Kickstarter itself, which is partly why I contacted them. Surely, there has to be some kind of policing. I do agree, every concerned person, should contact them Dear fellow backers, It's clear that Jon is frustrated with his backers. So much so that he's blinding himself to the reality that he's pushing us past the breaking point. I've taken the step of reporting Jon and this project to Kickstarter. Jon's replies here do not align with the guidelines on Kickstarter's Trust & Safety page. So I've asked Kickstarter to see if they can reason with Jon. Their reply indicated they have reached out to Jon. With the goal of trying to get communications onto a better track. It would probably be helpful if more people reported their concerns about this project to Kickstarter. At the moment trying to express them to Jon doesn't appear to be working. But Kickstarter seems to understand that there is an issue here they may need to address. But clarity from more people as to what's wrong would likely help them shape their response. Hopefully we can get this project rolling along again. From what I've seen, almost everyone here still wants to see YuFu completed successfully. When is this going to be delivered. This was touted as the biggest single creative tool for digital artists and has been a huge teaser. I understand how patents work and they are crazy detailed and cumbersome. Some of these should have been planned for and expected but this is getting ridiculous and we need some solid answers. I don't call people out on these things because, being a creator/developer myself, I know this is a process. I just want to say I'm disappointed that this project has seemed to flounder and we are entering into the "unobtainium" zone. I just hope you prove me wrong with this project by getting delivered before this is considered "old" technology. Jon, Not to change the subject or anything, but when will we get the Yufu again? (Please don't sue me!) @Jon Can't understand what diverted you so long. Since you've flatly refused to see reason or common sense. And you've pretty much just personalized some canned answers. If you'd read my posts (or any of the others by good folks here) - you might actually be starting to comprehend that there could maybe, just possibly, be something wrong with your "rules" for updates. I'll save you some trouble. Don't bother replying to this one Jon. I'm done trying to get through to you directly. And apparently you don't have anything useful to say in reply. So there's really no point sending another semi-canned utterly unhelpful response and wasting more of your time. Jon," I've personally backed 63 projects and never demanded anything of creators.".....maybe that's because they either delivered, or showed you a video of, the finished product, at some stage? If you don't want people to be a thorn in your side try posting an update, include photos and video. Your attitude is "I'm Jon, I will do it my way and xxxx you" That's not the way to be respectful. Just a quick note, I'll have some exciting updates at the end of next week - so around 27th March. These were your words Jon, you just keep letting us down. @Terence Chan, @James McColl, @JK, @Jason Pearson - Too right all of you! A little perspective: Pebble Time Launched Feb 24, 2015 and on May 21, 2015 released their 19th update. Plenty of info, lots of pictures. Nothing they would rather not show us (or their competitors.) All around pretty good updates. YuFu launched Dec 2, 2013 and released it's 19th update on Apr 2, 2015. I'm not saying that YuFu should be matching Pebble update for update. But I am trying to show that you really and truly are not updating anywhere near often enough! To boot, you continue to persist in ignoring repeated requests (demands, screams, cries, threats, and other forms of trying to get through to you) that you MUST include a lot more pictures and/or video in your updates. Providing some visual confirmation is the only way to restore backer (aka investor) confidence. You would not get away with the terrible status updates you've been providing and ignoring demands for further information if you were dealing with traditional investors. Remember you have 1,939 bosses on this particular job from Kickstarter alone. Obviously I don't have figures for all the additional sales you've made post campaign on the basis of successfully being backed by all 1,939 of us here on this Kickstarter campaign. This ain't no free ride Jon. You gotta pay to play. On this ride that means updates. Quality updates. Regular updates. Any of this getting through? Jon, no need to fight with anyone here posting a few pictures of the final products now will be self-explanatory Haha, who needs Netflix with entertainment like this comments section! Yes, I did use Google Translate, what of it? Not everyone does but there's no reason Serge's comment should pass unavailable to those who don't. You can add up my comments as much as you like, it's of no consequence to me. What I have written here is far milder than the views of others. This would be number 132 for those who feel the need to count. Keith, I think we're all at the back of the queue by now. You keep telling us it's the best pressure sensitive stylus but you can't provide us with anything but words, that's all we have had for 17 months. Show us a short video or even photos. Your last update suggested shipping in May ( with luck!). Be realistic, don't keep stringing us along, be respectful to your backers by just keeping us informed of where the project stands, don't keep telling us how good a mythical device is. Whatever slim chance we have Charmianne, I think you are at the back of the queue! Hehe Charmianne we can all use translate thank you. If you dont have anything to add i'll just leave this here : Jon, I sent you 65$ for what should have been my last year's birthday present. Now that i know you like to enhance the truth and keep trying to rake in more money with people that haven't got their reward, i want to tell everyone not to give money for something they aren't seeing by their own eyes. I want to be respectful and considerate but now that i know where you come from really... 90's internet porn industry. Translation for Serge Van Rijzeghem Dear Jon, It is a little hard to understand why you are so outraged at the comments on this forum. Several people have given you a lot of money together to support your project and especially because they believe in it. The delivery of the product has far exceeded its expiration date. Meanwhile, already more than a year. Many people are displeased about and that is quite understandable. When you start to send people emails with offers for the product that you can not deliver to your investors (that is all backers) to sell. Then you should not be really surprised that people there are angry. In this way, you lose all credibility. I think I speak not only for myself when I say that you've lost all these people's trust. The investors in your project stand nowhere, they can just wait until you come across. If those people speak to you,only respond with tough language. And with no concrete plans. That's a shame, because the Yufu could make it really. But unfortunately it seems that it will end in nothing. I've said here long ago that I resign as many investors simply lost my money (as in the Stormtag). No, this is a great amount per individual, but if you do the math (and you certainly have done) then you come quickly to a very tidy sum. If you are fair or unfair? I do not know. Have the people cheated or have you had simply bad luck with this product? Also, I do not know. What I do know is that everyone orders were expected in April 2014 and the finish line of this whole project has not been reached. If it all gets to the finish anyway. Dear Jon, so it's up to you to show whether you're an honest person or not. Serge :-) Honestly Jon, I just don't get it. You have a clear contempt for the "crowd", or at least their right to voice their displeasure. So why continually pursue crowdfunding to raise finance, especially when it appears as though you already have access to other capital, presumably at a much lower cost base to what KS and Amazon charge you? Regarding your recent comment Jon: 1) That you'll only post an update when you have sufficient information to justify one - the fact that, after all this time, you still don't have sufficient information is more than enough justification to post an update and tell us what really is going on. 4) Re patents - if you don't have clearance on the patent side, why do you continue to market and pro-actively sell this product, until such time as you're comfortable you're in the clear?? 5) The follow-up emails talk of placing your "next order" etc. You refuse to provide clarity on this. What happened to previous orders? And in those emails, you fail to mention the current status of the project. It's deceitful, any which way you look at it. 6) You set the target funding amount, not us. At that time, you also said this thing was basically ready to go. It also now sounds like you have enough access to capital to have created this thing on your own, or at least bring it over the finish line. 7) You sure do have the right to defend yourself, but if you'd spend the time you allocate to doing that, into telling us what the heck is going on, I suspect you'd have less "defamation" to deal with. Please also deal with the defamation "suits" AFTER you have delivered fit-for-purpose product to all backers. My English is not that good so i am writing this down in dutch. if someone wants to translate it. Go ahead... Beste Jon, Het valt een beetje moeilijk te begrijpen waarom je zo verontwaardigd bent om de reacties op dit forum. Verschillende mensen hebben jou samen veel geld gegeven om jouw project te ondersteunen en dat vooral omdat ze er in geloven. De oplevering van het product heeft zijn houdbaarheidsdatum ruim overschreden. Ondertussen al met ruim een jaar. Veel mensen zijn daarover misnoegd en dat is best te begrijpen. Als je mensen mails begint te sturen met aanbiedingen om net het product dat je niet kunt leveren aan je investeerders (want dat zijn al die backers) te verkopen. Dan hoef je je echt niet te verbazen dat mensen daar boos om zijn. Op deze manier verlies je gewoon alle geloofwaardigheid. Ik denk dat ik niet alleen voor mezelf spreek als ik zeg dat je bij al deze mensen krediebiliteit verloren hebt. De investeerders in jouw project staan nergens, ze kunnen enkel wachten tot jij over de brug komt. Als die mensen jou daar op aanspreken reageer jij enkel met stoere taal. En niet met concrete plannen. Dat is heel jammer, want de Yufu zou het echt wel kunnen maken. Maar helaas lijkt het er op dat het op niets zal uitdraaien. Ik heb me er al lang bij neer gelegd dat ik zoals veel investeerders gewoon mijn geld kwijt ben (net zoals bij de Stormtag). Nee een supergroot bedrag is dit per individu niet, maar als je de rekensom maakt (en dat heb jij zeker ook gedaan) dan kom je al snel aan een heel aardig bedrag. Ben jij eerlijk of oneerlijk? Ik weet het niet. Heb je de mensen bedrogen of heb je met dit product gewoon brute pech gehad? Ook dat weet ik niet. Wat ik wel weet is dat iedereen zijn bestelling in april 2014 had verwacht en dat de eindmeet van dit hele project bijlange na helemaal nog niet bereikt is. Als het zowiezo de eindmeet al haalt. Beste Jon, het is dus aan jou om te laten zien of je een eerlijk mens bent of niet. Serge :-) @Jon you said over 15 months ago that you were ready to deliver this product and that you considered the project to be low risk. You said you had working examples and that you only needed capital for manufacturing. Every update you have provided since then has shown that none of that was true. We have rights as well and you regardless of where your organization is located, you have legal obligations to those that backed this project. As I said before, Jon only comes out when he feels slanderous comments have been made or to threaten legal actions against those he considers trolls, but what we would call "previously happy customers" or "potential future customers". @JK it's quite easy to find contact info for the author of the article. Just google- thomas chamberlin courier mail. Going to be pretty disappointed if there's no video or evidence of at least a semi-functioning product in the next update. Noticed the hex3 Facebook page has been taken down, for someone to do that when they're still marketing preorders of their product smells fishy. It wouldn't seem so hopeless if any of the 3 (storm tag/yufu/aclock) already shipped, but all equally delayed somehow. Hopefully more lawsuits for failed projects force Kickstarter to offer recourse when deceptive timelines and promises are given. Every time I look at the project timeline posted in the campaign it makes me laugh at how absurd and misleading it was. Update never came after the April 29 comment that stated soon as well, hopefully soon doesn't mean 2016... Jon, "1,939 backers pledged $141,173". 1 year + late, no updates for ages (the updates that are posted lack answers) and you can't even post a video of a prototype you claim is in productions. I am not (prejudging, I am accusing: scam. <url>"David H @shmoos74" has already received his after he "spammed all [your] friends on twitter warning them not to do business with [you]". So are the Yufu's done or not? Your marketing email today claims you're placing your "next" order with the factory - what happened to stock from the prior orders? Secondly, out of interest - what is your involvement with Nomad Coffee? Again, saw this on your Twitter. Nomad was a KS project by UniTerra in the US, but your version of the website (<url>"He is also not allowed to have any contact with his alleged victims." That explains the lack of updates! :) But seriously, how the fvck did we NOT know all this about him before the campaign? If anyone can find the name or contact details of the Prosecutor, I'd certainly love to send them a letter/email about other things possibly worth a look... The author of the article is THOMAS CHAMBERLIN. Anyone know of a way to get his contact details? Indeed, again trying to seduce people to buy non-existant products like the Yufu and the Stormtag. In Holland we call this "fraud".Am I the only idiot who backed Jon twice? If he is not stupid, he is very desperate to grabbing more $$ for his reasons Haha, very true. It is certainly shameless isn't it? Not so busy that he can't find the time to try and cadge more money from us by offering sale coupons on non existant products. Okay, so I figured out why Jon isn't getting back to us on anything, and he actually might have a legitimate excuse this time! According to this article - <url>"next date before Brisbane Magistrates Court is in May." He is just too busy with his prior legal battles to get back to us! It's too bad we are quick to assume the worst... oh, wait. "Our NEXT order with our factory"......hmmmmm... The ones that were made for us are....where now? Next order offer to backer? A genius way of project update ... LOL I have received the following email: "I'm placing our next order with our factory - get in quickly to save! As a thank you for being a backer of one of our previous projects I thought you might like a discount coupon to use on any of our products below! Please use the 40% Discount Code below - 15 Hours Only" Why are receiving emails soliciting more money from us backers for a project that none of us have seen in reality? I only read down a short way, but has anyone else received the emails asking to buy his YuFu stylus Pro? The following is text from the email I received. ----------------------------- YuFu UltraFine Stylus, StormTag, aClock HEX3 Innovation. Newest Products & 40% Off! Hi Linda, I'm placing our next order with our factory - get in quickly to save! As a thank you for being a backer of one of our previous projects I thought you might like a discount coupon to use on any of our products below! Please use the 40% Discount Code below - 15 Hours Only final40 The YuFu includes accelerometer, compass and gyro sensors to detect which direction the stylus is moving and it passes that data onto the App you are using using low power Bluetooth. Other fine point styluses can't compete with the precision. YuFu Pro also includes tilt, gestures and palm rejection. Thanks! Jon Atherton Founder HEX3 Copyright © 2015 HEX3, All rights reserved. You Purchased or Began a Purchase at HEX3.co Our mailing address is: HEX3 SUITE 808, 1220 N. MARKET STREET Wilmington, DE 19801 <url>"stylus perfected;" although at this point it will be the stylus perfected with 2 year old technology. But at least we would have a stylus. Currently, however, I am not optimistic. I've waited too long....getting my CC company to take over Surely someone in Aus knows the legal process. is there any update - or just another scammer. "YuFu is the world's finest digital art and writing instrument. Reliable and precise, a stylus that you will be proud to own"..........cheers me pls With almost 2000 backers someone has to have some kind of legal background. I am just tired of the lies. I have asked for money back no response. I have asked for updated REALISTIC time line and nothing but lip service. Long overdue in my opinion We are a bunch of suckers ---- time to start some legal action? ... Again? 13 May ........probably delayed by some unexpected technical issue It's already there <url>"Reliable and Precise". Yeah, how would you even know that when you're still working on it? :) Saw this on another failing project. Yufu might be a great candidate! Just email the author- contact provided in the article. <url>"YuFu is the world's finest digital art and writing instrument. Reliable and precise, a stylus that you will be proud to own." " I had hoped to have some video of the electronics in action, but that will have to wait until the next update - the boards weren't ready." So, when was reliability proven. Jon, I appreciate your generous offer but can I get my stylus from your backer project that I have paid for over a year first? Just got an email Subject: 25% Off + Free Shipping - Storewide Message: "Hi Dominic, Click Here to visit the HEX3 Store Please use the Discount Code below - Sale is for 24 Hours Only Code= yufu25" Why would I want to buy another one if I haven't received the first one yet? So this means we were right to consider that when we backed this stupid project, it was in return for the promised stylus (depending on the amount pledged) and not a load of flimflam and insult from the creator. Interesting article, thanks @Ian R Worth 're-reading' this campaign's solicitation with this article in mind. <url>"Be respectful and considerate". I'm left wondering if this comment is actually placed on the "Leave a comment" field or just the painful ones. I'm also wondering whether the project creator sees the same reminder in the area where the write their updates. So... Still ignoring all comments and customer support e-mails, Jon? Great job, really great job... @barret, I could not disagree with you more. The updates have been few and without information if you take into account the initial description of this project stated he was done with design and only needed a manufacturer and our money to complete that phase. Considering we are well over a year late for delivery of a product that was supposed to have gone through the primary stages of design, I think the updates have shown little real information other then Jon has chosen the wrong EC designers, the wrong manufacturers, and his initial design was apparently completely wrong as he is still working on that part. I work in project delivery and large scale sales on a daily basis and I can assure you, Jon's updates have all the signs of someone misdirecting our attention from painful truths. I guess a rechargeable battery should suffice and make investors complacent. @Barrett... compared to World War 1 things are pretty awesome... If indeed Yufu is ready for production it should be easy to provide evidence and calm everyone down. updates have been misleading and limited time promotions sent on a product that doesn't exist are enough evidence for concern. Glad you are optimistic... can you send me the prescription of what you are taking? it is obviously working.. :) ... ive accepted this as being a scam.. not the first nor the last time i guess -can only try to get a laugh out of it now. Cheers and stay optimistic..if you are a friend of Jon say hi from me and wish him luck with the court thing he has on his plate now. I see a lot of frustration in the comments here. But reviewing the updates. I don't see cause for concern. Compared to the horrendous ordeal of iPen2. Yufu is practically a beautiful picnic in the park on a sunny day. The level of technical detail in the updates is very encouraging. While I share the opinion that photos would be nice. All of the steps taken in the process so far align with expectation for a complicated product. Stylus projects have a bad track record. We're talking about an extremely complex device. Hiccups are par for the course. The news article and court case are not good news. But they do not prove anything negative about HEX3. If I don't see working preproduction video before July, I might start getting pretty upset. I also backed the iPen2. Compared to that farce, Yufu is still looking like it could deliver first. Via @Ian R : Saw this on the stormtag page: Make your own judgements. <url>"Subject: Creator with $250k, no updates or refunds. Between this and StormTag, Kickstarter has been dragged through the mud for thousands of users. The creator is 1.5 years late with nothing but burry photos, and the rare update. Thousands of backers and I, entered into an agreement as per your terms of use, we selected a reward, this is a contract between a creator and backer, facilitated by you. Now facilitate that the creator account of where the money was spent and have refunds issued for the money that was not. Or approve a project were thousands can back, paying for legal action against the creator. Money talks, if you took money from backers (even if you spin that it was from the creator) there is a reasonable expectation that you provide service to backers, that of accountability to your own terms of service by creators." :( So, I reached out to the developers of Artflow for Android, to see if the yufu would work with Artflow. Turns out Hex3 never answered them either. Result is no yufu in Artflow.. Quote: Hi, Sorry, Yufu stylus won't work with ArtFlow, I tried to contact Hex3 (company behind Yufu) several times regarding Android compatibility but with no luck. -- Regards, Bart JanuszJanusz Quote end. Hope that the stylus will not turn up as crap I have a very bad experience with Kreyos Jon, I realised there were some missing words in your banner above:- YuFu: The Stylus "to be" perfected. Pressure (from disgruntled backers makes creator very) Sensitive (but apparently everything will be) Fine. Tip (don't launch a Kickstarter project until it's ready to produce). : - ) Looking forward to your next update with news on shipping please. I dumped my Yufu emails into the spambox right from the first one way back. Just got another perky email re-selling all the vaporware Jon has been peddling for years now. Has anyone actually received a device of any sort? I understand we kickstarter backers have limited recourse for failed projects, but I'm pretty sure that emailing people repeatedly to sell items that don't exist for extended periods of time is called fraud. Anyone got an idea how we go about alerting the authorities so this scam can be ended? Or should I just have my spam filter take the yufu emails off to live with the NIgerian princesses? This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. Seriously Jon????? You can't even do something so basic as provide an update when you say you are? Who's fault is it this time? We all know it can't possibly be your fault, and that you are not to blame. Let me guess: - you hired the wrong EC designer and had to fire him - you hired the wrong contractors and had to fire them - you hired the wrong manufacturers and had to fire them - there was some cosmic holiday that delayed a meeting and you had to fire them - you were too busy putting out a new email flier for %80 discount if we buy another %200 more product But we shouldn't comment because we are all trolls. I shall not back any kickstarter project again. Not surprised... Expected........too busy with everything but his projects Jon. You always broken our trust. Shame on you! Please send the refund to me if without a scheduled delivery date. We'll Jon, April fools day, going to fool us today? update is useless without a scheduled delivery date and up to now, Jon has not mentioned that whether the stylus is workable on Ipad air 2 Will there be an update this week? After this Kickstarter experience, ordering from the shelf on Amazon in future will be a trifle boring. I mean - the stuff arriving on the day they say, returning it if not suitable. Where is the fun in that? No, give me Kickstarter every time:- The almost ready product you ordered gets changed without consultations, with even an extra battery included. A lack of updates keep you on the edge of your seat wondering not only when it will come, but will it come at all. Then updates about updates. Is there enough left in the kitty to see it through? Comments concerning the creator's personal life. Some concerned backers threatening legal proceedings. Others seeking refunds. Amazon just can't compete with a series 4 Kickstarter project. And the good news.....it is not over yet. Don't want this saga to end....... "they are late - but they will be delivered" will never been better than a solid delivery day @ jon atherton No body said you were guilty. :) Explained everything Saw this on the stormtag page: Make your own judgements. <url>"the world's finest digital art and writing instrument". Please update! We have been waiting to long for this product! Will I EVER receive my YuFu! This is outrageous! Dear Jon, Thank you very much for the update. Thank you for also blocking me on Twitter after I tweeted about the fact that you seem to be a scam artist. I was trying to stick up for others out there who gave their hard earned money to you. I wrote a similar tweet to Benjamin Chen of the MyIDKey Kickstarter debacle, and you know what, He replied to me. Both on Twitter and then on e-mail. And you know what, now his company was bought, and they are making good on the deal. But to block one of your customers, to not even reply to him...what is that about?. I gave you $99 of my hard earned money. I believed in you. I shared your project with friends. I tried to help promote this. I've commented before saying that all we wanted was an update. When we didn't get one for months, when I saw other people on other projects were frustrated, I took to twitter. And you blocked me. You could send short updates on twitter... or even quick responses. But you didn't even respond. 140 characters. Instead, you blocked me. Whats funny is that blocking me only prevents me from following you or seeing your tweets. I can still use your handle. Have you blocked other supporters? Is this how you treat your and potential customers? Is this how you treat someone who manages a huge global community of designers and engineers who could have potentially helped this product take off? Thanks for the update Jon. Can I please have my $99 back? Please? Thank you. Those of use who just ordered the normal YuFu without any fancy electronics expect our products to be shipped NOW. This delay is ridiculous. Thanks for update, Jon. I would have preferred regular updates than an additional battery, but at least you're providing some compensation for the absurd delay, so you have my thanks for that. Hopefully it doesn't take a mob screaming lawyer to get updates that aren't 1+ month in between from here on out since the project is supposedly near fruition. Ken Kaiser about 16 hours ago <url>#section4 "The creator is solely responsible for fulfilling the promises made in their project. If they’re unable to satisfy the terms of this agreement, they may be subject to legal action by backers" So Jon Atherton has $300,000 tied up in preorders that he has stopped updating. Yufu, StormTag, and aClock. Let's kickstart legal action and stop the string of no accountability. He is in Australia and I've been able to collect some information. Anyone a lawyer? --- I have a family friend who is a lawyer - I will discuss this with him and show him the evidence and all the policies :) Not sure when I can do it though. Not to be ungrateful but I think we deserve a little bit more than a spare battery :/ Thanks for your new offer Jon, but one in the hand is worth two in the bush. Living in Australia, you will appreciate that. Delivery date please. Thanks Jon, any targeted delivery schedule? Thanks for the update. If you come through with your next update as promised you will have regained my faith. <url>#section4 "The creator is solely responsible for fulfilling the promises made in their project.

I hate getting taken! Since my payment went thru Amazon they said they only refund under 6 months. Any idea how else to get my money back?? I will be on the phone to my bank tomorrow and will be getting them to start an investigation. They will be in contact with Jon's bank. At last, some real information on what a creator's obligations are! Thanks Ian. got this link from another kickstarter that is failing: <url>"Not answering my personal email. Not giving an update. But time enough to send emails with a 40% reduction if I buy. Jon first answer (my) emails and update the product status. Second finish the products. Third ship the products. After I recieved the products (4) I might consider telling it to friends and others and give you a thank you Jon. Right now I wait and..." OMG - just been on Jon's other current Kickstarter project, Storm Tag, and guess what?! Exactly the same story! Backers asking for their money back as Jon has failed to deliver that too and gone completely silent. Think we can start writing off our investment unless miracles really do happen... Can only guess this project is as doomed as this board game.... <url>’re unable to satisfy the terms of this agreement, they may be subject to legal action by backers. Well its hardly news that this project seems dead in the water. The lack of updates and sale emails we are getting has lost everyone's faith in ever getting one of the stylus's. Their website blog, which for some reason gets more attention then new to the backers, states that all products are going to be shipped Q1 2015. So a few more weeks before kickstarter has another reason to take action and help us backers. At this point I can't believe anyone would be showing support to Jon or his organization. He got busted doing the same thing only a month or so ago, and was calling his financial backers and supporters Trolls while he was doing it. He even acknowledged that he needed to fix that, but here we are again. What a total shit-show of an experience. Jon's next product could come with a gold-plated Porsche 918 and I still wouldn't buy it. Jon, I think I am one of the minority here which show my understanding and patient on your issues in project. However, this time I really feel insulted. You are giving discount code to sell it in even lower price than what you offered to backers? Have you forgot backers are actually your investors, and are the one that give your project trusts so we give financial support to a product that does not exist? I think these worth your respect on giving more attention and care, instead of start selling your product in big discount before any of the backers received it. You insulted and disrespect all your backers. Why do you offer 40 % off on non existent product. Start producing and send to all backers first. I also received the 40% off email. He is out of money to finish project. Bad investment. I'll be surprised if I ever see the stylus. Well, another email from Hex 3, quick quick quick 15 hours only, 40% off a non existent stylus, really? I am getting a little annoyed that there are no updates, and haven't not seen any progress at all (surely you don't call the 'parts' being shipped from china, progress). Yet John continues to peddle his wears, pretty unethical to be honest. STOP the marketing and start producing!!! we have all fell hook, line and sinker to your scam already and we are well aware of your "great" product that has not eventuated, so why on earth would I still pile more money into buying another. Mate, I sure hope you can sleep at night. As I type this, I see right next to the "Post comment" button, its says, "Be respectful and considerate", wished John would take heed of that. Isn't it time to report this to the authorities in the US. In the UK we have a fraud squad that looks into this kind of thing. Not saying that there has been any fraud but perhaps it needs looking at! I too git the 40% email, totally disgusted. It is not the first time I receive the 40% discount promo sales email Scratching my head again Another promo- "15 hours only"( whats happening after 15 hours?? out of stock? you don't have a stock or a product nor the ability to deliver - ... This is outrageous! Jon, Since it's pretty obvious now that you don't intend to deliver I think you should refund the backers who put their trust in you. You got six times more than what you pledged for.. Kickstarter, please respond to this... its a scam. Seriously Jon, more early discount spam? And now you're offering the stylus cheaper than to your KS backers? Not cool. I note that the hex3 YuFu page has been updated from "shipping in October" to "shipping early 2015". Only 3.75 months to go to put the lie to this. Just had a brief look at the project page again. "we do not think that this project is very high risk." "We have working units and have the experience to deliver." Has anybody else noticed that Jon has locked out the comments board for his aclock project? Citing "spam", by which it seems is meant "backers kicking up because of no communication and no delivery". Just about two months now since the last update from Jon ... Yes...got the email today offering the 40% discount on a new purchase. We should receive ours before more orders are taken. Uhm. What's with the coupon? Really? Joke ? BACK99, SAVE40, GET0, WAIT999 Not too impressed. Still have not received my YuFu but am offered to purchase one at a 40% discount. Just send me what I paid for a long long time ago. He is actually selling it for LESS than what we paid for on Kickstarter. What an insult. Would never back him again for anything. Where do I ask for a refund? This are never gonna happen. I wonder how much the long, dragged out port labor dispute debacle impacted the project. Seems like stuff "left China" in the last update, but we never got the "well, stuff arrived today!" update -- which could very well be due to the fact that not much of anything arrived from abroad in January and February. Huh? Should I pay for one with 40% discount now and ask for the refund for KS one later??? I got the same e-mail. He needs to get off his duff and tell us when we will receive what we pledged for. I got an email for 40% off the Yufu. Maybe if I get the one I pledged for first? Any updates? It's been a long time since you updated your backers. It's coming on a year since the scheduled delivery date. At least you should have some idea of when you might be able to ship. This is just ridiculous. I wish that there was a way for all of us to get our money back. Delays and difficulty with production would be a lot easier to accept if there was timely communication. The silence here makes future communication harder to believe and leads to both a loss of confidence & trust. I have no grudges against John, and I understand that there are delays. But as many others have said, a monthly update is not too much to ask. Even if this project never comes to fruition I would still like to know what is going on. not sure if everyone saw this - <url>#section4 Jon, it's time. Thanks for the comfort word, James.... Wait! What! !!! Dennis, don't worry about it, your never going to see it anyway. I completed backetkit survey yet it keeps telling me there'd question I missed yet I cannot enter and redo the survey? What do I do? Jon, plain and simple: Is this ever going into production, or have we all just wasted our hard earned cash on something we will never see? You have been promising for over a year now and (more or less) everyone has lost patience... As Kickstarter asks us backers, "please be respectful and considerate" and give us more regular updates! Thanks Cliff When will we get the next update? I'm hoping this is still an applicable technology once it is finally released. There are a lot of new pens coming out now that seem to have the same features. Refund please.... More than another month since last update. What are the news ? Thanks Jon Atherton,post an Update ! I am tired of asking for updates very single month and recieving replies with 2-3 month delay from you . For once , be a gentleman and tell us ,honestly whether you can really deliver this product or not and if yes ,when it's delivery time going to be. That's the least you can do for $141,173 you have recieved. Jon Atherton, I want my refund!!!!!! I'm so cheated. I bought a basic stylus to use as I've waited over a year. If there isn't a delivery in the next month, I'm going to buy something more sophisticated. Support for iPad Air 4 (2017) , please. Unless future Ipads will have screens with pressure sensitivity built in. Wooden pencil will be fine :) Still very excited. I do hope it's in time for the holidays!!! a refund would be so great right now.... After some research, no any bluetooth fine tip stylus works properly on Air 2 I agree with Neophoeus. We need YuFu works with Air2 or our patience will be worthless. What month should we expect the stylus to arrive? I want something to replace my lost Adonit Pixelpoint Jot... please do make it works on ipad air 2!! I don't know if I'm the only one who is concerned about this sentence in the last update: 'There are sufficient funds to deliver, but I am managing the budget carefully.' There's better be enough funds, considering the funding you got and the discount you were willing to give in the last promo email. Anyway, I am not expecting this to be shipped anytime soon (anymore). The only way I am massively disappointed about (as an investor) is the fact that I fell you have misled us about the progress which has already been made in the original campaign description. That one really sounded like you were already close to being there and you'd only need the funding to get production started. Over the last 12 months I got the impression you had only started inventing the thing with the money (and you just should have been honest with us about this). Ultimately mo that is why I am never going to back one of your projects ever again. Yufool is the worlds worst digital art and writing instrument. Unreliable and imprecise, a stylus that you will regret spending money on. Happy Belated Anniversary guys! :D!!!!!! Will YuFu work period? That is the more pertinent question as Jon in his last update informed us that he is still addressing electronic issues and working on the project. How is it going, Jon? OOC, will YuFu work on Windows 10? Must be a compatibility problem with my old stylus. RollEyes DoubleMint. If and when Jon completes this project I will probably already be using my Apple iProStylus on my old iPadPro. Still hopeful, although lack of forward progress and momentum is only eclipsed by lack of positive feedback updates. Certainly, a biweekly update is not asking too much on a project funded almost 13 months ago. If and when Jon completes this project I will probably already be using my Apple iProStylus on my old iPadPro. Still hopeful, although lack of forward progress and momentum is only eclipsed by lack of positive feedback updates. Certainly, a biweekly update is not asking too much on a project funded almost 13 months ago. After a long absence of comment or viewing I see nothing has really changed here. Rita remains almost endlessly optimistic in her comments. I'm nothing short of impressed that she's even starting to think about her savings from having bought this product "... think of how many hundreds of dollars or euros we save with Yufu." ... though even dear Rita couldn't help but add "If it works". Perhaps, "If it is delivered in a useful time frame." might be a useful addition, oh wait... I've already said that earlier. Charmianne continues to fly the flag for us frustrated folk, thank you. Though I also sincerely think you would be better off by 'writing this off' and redirecting your energies to something that is more probable of generating a positive outcome. Technology continues to evolve in less secrecy (than this project) for the rest of the technically developed world with announcements and rumours of impending products in this space increasing. At least those who bought it in gold may actually get something with residual value. I note also that the estimated delivery date hasn't changed for some time, which would be a compliment if one had actually existed during that period. YuFu continues to evolve in a way that would have impressed even Darwin. On second thoughts, I had better leave him out of it; consequential necessity and natural selection are quite different. After all, survival of the fittest implies validated existence. And I continue to see the "Be respectful and considerate." comment below this box and am left wondering whether the same phrase is displayed for project creators :) Trust everyone is otherwise well and I sincerely wish all the best for 2015. See you in a few months at which time I'm likely be able to copy and paste much of this unchanged and achieve similar meaning; status quo being what it is. *patently obvious*. Seriously now, Apple is considering putting a presentation indicator light in theirs, patent lodged. I can foresee in the future one universal *stick* being used for writing, sketching, presentation pointer, drumstick, bow and many different types of bats and racquets in an assortment of game apps. This is only the start. Just glad, I don't work in the Patent Office. There are now other stylus-developers also using bluetooth for palm-rejection. It's very possible that the huge delay of this product involves a patent dispute. @James McCoil Even Apple are preparing to produce stylus. It seems this investment is a failure. The most important is Yufu big delays into the market. <url>" and 28". I just can't wait to get that Yufu stylus and and test it on monitors in PC store. If it works, think of how many hundreds of dollars or euros we save with Yufu. Charmaine instead of posting every other day about how upset you are about losing 65$, take the loss and maybe, a year from now you'll receive a box, and you'll wonder where this retro stylus came from.. I feel bad for the guy who bought the 18k one.. Got the same promotion. Really? "I know I haven't delivered but would you like to order another one? 40% off. " @Jason, Yup! See screenshot from mail promo i got today: Did i miss something? <url>"quart into a pint pot " is pretty much the archetypal definition of something impossible, so, yep, he's right. If the disc stylus tip is the Jaja one, and the basic Yufu has taken this long to produce something with mainly pre existing parts, that is, tips, then it seems Jon needs a better factory than the one he has. Perhaps if he'd gone for a US manufacturer??? wow. 17 months to wait to get a non digital stylus with no moving parts. there's like a hundred different versions of this available on Amazon. The yufu would have to piss gold in 3D while answering my email to make it worth waiting this long. last time I back one of your projects Jon. How can I get a refund??? I'm really sick and tired of hearing all these updates and updates but will never get done. I don't even want it anymore. I just want my money back. Wow...received an email from HEX3 and it would allow me to order a yufu pro for $59.99....less than I paid. Anyone else see that? Sorry...typo. Container should be Computer, although the size of it was much bigger! I for one, Jon, don't under estimate what you are trying to do. a quart into a pint pot comes to mind. The constant march of technological advances continues to amaze me. Take a SD camera card; 128mb onto a thing as small as a postage stamp for example. When I was just 18, they had to take the roof off my large office and use a roadside crane to lower a container into it. The memory of which was lower than this sd card. That was fifty years ago, which puts into perspective the relatively short wait for your stylus. I think most of us blew a sigh of relief when you finally updated the news, the project was still live. Good luck with the last few gremlins. Hi Jon, any estimation for the delivery date of Pro Yufu? As an investor, surely regular communication is not an unreasonable expectation? I don't have a problem with project delays, but I am unable to appreciate disrespect from creators in whatever form it takes. On a somewhat different matter, Jon I have also backed for four of the aclock products and am wondering how the schedule for them is progressing as the last information on the web site was a couple of months ago (referring us to your blog and locking the comments column) and August 12th in your blog. I'm curious to know why the 'basic' Yufu took this long at all. It appears to be no different to equipment already available elsewhere. The disc tip is the same as the Adonit Jot Pro, the brush tip appears in the picture to be inferior to the DaVinci brush stylus and the regular broad tip no different to the many available cheaply almost everywhere. 118? Jon, am I right interpreting your comments to mean only the Basic Yufu model will be put into full production initially and the electronics involved in the Focus & Pro models need to be sorted before they can be produced? It is worth the wait to get it right. I need it to be so and to be sure, all your business customers will demand it. Your comments and update are well overdue, but much appreciated . Thanks. Thank you for the update Jon. Please keep the updates regular, even if they are "no news yet". Hi Jon Thanks for the update. I note that you have some very strong critics, Charmianne being the most prolific with her words. Other seem to want refunds. Unless I have misunderstood the kickstarter idea it is to link investors with creators. The investors hope is a finished product. This has been my approach and recognise that there is a risk. The risk for the creator if they fail is that their reputation will be shot.. I would note that some have tried to offer you some advice which you have apparently rejected. I would dare to offer the same again. Updates via email at at least monthly intervals would stop most of the comments I have read dating back over the last month. I certainly wish you well and am happy with the two previous projects I helped you fund. I have also pre purchased a couple of StormTags via Hes3 and look forward to receiving them in due course. Unlike some, I will consider any other projects you try in the future, but please more communication Some of you who have commented about refunds need to rethink the legal action idea. Read the kickstarter conditions again. Investors and creators together take the risks. You are not a customer you are an investor. I'm happy to be one in the hope of a return not the certainty. Get real all of you. @Christian, I just read something at this link below. Scroll half way down the page to find out whether Yufu stylus will work on Android tablets or not. I think yes. <url>"He's Alive" Oh, and Jon, I wasn't referring to myself about the trawling through the comments, but just 'bumping' the request made by another backer who was tired of seeing no updates. We are apparently permitted to "talk to your fellow backers" and I don't see a limit counter anywhere. Considering the content of some other backers posts, I'm quite surprised that you feel the need to point out how many I made. Did you add on this one as well? ;-) Could I please get a refund? I no longer have an iPad. Jon, thanks for putting an update in the updates page. You hadn't actually done that already, as you said, because I had just posted my request after visiting the updates page, but no matter, Perhaps our postings crossed paths at the same time. As it happens no news is, well, no news, but we deserve to know even that. I see you're keeping tally of my posts...that would be important to someone I guess. As for being virtuous, if no one spoke up at all, would we be any the wiser as to your continued efforts or even your existence! This was my first-time Kickstarter experience and i must say I am disappointed. Original delivery was scheduled for April 2014. It is now January 2015. I sure hope they offer an upgrade for all the waiting they have made us do. If they weren't ready to do this they shouldn't have asked for the money. Hi Jon, Happy New Year and thanks for the much appreciated update. Inventing is a slow art-form - and I , for one, welcome the care your are taking to make sure we get the best possible product. Patience is a virtue - so I shall remain virtuous! To all those who are being abusive & negative - it doesn't help... Thanks Jon for news. You mention only the basic YuFu will soon be in production. What news on the Pro version? Cheers. Will your backers get to see a prototype in action, hmm? So why not stick that in the Updates page for those who aren't interested in trawling through the comments to find information, Jon? Looking up the whois on <url>#q=jon%40clean.net.au Does anyone else have the gut feeling, the next and last update will be on April 1st? lol. I can't remember.. Is this going to work on android tablets? I'm worried that my iPad retina 1. Gen no longer will work with this pen with it is delivered. An earlier comment pointed out that backers should be less focused on product and more on backing a great idea to see it come to fruition, but without product, there is no 'fruition' just a great idea on paper and in the mind of someone who has our money now. We've done our part, we've handed over cash to a 'man with a plan'. Looks like we're just realising what that 'plan' was. I don't feel the least bit guilty about being dissatisfied with Jon's offhand attitude towards us (and the Stormtag people) His bit of whining and mumbling in this comment area on the 19th of December last doesn't count as an update. His silence suggests he's no longer on top of this project if indeed there was ever a project at all beyond the initial mockup and video. And what about that video, was there ever an actual working prototype or was that all fantasyland too? Well, this sucks. Happy New Year Rita, You make some positive points. I really admire your optimism. In fact you make me feel almost guilty to be doubting the poor fellah. Hehe. Cheers. Happy New Year, everyone. I can see many people here losing patience. The waiting is understandably frustrating for some. I am still hanging on, no matter how long it may take. I have faith in Jon's project. I have recently learned that batches of iPen 2 here in Kickstarter have been released, 2 years after crowdfunding. I had preordered mine over a year ago. I had backed TruGlide Apex stylus and received mine a year later. If Jon is delaying to deliver update, it must mean he is extra busy with working on Yufu stylus. We must be near the end, folks. It looks it to me. I had experienced delays with TruGlide Apex last year and also with Ipen 2 for much longer time. Longest delayed updates most occur near the time of production and shipment. If Jon is delaying this long, it must be good news. We might be near the end. I hope I am not over-optimistic. To obtain a broad balanced view ot the situation I am also monitoring the StormTag comments re.product delay and lack of updates. Although official updates have dried up, a guy, over there, did have a reply message from Jon on 2 Dec and with our Yufu we had a comment as recent as the 19 Dec to say that money is there to bring the product home. The combined investment of the two products is around US$250,000, so I don't think cash flow is the problem here. Although the decision by Jon to curtail updates is unacceptable to most of us, there must be a personal reason for it. A balanced view means considering both sides and for the life of me I can't imagine both products being delayed by technical problems. Further, if you wish to establish a long term business then customer involvement and satisfaction is prime. I would suggest that Kickstarter use the YuFu project on their homepage as a Masterclass,- on how NOT to proceed ! Happy New Year, Everyone! I was fine with waiting but lack of communication brought me to such a point. So, I will just leave it here: <url>"Worst Kickstarter" project. I urge all backers to email tech sites (Techcrunch, Gizmodo, The Verge) regarding this project. Get some attention on this project, and lets light some fire under Jon. Let him know that as Backers we deserve to receive communication. And Jon: "To answer some questions from earlier - yes the fine point electronics work on iPad Air 2. I have been waiting on a revised board before doing an update - clearly we have had some technical difficulties and marketing/packaging material is ahead of production. When you see the electronics and how small everything is you might understand the delays. I can assure everyone that we're still working hard on this product, I have spent a lot of money building it, but still have sufficient to deliver it to everyone. Yes it's late, but it will be delivered." That could have been a update post. I'm not upset about not receiving my reward. I funded a product I believed in, and I still think it will be worthwhile. However, I'm disappointed that Jon hasn't communicated openly, and with any regularity. His current attitude goes against the very open nature of Kickstarter. I could point you links to half a dozen other Kickstarter projects that have been delayed, and all of them provide frequent updates, and communication. I'm very disappointed in Jon as I've funded all his projects, and I have always spoken highly of him, and his company. Months with no news? Months? I expected more from you Jon. Seems like this project has been all about the 'kick' and not about the 'start'. Mr. Erik Herz has backed 24 Kickstarter projects, these last 4 years. Guess folks, how many Kickstarter comments he has needed to make? One. Just this one. That fact alone, surely must raise some Kickstarter eyebrows. Hopefully, it might KickStart Mr. Atherton into update action. I'm no stranger to Kickstarter, nor am I a stranger to Kickstarter tech. I fully expect projects to be pushed back weeks or even months. In fact I don't beleive that a single tech project I have backed has shipped within the original time estimates given during the funding drive. What's a problem here is that we are getting zero updates from Mr Atherton. It certainly gies the impression that either Mr. Atherton does not care about his backers or that something has gone wrong and this project is dead. It's very understandable that people (myself included) are very frustrated with some seeking refunds. Mr. Atherton should get us an update considering the time passed since the last time he communicated to his backers 1 year after the closing of the KS, i allreasy worn out multiple Ipads, and went back to state of the art pencil & paper, no need for waiting for the stylus. i Wonder if i can get a refund for the HEX3 stylus. Oh dear, 75% of a non existent stylus is still a bad deal. The official website is still offering an pre-order of Yufu stylus at 25% off and says it will be delivering soon...... I would like a video of the stylus in action for our first 2015 update please~ Almost a full year since Jon got our money...I wish he'd stop whining about us being unreasonable and actually show us what he's done with over $140,000. There are more than 10 backers waiting. I've also contacted Kickstarter and they are as silent as Jon. Losing faith in this whole process...which is a detriment to the honest, hardworking people out there using Kickstarter legitimately. Communication goes a long way to keep faith alive. Please refund +1. No delivery schedule and no update. I guess there are only 10 backers patiently wait. But that does not include me. I have also asked to receive a refund. i emailed @creator and figured i'd post here - please refund my money So, I'm still hopeful that I will eventually get my stylus. Anyhow, I have asked on here as well as emailed your company asking how to change my shipping address but have gotten no response back. If you do in fact maintain your radio silence until the product has shipped, then I will not receive my product. Please get back to me. Thank you. I'm not surprised that Kickstarter doesn't care, the creator certainly seems to have lost interest except in asking for further funding for his other schemes. Hello Jon, how are you? you're having some good holidays? Here you are well despite the temperatures have fallen overnight. I remember one about a year ago I had trusted to finance some project in Kickstarter, projects that interested me. I must admit that being my first approach was convinced that same throwing money to the wind that I could invest in more of my interest, or more helpful. The first project to which I gave a contribution was yours, as well presented, the final product turned out to be something serious and professional. The other two projects to which I contributed were Snooperscope and Haloband. They too have had problems later during the various steps of the production, after their project was funded. But they, not we have "sold" words, excuses, advertising related to other projects on kickstarter. Their product I could touch, despite some hitches. I expressed my opinion about you to focus and concentrate their energies on a single project, "WHO WANTS EVERYTHING, NOTHING TIGHTENING" but in this case we are to feel cheated. This is the typical behavior of those who behave as gay, with the other's ass. Thing that I absolutely can not stand. You also stopped deluding ourselves with your updates, so you head elsewhere, logically. I do not pretend with my words compensation, but at least I'd like to be more vigilant about Kickstarter projects sponsored and not completed. Since, because of you Jon, you have helped me not to trust most of the next and his purposes. I wish you all good Jon, and I hope that in the future, you have a lot more respect for those who have placed their trust on you. Copy this text you read I also sent to the proper authorities of Kickstarter. FYI, I contacted Kickstarter a few days ago about this project and they just don't care. We are all alone on that. I think i'll start looking for legal advices in Australia on our situation. I have a few friends there who might help. To use @creator's words from his last comments: "We have your address, we'll be in touch directly" or rather our lawyer will. This user's account has been deleted. Should be more like "surprised to get one ". The comment about Kickstarter being a "deregulated money making scheme " seems to have hit the nail on the head. I'm over this now. I've learned a costly lesson here. How could Jon say that the "Yufu is the world's finest..." when it hasn't even been produced?! "Reliable and precise", now there's a joke. So when exactly will we be "proud to own" one?! The lack of an update is scandalous. Looks like we have all been ripped off! I'm starting the New Year with a resolution never to back a Kickstarter project again. That seems like a very positive way to begin a New Year. Can KickStarter please step in and help all the backers with betrayed expectations get their money back? This platform shouldn't be(come) some sort of gambling platform nor a completely de-regulated money-making scheme in the hands of the unreliable or the downright irresponsible. I think at this point backers should be giving an update with realistic updated timelines. I feel if nothing is produced so I will start looking into getting a refund from my credit card. I have been patient but this is getting ridiculous. On Jan 2 it will be one full year since this project was fully backed...and still no concrete answers to the question of when we may expect delivery. Jon please give us an update as to what is happening and when we may be able to expect delivery of what we backed. I see on th Hex 3 website the product is and has been listed for preorder...when can we expect it? Thank you While Jon has posted a few times here in comments, the last update was over 3 months ago.. Clearly he has no intent or interest in keeping us current backers as future clients as I don't know anyone that would buy from a company that treats it's customers as poorly as he has..I have backed a few dozen projects here on Kickstarter and never has there been such poor communication and lack of caring and commitment as shown here.. If there are valid reasons for delays, then they should be communicated consistently. I backed a few that took about a year when they over promised that the product would be delivered in 6 months.. It was tough, but they at least constantly gave us updates, even if it was just to post they understood our frustration and let us know they cared and were going to give us the best possible product. This isn't about you Jon, it's about us - we are the ones that funded this for you.. I'm a true believer that what goes around comes around... You've failed us and yourself as a business owner because you (or any business for that matter) has to have satisfied customers to continue and grow.. How about you end this year and start the new one off right, and post a detailed update about what's gone wrong, right and when this is going to be delivered, and then keep updating every 2-3 weeks until you deliver on your promises. Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year. A comment once a month is enough to keep this alive for me. Anything you want to crowd source that we can help with Jon? Merry Christmas to Jon and backers. � That's the question most of us here are asking. Merry Christmas in spite of that though! :-) just curious, are we going to get the stylus or not????? been waiting for this stylus for a long time.... maybe we all should looked at the campaign title more carefully. YuFu: The Stylus Perfected. as one can imagine there is no such thing as Perfected. One can try to get as close to it as possible but no dice. Maybe that's why this one hasn't shipped and probably never will coz Perfection takes time and that means months, years, decades.... :p *chuckle* Can I start a refund service for people that don't want to wait any longer by buying back YuFu's from other backers? Maybe create a re-backer project? I'm still plenty excited and wouldn't mind buying a couple more if only to give as gifts. Jon promised to deliver with an investment of only $25,000. He raised $141,173. It's not a bad salary for a year of work, is it? I'm not sure if anybody was complaining as he added features, but now that the features are expected, and delayed, it's a problem? Not for me. I didn't complain about going from AAAA battery to rechargeable, for example. Take your time Jon, but it would be nice to send an update on a regular basis regardless of the project status. The detailed updates with photos are great, but if time doesn't allow, certainly you can post a one liner to let everybody know you are alive and well or that you are taking a break. Makes it easier for everybody to keep it positive here also and will work wonders when the product hits the market and there are nothing but good words about you and the project management regardless of the quality of the stylus. Also, these devices are like phones, nobody expects them to last very long - one or two years and the technology changes. I'm looking forward to supporting version 2. Don't sweat it too much, guys. Try to complain to Kickstarter instead with some useful ideas. Maybe they (or Jon for his next project) can add an option to buy back if the date isn't achieved and allow others to pickup the slack for those that don't have the patience for this sort of thing or that genuinely find something better where the contracted delivery date has been exceeded. Let's keep it positive as this space if for backers (like it says: cheer on the creator, be respectful and considerate, etc.). For example, has anybody seen something better on the market than this? I have many styluses that turn out to be useful for only certain things. If this one can work better than than the Adonit (touch and script), I will be happy. If the battery doesn't last as long as the Lynktec apex and Pencil 53, I may be sad. I would love to see somebody take the Pencil 53 and create a new fine tip for it (the cartridge includes the tip which you remove for charging). Happy New Year to everybody. Go enjoy the holidays and let's wait for next year to hear what's up with this project. Agree. My Xmas wish is Jon can deliver his described product soon No guarantee that this will be as brilliant as he describes. The Nota isn't any good, yet look at the glowing description it gets on the website. A delayed product is no guarantee of a good product, it just means it's delayed and that can be for worthwhile reasons or sheer incompetence. We're obliged to wait, but that doesn't mean we have to do so without voicing our views. Be fair I had experience with a smartwatch project which updated very frequently but delivered crap at last. So, Jon, don't fail our expectation for a brilliant product. Wish he would post updates. A word or two goes a long way. We all want the rewards, but we also are passionate about the idea, and want to be involved. Discuss the troubles, and hardships you are having. Kickstarter is suppose to be about backers being involved in the work of the creator. It's not a business arrangement where we are investors, and you only show us the good stuff. Updates please. maybe the creator is waiting for the yet to be invented technology before completing this one.... :x Starting to think YuFu is short for "You Fool" for backing this! Would be nice if a year on we had some idea as to what is happening... I suppose we can be thankful he didn't say that the dog ate his homework, or perhaps that good old ebay standby, the sick parent! I divert all Kickstarter stuff to Junk mail now, regardless. Jon should ask Kickstarter to quit sending out "Kickstarter Projects we love" emails. Just reminds me of this project... then I check in for an update... then no update. I am going to speak to bank so they can investigate this further and refund me. I get we are backing project and not shopping for a made product, but a year later with some really pathetic comments an black of updates and no real proof things are improving or moving along. Will put my refund dome towards something better, Hey, don't missunderstand me, I am also a bit angry, frustrated and who knows what else. But as far as I see this, the only thing what is left, is the hope. I also needed this stylus earlier this year. I never thought it would take that long. Ok, some weeks late is often not unusual for projects from kickstarter. But one YEAR?! So, i keep my energy for things they are worth for and the only thing that is left for me for this stylus is to hope that it will come. SOON. Yes, we've all read that. And yet we aren't impressed. :-) Creator Jon Atherton on December 2 To answer some questions from earlier - yes the fine point electronics work on iPad Air 2. I have been waiting on a revised board before doing an update - clearly we have had some technical difficulties and marketing/packaging material is ahead of production. When you see the electronics and how small everything is you might understand the delays. I can assure everyone that we're still working hard on this product, I have spent a lot of money building it, but still have sufficient to deliver it to everyone. Yes it's late, but it will be delivered. It is the last news I find on the response of Jon on comments of one of us on 2 Dec Creator Jon Atherton on December 2 To answer some questions from earlier - yes the fine point electronics work on iPad Air 2.

I have been patient but what really worries me is the absence of an update for 3 months +1 Jon, Could I please a refund, I no longer have a need for this stylus. I bet anyone hoping to get this to give as a Christmas gift needs cheering up by now. Jon is there a way to get refund. I dont want it man after 8 months a stylus. Will there be an update to at least remind us that you haven't forgotten about us? Use this space to cheer the creator along, ask questions and talk to your fellow backers. Please remember to be respectful and considerate. Thanks! Do you need cheering up Jon. We sure do. Oh yeah, it's great to know how well the packaging is coming along, because of course, we all need a really great empty box. :-D I find it pretty telling that Jon is far too busy to provide even the most basic of updates other then they are having problems but luckily for us the packaging is coming along swell, but he seems to have time to get in touch with Kickstarter management and get comments he doesn't like removed. There is no way that I will be spending another cent on Hex3 products ever again. Kevin has pretty well summed it up for a lot of us I think. We've been taken advantage of and when we complain, Jon gets angry because we no longer think he's a genius designer. I honestly doubt any of us will ever receive an actual product in our hands. I'm just glad I wasn't scammed for more than the $80 I put up, though that's not chicken feed to me either. Wow. Just wow. I've been keeping my mouth shut because I had faith that we'd get an amazing product in a reasonable amount of time, but we're getting close to a year after funding, and... 7 or 8 months after the original release? I was willing to be patient and be happy that we got the rechargable battery since there was some delay, but it's been nearly the same amount of time since that concession was made. It's funny, really. I'm not known for my patience, but I was patient for quite a while with the YuFu because I was confident that it'd be an awesome product, and I'd be drawing with it in a reasonable amount of time. But now my iPad no longer sits as an art device. My Jaja stylus wigged out on me in February or early March, so I stopped using that... and now I'm coding, with very little interest in drawing on my iPad. I really really wanted this to come out great, but to be honest I had almost forgotten about the stylus entirely recently, and now I simply don't care. So I've unsubscribed from updates here -- I guess if I ever see the YuFu at my doorstep I'll be pleasantly surprised. If not, I've already convinced myself that I threw money down the drain anyway, so no big loss I guess. Good day, and good luck to those with more patience than I. @Krämer Frank Aren't you a bit bothered that we still haven't see anything real or concrete about this project? All we've got are words from @creator and a few pictures of what can be empty shells. We are almost one year after this project funded, and @creator haven't upload any video of a stylus in action yet and he went radio silent for a few long months until someone successfully woke him up with a now-removed post about his past life. I saw at the time what this post was about and it looks like we just all got scammed... I backed 2 of the projects of Mr. Atherton. The Yufu, estimated delivery: May 2014. And Stormtag, estimated delivery: Nov 2014. I agree, it’s the second week of December. But looking at the way that Yufu is going, I wouldn’t be surprised if both projects fail to deliver. A total of about $ 250.000 that backers donated. A nice profit, it seems. Well done, Mr. Atherton. It seems that we shall not get the stylus in Yr 2014 but is there any chance for Jan 2015? I doubt it too.... Hey Jon, hey Backers. I am also waiting for this product and can't wait to hold it in my hands. But I also understand that good things take a lot of time to get good. So just let us hope, that Jon makes a good job an we will have a great Stylus for a long time. I can understand a lot of you. I also would be lucky to have more updates to the status of the Stylus. But what if there is no real update? Would you like to hear that? I think we know everything what we have to know. Don't understand me wrong. I also want that stylus as soon as possible. But I can't speed the production up with my comments here. So I will now keep calm again and wait for news - or the STYLUS :) For those who are angry - go out, do some sport, or play a video game. ;) This will be the very best stylus nobody ever had. It's nice that you are adding all this "extra" stuff at no extra charge, but is that really necessary add in us, NOT having the product in our hands? I'm sure it's taking extra time to add all these extras. Please update sooner than sporadically. Jon, we understand you want to create the best stylus possible, but in all honesty that equates to a stylus in the hand that we can use. Why not up your level of professionalism and give everyone an answer and at least confirm whether you're on track and late, or as many here now suspect not able to deliver. That's unacceptable. I want my money back. after this and my dreadful experience with soundband, i am never backing anything remotely technological from kickstarter. YuFu Shipping - Short Delay After several delays caused by electronics and firmware design issues we are now heading for delivery in October. Our sincere apologies for the delay, we can assure you that the final product will be worth the wait! We have added a few features including interchangeable rechargeable battery - which you will get for no extra cost as a thank you for your patience. This added feature has not added to the delivery schedule. Was that October 2015 Jon! @Rich: *IF* delivery happens. We have yet to see any prototype in action. +1 on every single comment re: updates and release dates. As a businessperson, I can sympathize with the challenges of delivery, but as a customer, I'd have to say the brand promise has pretty much been shattered. I share Charmianne's concern that delivery this late will make this tool irrelevant. Jon - Please give us an update as it as been almost a year since the project has been funded. Thank you - - John Update is long overdue! Hi Jon I realise you have had some major problems with the Yufu but please let me/us know what on earth is going on and when we will receive our long awaited stylus. Why for goodness sake did you dangle the carrot a few months back to backers to buy more when it clearly wasn't ready for shipping?! Your last update was back in Sept! I have to tell you that I bought an iPad Air in January for the sole purpose of using your product and still no news almost a year later! Your backers deserve to be kept informed. Cliff Hi Jon, Just to let you know Apple have just recently filed patents for their own pressure sensitive stylus. Maybe to link up with their rumoured 12"pad as well as their smaller devices. Apple Art?Cheers, Keith I still want to receive the product since I paid good money to back this, precisely BECAUSE I was told I'd receive a unit in return for my $80. This was not a philanthropic gesture on my part. I don't wish to jump through all the hoops for a refund, not because I have any faith in Jon, but because I can do without further aggravation. For the most part I've gone back to physical drawing media now with occasional use of my Bamboo Fineline. I haven posted for many months. I just realized that the item promised to me is still no where to be seen. I still want my money back! I want a refund! 欲 速 则 不 达 yù sù zé bù dá Take Your Time Jon! Yo Jon, Savage is about to update their Procreate application and include integrated palm rejection. But the current stylus's on the markets won't work well with it or something. I recommend contacting them and having Savage fill you in on whats changing. So that when the YuFu Pro gets released it can support their new palm rejection. I know you've talked a lot about how much work it has taken to get the YuFu's features working. Might want to sort that out before the release. Cheers Can't wait to use this with my ipad 6 lol. That's precisely why so many are angry. The lack of updates. Mr. Atherton - I would be grateful if you could post your answers to questions as an update. I dislike coming to this comment board seeking information. It is an angry place. Thank you. How can we update our address? I know this question was asked but I haven't been checking the comments enough to know if it has been answered. Thanks! I can´t wait for it. Make the product as good as possible and i will turn a blind eye to the late deliver. Greetings from Germany Soooo.....was that the 'update'? Meant Jon Thank you for the update john This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. Keith is right. In this business timing is everything. It may not be long before the Yufu is irrelevant if it keeps dragging like this. Okay clearly not the only one. Have been waiting for a year and no news. Will I get my pen in 2015? I am not going to buy something else...that said having read the forum I am concerned that the pen will work with and iPad 3. Please update by February. Hehe...indeed. The silence is deafening... "Early Bird Special" oh dear..... I'm happy enough with my iPad mini so I don't worry about compatibility with newer ones. I recently bought a Wacom Bamboo Stylus Fineline which I hope will suit me for the time being. I have Macular Degeneration and really don't have the extended timeline Jon expects us all to put up with. I want something I can play about with right now while I can still see what I'm doing. Wacom have always provided high quality products in the past and No reason why they would be any different now. I haven't received my EARLY BIRD SPECIAL - YuFu? How do I check my status for expected delivery date? Thanks Randolph, I'll give that a go too. @Jessie, you might need to be asking whether it will work with iPad Air 3... or if it will ever work. A reminder again to those who think the "nay sayers" should be quiet... part of Jon's pitch was the readiness, experience and reliability of his estimates.... with more realistic and honest estimates he may well have got closer to the $25k reserve he'd set. Anyway... all history now. Based on feedback from Jon's other sites as well, this is his MO. I'll return to supporting Kiva and projects which my reliable contacts personally recommend, but no longer even browse Kickstarter projects consequent to this and another way overdue rip off project that I had the misfortune of being conned into supporting. (Conned due to similar gross misrepresentation). oh, ya, thanks Randolph for point that out. bought wacom stylus 2 during black friday. so....contiune with steve question, I am not even hurry on this now :D hope yufu would be compatible with ipad Air 2. I wonder about the iPad Air 2 compatibility now. The Wacom Creative Intuos 2 is not compatible with it. I guess the yufu won't be neither. Any input on that Jon?... Please please please may we have an update?! Further, *Selling* is, as we all know, is about selling the right thing, in the right place and at the right time. Technology innovation these days is delightfully rapid. You might have an amazing product in the pipeline with never before seen features at an outstanding price with proven market place sales, but not quite ready. These days the timing of its release into the marketplace is paramount. No time to blink! Hard to call, whether to release as is, or include market leading refinements. That is what management is all about. Meanwhile, we patiently wait for news... Hi Jon, I sympathise with you as I have invented, patented, marketeted and sold my own products with secrecy from the opposition being an ever present concern. That said, part of the reason why I and possibly many others, have supported this project, and you, by association, is to be involved in the process of bringing it to the market place. Tis in this aspect you have failed us. Other products are about to overtake your vision. Sadly, you never shared us completely in it. I wish you well. Oops sorry I mean "unexpected" problems :P Was wishing for a fine tip stylus with pressure sensitivity. I am not blaming Jon, I know there are always expected problem coming out in projects. Thanks for Rondolf pointing out, and I have just bought Wacom Creative Intuos 2. Just got it today, played for a while, happy on it. I believe I will keep Yufu as a backup only, as the Wacom stylus feel so comfortable when holding, for which obviously Yufu cannot compare. The extra features of grip pressure, tilt detection? I believe they are cool but I just don't need that. Wish Yufu come out soon, but I am sorry to say you have lost the golden "Wow" timing. I can see Jon's enthusiasm but obvious you can do better in project management. Dear Jon, It would be nice to do an update, I am happy to know, you are still working (and struggling)with the product and the final production. It is part of the task we have given to you, and backed you plans. One of the recommendations is keep the backing group happy and inform them on the progress, even if there is noting to tell. I am still happy and getting absolutely anxious to get the final product on my desk. Thanks Peter Could we have any updates on this? this been delaied 7 month already. I am not even sure if we could get this before 2015. ( I guess not :( ) I backed this due to the new ipad air....now ipad air 2 came out. and this project still delaying. Do you at least have a working prototype yet. Stop adding features and the constant delays of this project. I am very disappointed To be better right now, it only needs to exist. Jon, everyone is tired of you. You know you failed and you don't care. I'm so stupid I backed you up. All you think is how to improve it. You can't even produce a simple working prototype. Stop day dreaming wake up and start producing. Hey guys (all backers) for your information there is one better than this, it's Wacom Creative Intuos Stylus 2. Jon, your assertion that you've only been intentionally rude to one backer is not supported by the evidence on this very forum. Furthermore your claims of "never ending string of negativity" and "dissent" are unjustifiable and insupportable. Interesting to see the tactics you are prepared to resort to, in an attempt to rationalise and justify your poor attitude. What's really amazing is how you entirely fail to realise how effectively you're alienating the people who backed you. Or maybe you do realise and you just don't care, after all you have our money so there's no requirement for you to retain our goodwill. Two months without an update and no concrete indication yet of progress - your ongoing radio silence is unacceptable, whatever competing pressures you may have. If those competing pressures stem from your other struggling projects, you have only yourself to blame for choosing to launch those while you were already failing to deliver on this one. I'm guessing Jon messed up. Seeing the promotions of other projects he is running, (like that silly bluetooth clock) I can't help thinking that he exploited the kickstarter platform and the backers good will. Backing anything is a risk so i'm not complaining about a failed project or the lost money. Just doubting the integrity and intentions behind this one. I'm guessing Jon could have easily sent more frequent updates to quiet things down. I must admit that updates that were actually sent were over blown with details which amplified the feeling that Jon is trying to shift attention from what the community wanted to hear. (A simple and straightforward delivery date estimate) He must be in such a mess (maybe with vendors and manufacturers- or who knows what) that dealing with the backers community is not on his radar. Kickstarter should be very concerned with this.. I imagine everyone here has lost a some faith in this backing method. :( I for one am not going to back any project for such a sum of money again. He said we'll see a video soon, lets just hope that's true and expect an early 2015 release at this point. Thanks Jon. Beyond fed up with this project, something concrete needs to be shown to us in the UPDATES section and soon. *Jon says he has only been intentionally rude to Robin?!?* Jon says he has only been intentionally rude too?!? Hmmm. Jon told me in this public forum that I was, "a bleating and impatient immature fool, please get lost." I actually apologized publicly afterward to Jon for saying I was running out of patience with the project. And stated I would be more patient in the future of this project. And with that, I stopped posting any of my frustrations. But I can't watch Robin get singled out as the 'only' person that john has been rude to. The rudeness and arrogance of the lead of this project is awe inspiring. But, I will continue to work on my patience, as I stated I would, and wait for the end result of this project. @Jon...I doubt very much that Robin has beenstirred up dissent" as you put it. I get the impression that anyone who's unhappy with the lack of transparency here is classed as a dissenter, and that's down to you, since by your own admission updates are few and far between. The project seems so far behind you can't really complain about people asking what is going on and the rate of comments hardly seems overwhelming. It's just bad customer service to demand patience when you yourself don't provide regular updates or simple reassurances that some tasks are completed and things are moving along. It's actually starting to worry me that if I even get the stylus and something goes wrong I'll have to deal with non-existent customer service, but I guess that will ultimately determine whether or not I get over this and become a repeat customer. If you showed us an actual working prototype in video it would likely restore faith among the majority. I really hope you have an estimated ship date in the next update as well. You've already been way off on the original ship date and the date you posted in August doesn't have to be totally accurate. I would appreciate an honest ballpark figure and I'm sure many others would as well. Are we supposed to be patient until the project is 1 year overdue? It's not like we didn't hand over any of our hard earned money...and poor Kickstarter stuck in the crossfire as this project and the comments on other concurrent projects you have going definitely turned me away from crowd funding, but that's on them for just collecting fees and not doing anything to keep project creators accountable. If I had my money back from your company I would not be commenting or filing complaints. Im not the only person here that wants money back. I don't see the point of you posting comments of mine when they are in response to you being extremely rude? But nice rant about me being associated with the opposition. You are nuts. <url>"Robin, from memory you were charging back your transaction and were no longer a backer? You are the only person I've been intentionally rude to - but you know... you deserve it - seriously look at the never ending string of negativity and comments trying to stir up dissent: <url>" I appreciate the various pressures , but do need a reply to the email confirming address change... This guy is a cheat, I contacted kickstarter today and they are pretty powerless in terms of getting money back, they can remove him from the platform, especially for the amount of complaints they have have received for his projects. They have said legal proceedings are a possible step if we choose to do this. He has not followed the program's guidelines so we are entitled to our money or the product. But the fact that he is so rude and is just being ignored it just insane. Everyone needs to make a consumer report of his company in his home country and abroad. @creator- update please. Excuse my grammatical errors and accidental omission in my last comment. @Marius, if your Samsung Note's in-built pen is too small or narrow, you can always look at pen replacement of a bigger size. There's one that comes with eraser at top. Or you can get a pen holder. See links below. Pen holder for Samsung Note stylus. <url>"Heaven on a stick" if the creators are to be believed... I want my Yufu as much as anyone, and am disappointed that it's delayed. But I think the quality and real-world presence of the Jaja suggests that it is not a scam... I asked a few times for a VIDEO of a working prototype but @creator ignored all of my requests. This is nothing but a scam. We should take legal action against @creator. I pressed to report button to kickstarter at the bottom of the page. Totally fed up, communication is the key but there is none! Some people reported Yufu and StormTag on <url>" for sketching. Could not wait any longer. It has built in Wacom technology (pressure sensitive). Very good for sketching. Works with some aftermarket Wacom and Samsung pens. Original built in pen is a bit to small for frequent use. But you can get Note 10" S-pen (full size pen). <url>"If the problems are severe enough that the creator can't fulfill their project, creators need to find a resolution. Steps should include offering refunds, detailing exactly how funds were used, and other actions to satisfy backers. For more information, see Section 4 of our Terms of Use." You can clearly see he is - Kickstarter themselves however are not liable. Jon - It has nearly been A YEAR! Jonno will deliver, I can testify to this as I have his other products. Be patient and you will be happy. There is not other product like it. :) William's got the right Idea. Please remember, Jon is not required under Kickstarter TOS to give refunds. He has asked for patience while he makes corrections and adjustments to the stylus to try and counter issues similar styluses have encountered. Is it taking much longer than expected? Yes. Do we have a right to be upset about that? Yes, but maybe if we focused on supporting Jon in getting this stylus out instead of constantly nagging and attacking him, it might help the entire process along. TL/DR: If you want the stylus, stop complaining, stop demanding refunds that are not required to be given, and give the Jon the support he needs to get this to us. Consider spinning off another company where you double the price, shipping estimates, and ship exactly what you prototype. No improvements. I appreciate that a competing product with no extra sensors $75. I backed this at $65. I truly appreciate your time and effort making this better than you originally pitched us. It takes time, because it takes time. If I wanted something off the shelf, I'd get pay for far more for something that does far less. What he's doing doesn't exist. Even if you paid $5000, it just doesn't exist. Thanks Jon. I just want Sketchbook support for android and ill be happy when it comes out. Please make that happen for us Jon. Jon, you ask what we're trying to achieve as if it's not already clear. What we're trying to achieve is to make unmistakeably clear to you that the treatment we're receiving at your hands is not acceptable to us. Us being your backers, the people who have made your project possible with our support. You ask for faith and understanding, but you have not demonstrated that you are acting in good faith and so your request for our continued faith and understanding is unjustified. How dare you tell us to give it a rest? Your arrogance is unbounded. The resolution here is for you to step up and and communicate more regularly and more substantively with us, not to wish away our justified requests for increased information and transparency. Jon, I've backed and received some of your other projects and appreciate the efforts and dedication, however I will say also that part of building a company is being responsive and giving great customer service at all cost- and that also means good communication.. I have found that when companies give updates at least once or twice a month, we all feel like we matter and that we are not in the dark; and are more understanding of delays. Not posting an official update for 6 weeks, is in my opinion not a way to garner trust, patience or loyalty no matter how many hours a day or how hard you are working on the product. Please take that into consideration in the future and I think it will go a long way into building the kind of company and customer satisfaction that breeds success all around. Sketchbook just updated their app on all platforms, can you contact them and get the sdk to work for sketchbook on android. I want to pick up the nexus 6 and use my YuFu pro to paint and draw on it with full features. I think that it would be a much more enjoyable experience. Please and thank you Jon I've backed a couple of Jon's projects in the past and they always show up...not always on time, but they get there in the end. Wow, what a rude reply to people's concerns. We are not dealing with a good person here. You will never have a successful company treating your customers like this. Insane. Neither are we Jon told us already that he won't be telling us a shipping date UNTIL they are shipping (If that ever happens) so he must be having a huge laugh at our expense right now. It would be nice to find a way to warn potential backers of his other 'projects' that they are probably wasting their money. Wait a minute, another WORTHLESS KS PROJECT...? this guy is pre-ordering/selling these non existence pens online and spamming us with discount deals, that is crazy. There are too many of these kickstarter deadbeats. Good luck in your next campaign Jon, having thousands of unsatisfied customers after you! @Walt, you are not kidding.. the StormTag backers are upset. Glad I had the good sense to recognise things weren't right here which stopped me making a mistake. I take back what I said about "stepping up to the plate" Jon - man up and give us an update, it has been 5 weeks since you last spoke to us. looks like yet another Tech KS failed to deliver... :x The Yufu website still talks about shipping in October...a Halloween 'trick' perhaps? You're right! The atmosphere over there is pretty 'stormy' too. I feel sorry for the person who ordered the Yufus with a coupon. This user's account has been deleted. This user's account has been deleted. Jon Atherton, why you ignore messages and do not answer us? Why do you send email about new products and do not give us what you promised 1 y. ago when others alredy have done it twice? I think an accurate full update is in order. Value your reputation, John, and give us some answers My only reason for backing this project was that it sounded good and Jon was not a 'newbie' to stylus development, so would presumably have the time frame for the process in the 'reasonably accurate' range. I didn't even think to check how long it took for his other projects to be delivered. I've learned my lesson now though. I won't be doing this again. I don't care what Kickstarter or other backers say about Kickstarter 'not being a shop', I backed this project in order to receive a product as stated in the pledge descriptions at the right side of this webpage, and in a timely manner also. The last time I looked at the website, a shipping date of October (?) was mentioned. Presumably that will change shortly, makes no difference really. @FRANK I'm quite chilled about this as I now accept this project is in the pathetic bin. Due to the zero accountability model that Kickstarter run, I now also better understand that claims by Project creators are tantamount to worthless. I'd like to add that it's a ridiculous assertion that somehow just getting it when it's ready should be good enough. Whenever you buy something you do so with a clear and mutual understanding that the item will provided in the time frame where it remains beneficial. Getting this in 5 years time when technology has completely changed is obviously meaningless. While a degree of leeway is probably reasonable for 'freshman' in this space, Jon claimed he was not. His intentional influence in his claims being to establish with backers that they were going to have this by the indicated deadline. which influenced many backers like me. I see a few more excuses creeping into this board, along with the endless blind support from Rita, and felt it was timely for another reminder that there are backers of this project who continue to be unhappy about what's occurring. No I'm not here so much anymore... but that in itself speaks highly of the failure that Jon represents, having lost the majority of 1,939 champions for his cause. Seriously, would you touch anything from Jon Atherton again??? I've used Splashtop now and then. It's not bad. I use the iOS and OSX versions so I can't speak for the usability of the windows ones. Presumably the same. Demo on YouTube: Splashtop Window 8 (This guy uses a small Samsung Galaxy tablet to access his laptop) <url>€4.49) <url>€4.49) <url>"post Yufu" projects actually shipped yet? Could it be that he's gone to Indiegogo because folks here are getting fed up? @Jason, good point, hehe, but you neglected to say WHICH February! ;-) @Dirk K. Janssen- good points concerning too many projects at the same time. hopefully, the money pots have not been liberally mixed between the projects which may attribute to loss of quality for this this one. his apptag campaign at indiegogo was not successfully funded, however, i guess that platform charges backers anyway. check out backers comments: <url>"After several delays caused by electronics and firmware design issues we are now heading for delivery in October" I do note that there's no mention of WHICH October! And there's Jon saying that concerned backers were in the minority! I wonder how many people are pre ordering on the website now? Will they get as understandably frustrated as we are when their wait turns into months or years? Or will they get theirs first? I agree with Charles. I am a bit upset by the delay between communications. The only project I am backing is giving information weekly. The only information we are receiving from Yu Fu is discounts for other orders of the Yu Fu or other projects designed by Jon also. Logically, this means that other people who order the Yu Fu (not through this backing) will also have to wait. This part doesn't look straightforward to me. The stylus was announced as almost ready. An information should be set at least every 2 weeks. We are at about half this rate, which is to much lapse. The delay doesn't bother me... mainly because there are not any other pressure sensitive pens out there for Windows 8 tablets... yet... so I am not missing out on anything. What does bother me is the lack of communication. I would suggest a weekly update even if it doesn't have a lot of info in it. Pictures, a youtube video of testing... etc. Anything to make people feel like they are involved. Honestly it's been so long I forgot about it until I got an email today saying they were taking pre-orders for the stylus on the web site. It has been so long time from my pledge that I have changed my city (and continent :-) ). How can I update the shipping address to receive the YuFu when it will be completed? Presently, I am not wondering about delivery date, as I don't let it obsess me. While everyone here is anxiously waiting for their stylus, I just take my mind off Yufu pen with preoccupations - for example, pinning boards at Pinterest, reading books, take tutorials for digital painting at YouTube, etc. Good thing about preoccupations, they help pass the time quickly and lessen the frustration of waiting. With preoccupations, you forget Yufu and the anxiety of waiting for it. Looking at the date that Yufu project was funded on, I thought it was 3 months ago because it feels like that to me, but I have never realised that 10 months have passed away. Goodness, time has flown. If there are artists and art students here, may I suggest YouTube tutorials as preoccupations? These will take your mind off Yufu for a long while. If you like to know some great FREE softwares for digital painting, graphic design, animation, 3D modelling, etc. For PC/Mac, look up Krita, MyPaint, Inkscape, Gimp, Tupi 2D Magic, Synfig, FreeCad, Blender, etc. YouTube has TONS of free tutorials for those. I have been learning Inkscape for the past few weeks and that makes me forget Yufu. @Dr Jude, I leave a few links of infos far below. According to links, Kickstarter is not a store. We are here to back projects and take risks, not to do shopping or investing. That is what Kickstarter is all about. It is "all-or-nothing" as says in one link below. I don't see any scam in this project as there are lots of transparencies according to the updates. We have seen photos of hardware parts inside stylus. That's telling Jon and his team are really working on a project. <url>"We are facing 'this problem' and I will give you an update about that on the 'date'". What people like Jon don't get is that the majority of backers will be supportive if there's transparency, however if we are treated like mushrooms you can't expect more than fungal support. There are added complexities with this which I won't go into again, nevertheless biting the bullet on those and being transparent would have allowed things to move ahead more easily and positively. CIAO! @Adrian, there's an update No.16 if you haven't already caught that one, but you're right, no shipping date. At least there's no longer any pretense of getting a date soon. Quick stop in after almost 3 weeks. Seems like nothing has changed (no product, no shipping date, no updates) ... oh wait... some thing have ... I've been out of pocket unacceptably for longer and I've been wasting less time on this board ... oh one other ... it seems even Rita's endless support of Jon is waning. Have a nice day everyone. @John, I had original TruGlide Apex. It broke and came apart months later. Now I have another TruGlide Apex of later model. I chose rechargeable. That rechargeable stylus is a much better built than the original. It is more robust too. I think it is always handy to have two styluses. You have one stylus in use while another is recharging. John, I found the Truglide Apex okay for basic note taking and I chose the rechargeable version rather than the one with the teensy AAAA batteries. Not very good for drawing other that rough sketches and basic diagrams, but should cover your needs. Avoid the Nota...total rubbish IMO. Can anyone suggest a temporary solution for a fine point stylus to take notes on my iPad Air while I wait for my YuFu? Jameson, you will need to go to YuFu.backerkit.com and log in (or just enter your email and you'll get a link). You can edit your shipping address and other information there. :) Hey I have just recently moved. Is there any way to update my address to you when the product does ship? @Creator @jon Atherton I just sent you a direct contact concerning the Add-ons that you offered after the Kickstarter campaign ended. I've changed my mind concerning the add-ons. Since the add-ons were not a pledge, I would like a full refund on them. Kindly cancel my add-on order and refund my credit card. Please assist with resolving this after campaign transaction. Kindly contact me to complete refund of add-ons. an R Oct 3, 2014 ADD_ONS Hi Jon, I've changed my mind on the add-ons ordered after the kickstarter campaign. Since these items were not a pledge, I would like a full refund on the add-ons immediately. Please contact me to resolve and refund full amount. Thanks, Ian Remulla Jon has already plainly told us all we can go and have intimate relations with ourselves for all he cares. Hi Jon, I would like to know if the YuFu will work on displays with Ultra HD 3D virtual holographic Quantum dots? Because it seems that all others will be obsolete till we'll receive this stylus -if ever. And seriously, I feel now that my iPad 3 is already obsolete and doesn't have left a long life. But keep improving... @jon Thanks for informative update Jon! Looking forward to a ship date!! @Jon, thanks for the added features like the interchangeable rechargeable battery. That is nice to know. I have rechargeable AAAA batteries which I bought months ago. They didn't at all fit inside my TruGlide Apex. Most AAAA batteries are not standardised in size. I am glad that you have taken that into consideration for the stylus. Thank you very much for the latest update Jon. Very interesting and informative, though I would have liked to see some more. I have zero issues with a project failing to meet it's projected delivery date. It would be very unreasonable as a backer to expect the project creator to predict an accurate delivery date at the launch of a campaign, when there are numerous unknown factors that can impact a project. What if a product was ready for manufacture with signed manufacturing contracts, and the factory burned down right after the campaign ended? Project plans and timelines are adjusted throughout a project to account for unforeseen changes in circumstances. I do take great issue in general with any project creator that fails to be transparent, honest, accountable, and sincere. In the case of this particular project, I still do have some qualms though: 1. lack of updates - I did not back a product, I backed a project. I would love to hear about all the ups and downs, highs and lows, good and bad of the project; on a more regular schedule. Regular updates should take little time; and should be part of the project plan, if they are expected to require that much time that they will impact the project timeline. 2. the lack of revised timeline with revised milestones such as shipping date. Were this my project and I had to report out the progress to my customer(s), they would string me up if I told them they would get it when they got it. I would be expected to provide a revised project plan with revised tasks and milestones, and the justification for the changes. I would revise it again later, if need be. 3. although impossible to convey a specific tone of voice, one can not help but read a condescending arrogant tone to some of Jon's comments back to his supporters. I understand and appreciate Jon's frustrations, and know it can be difficult to take the higher ground. My experience has been that you must follow through when you say you are going to do something, and provide proactive notification when you can not follow through. Not everyone can be great at customer service, and so some leeway can be allowed; but only some. Jon, Just wanted to thank you for your latest update. It seems to me that the product is much improved over the initial concept, and that you are working hard to make this an exceptional stylus. I think the cool new features are going to be well worth the wait, and are a bonus to your supporters. I agree with your policy of no longer attempting to predict the ship date. Letting us know after it has shipped seems a very reasonable way to manage expectations, especially given all the surprises and additional issues you have had to deal with. Regards, Joe Mooney @Rita: I am well aware, and accept, that delays occur. What I question, is persistent failure to meet commitments (of transparency and communication) that the project creator has made to his backers, as well as the attitude that this particular project creator displays to his backers. Phrases like "go play amongst yourselves" and "go for a walk" in response to legitimate questions about the state of the project, are in no way respectful or acceptable. If you review my previous comments, and those of many many other backers, you will see that what we're discussing is the poor handling and communication of the delays and the expected new timelines. We accept that delays occur. What we don't accept is contempt for backers who made the project possible in the first place. It certainly is within Jon's capabilities to communicate an updated timeline but for reasons which he has declined to share, he will not do so. Hence I do not share your view that Jon is "doing all he can within his capabilities". My reduced interest in commenting may not be interpreted as representing acceptance or approval of the schedule being shared for this project. I also feel Jon's language is reprehensible. While some customer's frustrations may be showing excessively, much of that could be reduced, if not eliminated, through better updates. The technical detail in the last update was interesting and helped to support some of the delay, however it remains unacceptable that a target schedule no longer exists. Please let's not fight in board. @Robin, I sense Jon is under pressure and he is doing his best in getting the stylus developed and delivered to you. His best might not be good enough to you, but to me, Jon is doing all he can within his capabilities. Try to be patient with Jon. @Kurt, you must realise delays always happen with hardware engineering in every company. All the engineering in hardwares requires great brainwork plus intense concentration. Engineering is always challenging and has pitfalls and so delays happen unpredictably. Engineering is not like painting, baking, gardening, etc where you can readily set deadlines. At least, we have today's update and be happy with that. Has anyone read this extract in the latest update of today: "The YuFu works with iOS, Windows 8.1 and Android 4.3 and will work with all Apps in fine point mode, and pressure sensitivity, palm rejection etc will work with integrated Apps." That is good news. @Jon, I still have faith in you and your engineering team. I can afford to wait, however long. A well-finished, good-quality product is always well worth the wait. Jon, take your time with my stylus. Jon, you act like a child, instead of a professional, you really are a clown. People have given you money, do you remember this? It has been so long maybe you have forgotten. The only other item I have left a comment on is a project called juices, go check out the comments they have received and see what they have done to people. They pretty much said the same thing as you about the product "we are creating the best cable ever made, period." Thousands of products are missing, a very small Percentage work, they waited for a long time to ship to make sure it was perfect as well. But at least they were polite. You need to be banned from this program because of the way you treat customers, I really can't understand how you think your attitude is ok. @Jon: To be clear then - you acknowledge the commitment you made in August, and further acknowledge your failure to deliver on that commitment. The discrepancy, to make it clear for you, is as follows: According to the last published project timeline which you have provided, taking the date from the hex3 website (October), means that we should be at a stage in the project five and a half weeks before the start of shipping, in order to start shipping at the very end of October. That should mean that you are more than halfway through Sampling and Debugging at this stage. The information in your latest update (specifically that the PCBs are not yet ready) indicates that you are still substantially removed from being halfway through Sampling and Debugging. In the absence of an updated project timeline, which you have failed to deliver, the information available to us indicates that these dependencies still exist. Hence, the information presented in your update indicates that there's no way shipping could commence in October, which when compared with the information on your website, is a clear discrepancy. I trust this clarifies it sufficiently for you. Kindly explain this discrepancy please. @Jon: I don't need your advice on my activities, thank you. Instead of handing out unsolicited advice which borders on arrogant instruction, I'd suggest that you focus your energies on delivering to your investors. I'm not asking you (at this stage) to provide an exact date. I'm asking you to explain the discrepancies I have pointed out. It's strange how you claim to be swamped by all the work you're doing on this project yet you have the time to make flippant comments. I'm also asking you to explain why you have failed to deliver on the commitment you made in your August update. @Jon: There's a very clear discrepancy, how can you say there isn't? Your website says heading for shipping in October, you're here saying you don't have any view yet on a shipping date and are not prepared even to offer a forecast. That's very clearly a discrepancy. I'd still like an answer to my questions regarding the commitment you made in August please. I am sorry, I was unaware an official update had been given and addressed the topics that you have covered. I did not receive a notification of that update, so had only read the comments you made below. And the reasons for the tip "challenges" at this stage in the project? Have you changed the tips from what we were previously aware of? @Jon - thanks for your reply, however you haven't answered my questions. 1. What happened to the commitment you made in your August update? 2. Why the discrepancy of information comparing what you're providing here, and what's posted on the hex3 website? You still haven't figured out the tips and battery yet? The project clearly states you had a working prototype back in December of 2013 and yet you are still in the design phase? You might want to refer back to your original project timeline picture of project milestones and dates, you clearly had design as completed. How can you possibly deliver in October if you are still working out design flaws. Also, going back through this thread back to April, you used to state you would do regular updates. Jon, thanks for the recent very overdue update. In your August update, you very clearly stated that you would be communicating a shipping schedule in a week or so - what has happened to that commitment? Also, on the hex3 website: "YuFu Shipping - Short Delay After several delays caused by electronics and firmware design issues we are now heading for delivery in October." How is it your website gives a delivery forecast but you won't communicate one to us? Come on y'all, You've demand an update from Jon no matter how small of an update it could be. Then when we get one its not good enough.. Looked good to me, whatever. Hi Jon, personally I don't mind the wait. Hope its not 2015 though. Would be great if there's a backer's special price for the battery. Also, is it possible to totally counter the diagonal zigzag line problem? Make sure you all lodge a complaint if you are not happy with this clown, this is no way to treat customers. You are so disrespectful and disgustingly rude. @Jon well like Tim I have backed the version without the PCB inside, due the reason of delays. Fornme it's not full understable that you not produced the housing for all device's due the reason of interchangeable. So long till now a delay about 6month for a stylus without an PCB. Oh sorry good that i hape canceled your other starting project. Why did you not wait till this project is finished and shipped to backers? The way Jon is refusing to answer or give an estimated shipping date makes me think that there is going to be a long delay- maybe we will get it in 2015. That may be the reason why he may be slowly prolonging the delay. This is the second and last project from Hex3 I will back. I backed the Nota and it was an absolutely horrible product. Now considering the arrogance of Jon on this and his absolute refusal to let us know when it will be done, I am to the point I could care less how good it is. This company is a joke. I ordered the basic YuFu... you know the one with NO working parts. I appreciate that complex electronic things take some time and there can be delays (particularly when the creator keeps running multiple other kickstarters), but I didn't order the electric one, I ordered the basic stylus. There are like 10 million of these things on the market already. You seriously can't build and ship a basic stylus in 10 months? wtf! No date again. Now, i try to wait till Nov, i will lose my patience. Nothing more to say. Thanks for the update Jon, that's very detailed and pretty interesting stuff. As for packaging and branding, well, none of the backers care about that since we already want the thing. I hope we are a bit closer to an actual shipping date now...I'm happy to get mine trussed up in bubble wrap, never mind some fancy bit of cardboard that'll wind up in the recycle pile. You gave us another pointless update, when will this be shipping. There are plenty of these on the market that are exactly what you are making. Hex3 is already an experienced company so should be familiar with the likelihood of delays and production issues and be able to handle them. They should also be aware of the need for transparency for the backers. I backed this product BECAUSE they are experienced, and foolishly expected better treatment. In future I'll wait for a retail product, no matter how good this stylus may, or will be. This will be my last Kickstarter involvement. Jon, the villagers are getting restless and have their pitchforks up. I'm trying to stay optimistic but when we hear nothing from you it leads me and others to believe that things are not going so well. If the device doesn't work as planned we'd like to know. If it does work we'd like to see video to keep us interested. We've never seen the ultra-fine point in action (the main reason I bought into this). If you're negotiating an outside partnership with another company the way Adonit did with their JotScript/Evernote stylus we would be excited to hear. In short, talk to us. I own the Jaja, and Nota but at this point I think I've learned my lesson. I'll let someone else fund the next revolution and wait for the retail version. I'm still hoping this is the game-changer you promised and wish you the best of luck but patience is wearing very thin. Jon, you claim that you work very hard to complete and ship the YuFu but you did not really show us anything real until now. Being close to six months late and not provided an update for FIVE WEEKS, you have to understand that backers (you know, that's the people who trusted you, gave you their money and that you treat in a less that respectfully matter in exchange) are getting really nervous. I, one of your "supposed backers" (your words), gave you $200 to help you start your business and get some rewards. I have been very patient. I am now asking for a proof that you used my money for this project. Make a VIDEO of your stylus in action and post it as an update for all of your backer to see. The sooner the better. I'm very close to call you a fraud. Prove me wrong. Yah after Oct - shame... This is beyond a joke and other than the pictures we have no other proof he's working on this - I know this is backing and supporting development but with no real evidence of the item working (videos etc0 it does feel life theft... this is a joke now - I've been patient and willing to wait and such... but Jon you are taking the micky now, I will be contacting my bank and reporting this and getting my money back unless you give us real updates/shwo us the stylus etc. Don't the updated terms of use apply only to projects started after the October update? The updated Terms Of Service are quite interesting, and seem to hit on quite a few things brought up during this kickstarter campaign. I suggest everyone, Jon included, read them. Try contacting bank and requesting a cash back thingy, they investigate on your behalf and refund you the money. (they refund while they investigate). Hi All, Does anybody knows if there is a way to have the money or part of it back? Where I can find the terms for this? This user's account has been deleted. Didn't everyone get the memo? We are regarded as a minority of troublemakers and apparently our concerns are not to be addressed. Jon has not been here for over a month, which strongly suggests to me a disinterest in maintaining a sincere engagement with backers. Can someone shed any light on this attitude that backers do not deserve to be engaged or kept informed regularly? It's not like I backed this project with my hard earned money gleaned from hours of working... Hmmm...still no new info on delivery yet? As for AAAA batteries, for those in Hong Kong, I found a shop in the 298 Computer Mall in Wan Chai that sells batteries & small device accessories. 2/F shop and only one there that has it. I've looked and asked many battery & phone shops before I found this place. The amount of outright contempt Jon displays towards us backers is quite disheartening. We have requested, now I think it is fair to say we are demanding - regular weekly updates, regardless of how "substantive" you feel the information will be. I think the "heat" isn't due to other styluses coming to market, and if you think none of us understand that delays occur you are wrong. It is the nature of product development, and it happens. The issue is the lack of even simple updates. I backed another project on Kickstarter with rewards that were delayed by a year, but everyone was civil, and understanding. Why? Because simple weekly updates were given regarding what is going on. What you deem as worth reporting, and what we expect are entirely different things. will this stylus be compatible with IOS 10 - i figured i'd ask since that's when this thing should be released. Right? @Jon Atherton ,please answer our question.It only takes 5-10 min of your time and shows you care about your backers . @Eric Stecho: As Kurt said the sizes are slighty different ,I have tried this method myself and those batteries didn't work for wacom stylus . @Kurt. I totally agree and am rather glad you're speaking up as well. It's rather annoying being regarded as some kind of troublemaker, just because a person speaks up to request what should be normal procedure. It's not like this company is a complete novice in the field of product design and manufacture after all, even taking into consideration that this is a rather superior product compared to others already out there. Thanks also for the other info on the 'innards' of 9volt batteries. @Charmianne: I'm aware of that. However, Jon seems to be labouring under the misapprehension that if a backer doesn't explicitly seek information or voice dissent on this forum, that backer can be counted as 100% happy and satisfied. Hence there is some value, even if only in realigning Jon's perception of his investor community, in additional requests for improvement in communication. @Eric Stecho: The individual cells inside some 9V batteries don't necessarily conform to AAAA standards - there's a difference in physical dimensions which can impact interchangeability. Also, not all 9V batteries contain these cells. @Kurt. This is something we've all been asking for a long time now. Jon In your update of 12th August, you said "In the next week or so, I can confirm the delivery schedule." It's now been a month since that commitment, and there hasn't yet been an update regarding delivery schedule, nor has there been any material update of any sort. Yes, we realise these projects carry a risk of delay. That is not at issue. What is at issue, is backers (whose money you have had since January) being kept out of the loop, and commitments to updates being missed. Please, try to keep us more up to date. If you did that, you might find that you have to spend less of your time firefighting on the comments board. When will you be able to give us the delivery schedule that you promised on the 12th of August? Kurt Hi Jon I'm in on the wait and looking forward to a device that will put a Wacom to shame. Sometimes David gets Goliath between the eyes you will have to wait for the stone to be thrown. The specs on the stone are much better than what Goliath has to offer. Wacom wants to sell at tablet input device and hi res pen to go with it. Only now they see a tablet market being ripe for a $80.00 offering. I choose to wait and have some thing special. My only question is will it come before Christmas? We are all victims of the lessons learned some that have been shared and some that have not, it's a part of the journey we take together. I only ask because I have two on order and one is a gift. Before Christmas would be great. I'm not sure if you are still having technical, manufacturing, or logistical issues. Could you please share where you are in your process. I would appreciate and I believe that other inverters would too. Thanks Now that's a great tip! Thanks Eric! Pro tip for those complaining about AAAA availability (if we can even use them anymore with the rechargeable upgrade). You can tear open a 9v battery and it has 6 AAAA cells inside. Netsearch it. With the recent release of the iPhone 6 and 6+ can we expect support for these devices? Procreate is developing a Pocket Edition if it's popular digital painting app but they've stated that they currently don't plan to include pressure sensitivity. Many of us are hoping this comes in an update. I ask because I am under the impression that the YuFu Pro will have a designated app that allows access to certain features and if this is true can we expect to see it for iPhone's as well as iPad now? Thank You James, here are Pinterest links of interest for you. Boards: Graphic Design <url>"feel good points", after all Jon's company is well established and accustomed to the production process. Delays and problems are part of life for a developer, as are complaints and the need to address those legitimate complaints and questions. I don't see the request for transparency and regular updates as unreasonable. Of course it's bothersome to take a short spell once a week to submit an update report to the people who supported one's idea, but it's one of those courtesies that are rapidly being considered redundant. A pity but there we are. Obviously, we know this is not a shop. A shop would hold a product and provide a standard of service. Thank you Adrian, well-said. One nice thing I really like about the Yufu is the fact that it has such a variety of colors to choose from, Adonit & Wacom's offerings for their styli come in mostly black & sometimes white- it's hard to tell them apart amongst others... OnO; @Alexandre actually its the promise of the rewards which is exactly why projects like this get backed. While I concur about this not being a shop, projects are also backed on good faith with reasonable expectations. Were the historical performance are referenced AND recognising that this project was not touted as being in a startup situation, backers are right to have reasonable expectations. Clearly, many feel those reasonable expectations have not been met, while some like you appear to feel otherwise. Much of this negativity could have been averted if there had been as much effort to communicate here as there had been to solicit funding for other projects which many see as having disrupted the progress here. The concurrent gap in comms here and near on spam for the new projects was the point where I felt things started to sour. Those backers that want to contentedly sit and wait and feel what's happening is reasonable are entitled too; those backers who have voiced a variety of concerns are equally entitled too. I sincerely hope that Jon produces a product that surpasses all expectations; whether he can or not will only be answered with time. No matter how good he is as a product evangelist, I think his PR / Comms could use a boost. @Alexandre, exactly. I had said that too a month ago. As backers, we are all taking risks and backing projects, not shopping. Delays are frustrating for some. I just leave Jon alone in his work on Yufu rather than pull him away from work to answer my questions. When we leave him alone to work, I think the production will speed up and we will sooner get our Yufu. I am still patient as I don't let Yufu obsess me. I take my mind off Yufu with software tutorials from YouTube, also with Pinterest, reading, etc. While I am waiting for Yufu Pro, I have been watching YouTube tutorials on Inkscape, Gimp, Synfig, Tupi, etc. Artists and animators alike, that free software Blender 2.71 is just released. Mr.Atherton,Can you post a video and show us the latest YuFu prototype's performance and it's features in action (specially the ones you have added to yufu recently)? I think all backers want to really see how Yufu performs (rather than just reading about it). BTW,I have the same question as "Robb" asked.If carry case is provided for all pledges ,what will happen to that $15 that many backers added to for "protective case and 3 tips of your choice"? Thanks Everyone needs to keep something in mind. Kickstarter is not a store. You should not come on here just so you can get some rewards. The issue is not about the project being delayed; which can be forgiven, when the backers are kept informed. The issue is with the lack of transparency and detailed updates. Still looking forward to getting this stylus! I did have a quick question for you, Jon. There is no rush in replying, but in the list of "extras" you shared you had a "carrying case." I believe I paid a little extra to get the carrying case provided in the a la cart options. Is this included one different than the larger case I paid extra for? Will I be getting two? Also, when the stylus do ship will we be getting one box with all of our items? Or, will it be coming in multiple shipments, given the possibility of any extra tips, carrying cases, etc? Given the various colors and options I suspect filling all of these orders will be a bit of a nightmare. Good luck! Indeed it is, if you can put in the Updates tab what you have stated here about current status that'll help folks who only read the Updates and wonder what's been going on. I for one, appreciate the information on the added rechargeable battery. This really makes a difference in my view. It's okay to expect people to forget about backing something if that project is a deck of cards or a gadget to fill ten water balloons at once, but this hardly comes under that description if it's as good as you say it will be. There are professional illustrators and artists who are sweating on the arrival of a good piece of equipment and don't regard it merely as a new 'toy'. @evil ryan, you could voice your concern with Kickstarter support by opening a ticket. @Charmianne: That was my concern as well, that in Jon's eyes we did not purchase a product. His interpretation seems to be that we just backed his project, and he has free reign to choose whom he sends it to, per his statement regarding anyone who may have caught his ire: "but as a few particularly special individuals have learned there can be other consequences." While I believe I have been polite and cordial in my communications, I guess that is open to interpretation. Best of luck to everyone. I will not expend more energy and hope to move on. Whether or not I pursue the charge back or if it is granted, this will be a lesson learned for me. My first "failed" KickStarter backing. @Jon: My message to you stated that I had not yet contacted my bank. Your reply indicated that even when you do finally ship, I would not receive the device, and to further stress that point, suggest I contact my bank. I was initially surprised and actually happy to have received a response from you. It was much better than the radio silence. I then told you I hadn't contacted my bank and would be waiting. After reading your response to that message however, was very unexpected. Really, what other recourse did I have at this point? The unfortunate thing is the amount of time and effort involving myself, my bank, their support team, their dispute team, as well as all parties that may be called in to get involved with a request for charge back is absolutely going to exceed the $129 that I initially spent. The principle of the thing is that even with my stating that I had not initiated a charge back, Jon's response was that I would not receive a product regardless. That's the core of it and for me, the end of it. My bank is very familiar with how KickStarter works, and Jon's message that he would not ship me a product just expedited their dispute process. For everyone else, I hope you are all rewarded for your patience, and I do still wish Jon the best with his launches, because really, wishing ill on anyone is just bad energy spent. Perhaps he will learn some things about communication, transparency, backers' respect, and changing the design beyond the original statement and his future projects will be met with less dissonance. I just won't be one of the backers. My sharing the message trail to the community is not intended to cause dissent, but more importantly, to inform them of how I was treated, so they also have an idea of who they are working with, and form their own conclusions regarding this project as well as any others Jon may undertake. Perhaps if Jon hadn't posted this in his last update back on the 12th August, he wouldn't be getting so much heat now.. "In the next week or so, I can confirm the delivery schedule. " It might be wise in future,Jon to avoid making statements like that. We all know you don't know by now. We have few options open to us. We can wait for the product, which I have decided to do, and scrutinise it thoroughly and impartially when it arrives. Some have decided to seek some kind of refund, okay, I wish them luck too if that's what they choose. It may be they have reasonable grounds for complaint since the product is well past the estimated shipping date and treatment from the creators end has been cavalier and sporadic at best. What I find disturbing is the statement made that one of the backers will now NOT be sent his product, in spite of his comment that he had not yet agitated for a refund, merely threatened to do so. Does this mean that, in a fit of pique, hex3 will merely 'cherry pick' to whom they forward the product that was paid for? Is this a warning not to make any comment other than sugar coated fawning? If what we receive works than its a really sweet deal. The bummer is delays and what not. I'm fine with not getting a refund, I gave you my money for a reason. My choosing not to purchase another stylus is whats getting me, because I still haven't been able to use apps like Procreate to their full potential due to the lack of pressure sensitivity. Its discouraging and causes me to question the iPad as a creative tool and as a result, my backing of the YuFu. The feature list is extensive and the potential is huge. The ICS2 is the same stylus but with a smaller tip. That is WAY less innovative then our YuFu and the reason why I hesitate to jump ship. You've caught a lot of heat from your backers Jon, lets all hope that once the stylus is in peoples hands it will all be worth the trouble. Those are my expectations and I hope they're yours too. Thanks Evil Ryan Sep 4, 2014 Jon, Please refund my backing of the YuFu. Your scope for the stylus has grown it beyond what I wanted which resulted in the delay of me having an actual product to use and be productive with. If you are too busy and don't refund my backing, I will contact the respective financial institutions. I do wish you luck with your project(s), and hope that you understand the bad feelings that backers like myself have with your change of plans for this device. Jon Atherton Sep 4, 2014 Report Spam There are no refunds on Kickstarter, you backed a project - and we use the funds to see it through to completion. But since you have decided to contact your bank to instigate a chargeback, you leave me no option... I will cancel the dispatch of your product and you will receive nothing from us. Evil Ryan Sep 4, 2014 Jon, I have not contacted the bank yet (I would have if I did not get a response, which is sort of what I was expecting.) So with your explanation I guess I am back to waiting. Hopefully, it is worth it.. Jon Atherton Sep 5, 2014 Report Spam Sorry Ryan, you sound like the sort of person who will do a chargeback even after we ship. So I don't think we should ship to you. What's more you get on the comment board and stir up dissent - I don't think I need people like you involved in the project? So perhaps it *is* best if you get a refund from your bank. Well OK then. - Ryan I don't know if the refund path will work, but at the least it will create a lot of awareness of the negativity here. I reject Jon's assertion that the dissatisfied are in the minority, and see many names appearing who were previously speaking out in support yet now speaking out against. With the exception of Rita (I'm sorry Rita, but I don't know whether to be impressed by you or feel sorry for you... I'll stick with impressed but please don't let yourself get hurt dear). Furthermore, other than banter which is unrelated to this project, there are almost NO positive or even neutral comments anymore. To continue on the refund topic, Amazon pride themselves on being customer centric and would be very keen to minimise association with this type of rubbish. Perhaps it will create enough awareness of this type of situation which will ensure an improved degree of accountability accompanies the claims made by project creators. For the record, I formally request a refund too for: a) failing to deliver what was agreed anywhere near the estimated delivery date; b) Jon's own admission that there's nothing to update which indicates no progress is occurring; leading to c) having no outlook of anything likely to be delivered. YuFu happiness would be having nothing to do with Jon Atherton or Hex 3 again. Look at the comments Jon, people are fed up, just give us an update when we can expect delivery. You said "will be shipped in April" was that 2015. Are we going to see it before Christmas? I will never back anything you do ever again, no matter how good it seems. Your last update said in a few weeks, times up, give us a date. Mr.Atherton.You promised us to write an update soon and conifirm the delivery date of YUFU: "In the next week or so, I can confirm the delivery schedule" So, please do so .Me and probably many other of backers want to know when we can recieve the YuFu and whether we can wait for yufu or just get something else to use for digital paining. We backed this project back in December 2013 ,because we wanted to back a unique project (A stylus with Pressure Sensitivity & Fine Tip) that was not available in the market at that time.but now , other(and arguably more wellknown) companies like Wacom* came up with same or even better products than what you are promising the yufu will be (with same price , shipping in 2 weeks & no need to buy AAAA batteries). My point is ,Please let us know the delivery time and then we can make decision whether we can wait for yufu or get an intuos creative stylus2 or etc. and save our time and energy. *<url>"investing" in a project. YOU are so far behind and STILL can not give us any indication when this will ship? AND YOU GIVE ATTITUDE TO US FOR ASKING???? Never again, asshole, never again. And, you can be very sure that this does not go unnoticed. Your company will fail. Jon I do admit this to be a mature comment, made by someone who empathizes with the process you are going through, but as project manager, you have a responsibility to those you asked to invest in your project. And repeatedly telling people they will get an update shortly, and then not providing that update is the way you will turn someone who believes in your project, into an unhappy customer. I too work with projects that need to provide regular customer updates, and I know the pain of giving bad news to those who I asked to invest in me, but I do this because this is how I keep my customers, not only happy, but returning even when a project went off course. So after all the comments left in here Jon pleading for updates, you come to tell people to not contact their credit card vendors to report you for suspected fraud? Why can't you come on here to tell us you haven't mismanaged the project, and give us some update on where it stands and when we will get what we already paid for? This isn't people complaining because some other new shiny product has come along, this is because you failed to deliver what we bought into and now we are left looking for a replacement. From your point of view you are working as fast as possible, but from our point of view, we know you have missed every opportunity to keep us informed. You seem to have contempt for anyone who expects you to deliver what you promised to deliver us if we invested in your project. So maybe instead of missing project updates, you can come clean and let us know where this stands. I have worked with external investment processes before and I can assure you that missing project milestones results in the loss of project funding, and maybe that is what is needed here. He comes on here to respond to this but still gives us no information on the product. Kickstarter may not be able to do anything but credit card companies will sure look into it. The only updates he gives are to tell us that there are delays because he is filing for patents. Does anyone really believe at this point that this product exists? Every one go to <url>"pre-paid product was not delivered by due date of XXX, 201X" depending on your pledge level. The card company (or bank) will ask if you've requested a refund from the merchant, so make sure to request refunds from the creator first and then from Amazon before filing with the card company or bank- forward the online request as back-up. !!!***Make sure your card company or bank representative understands that the payment was taken by Amazon on behalf of Kickstarter and creator. The refund request is filed against Amazon Payments. !!!***The basis of your dispute is non-delivery of goods for a pre-order (delivery based upon your pledge). You promised an update in a week, and we'll it's been longer than a week. Any chance we can get an update? We are looking at five months behind schedule. Really I'd hope for weekly updates at this point. I mean take ten minutes, and say things are progressing. Let us know you care about your investors. Does anyone know what the policy is to get a refund, and if it's possible? At this point one of the many available alternatives might be a better option compared to this nonexistent one. Update Jon? I've just been looking in the Nota comments...not surprised at all. The other issue that bothers me is the difficulty of getting AAAA batteries where I live in rural Australia. If battery life is short, this will become an annoyance. Jon says he's considering a rechargeable option, but with all the delays and money outlay, that might just as well be included in the final product @Jason...I agree, the whole thing is very disappointing. Not much to do here but wait and see. I've been underwhelmed with the Nota, it was far worse than the Truglide Apex for the wiggly line issue, plus it's unbalanced and unpleasant to use. The Yufu is said to be using technology that avoids this, but of course we will not know until it finally arrives. Some resellers won't even allow negative reviews to be posted on their websites unsurprisingly, so many will continue to be disappointed. I'm currently using a Serene 'dumb' stylus which is filling the gap, but honestly, a generic pen/stylus bought from my local post office (in Australia) is still better and was around $8. @Dinah, I was happily unaware as well for the longest time. But I decided to look around the comments sections of the other projects as I hadn't heard back on this one in so long and wanted to see how other projects had fared. I guess I wish I hadn't and now the more I read, the more I worry. The comments on the Nota project are worrisome seeing how much I invested in this project and my Jaja, which doesn't work on my IPad mini retina. I guess this is a situation of "caveat emptor". Happy Labor Day for those who celebrate it in the US and Canada today~ @Jason Pearson thank you very much for informing us all about this, I was blissfully unaware of all these things until now... -sigh- :< @james & @charmianne i think we need to all understand that Jon is using technology that was supposed to be delivered for this project in all of his other active projects. He even states that in his weather tag updates. But going back through the risks section of this project, Jon stated he had working prototypes, design, manufacturing, and shipping all lined up and ready to go. So either one of two things can be determined from all we know since this project was funded... Either the risks we signed up for were a total fabrication, and none of the things supposedly ready were so, or that Jon has completely halted this project so his other ones could utilize the same technology which was never mentioned in the original risks. Since Jon has informed us that he had to fire people and develop third party design partnerships, I can only imagine the original prototypes he had were wildly unsuccessful and require a complete and total rebuild. I can accept that, as building a better product will ultimately benefit us all. What scares me is when I head over to the Nota project and I see so many comments about hardware, and software failures. Apparently there is a wiggly line issue that is expected to be resolved by an SDK update through third party apps that may or may not get issued. Plus I see a number of comments regarding support issues which scare me when looking at how we have been kept up to date on this project, others are mentioning total unit failures which leads me to believe quality control is lacking. Ultimately I will take the product that I paid for, whenever Jon finally finishes with it and I will be done with Hex3 forever, regardless of how well it performs. My expectations are quite low at this point. @Dinah...those Huion tablet/monitors do look great! As you say, prices more reasonable than the Cintiq by far. @James...agreed, but what else is there to do but wait? This is getting beyond a joke - we are the ones that have funded this project and Jon can;t even take 2 minute out to gives us a small update, terrible way to treat people who are making you so much money. @Dinah, thanks so much for that info! I'll certainly check them out. :-) @Charmianne check out Frenden.com, he reviews alternatives to Wacom's hardware that are less expensive & pretty wonderful- Huion recently put out an IPS 22' tablet monitor for ~$900.00 USD, it has good reviews too~ It must be so gratifying to find hardware and software that really gets you 'in the zone'. I'm only sorry that I didn't have access to some of this powerful stuff before I retired. Doing landscape designs the long way with pen and brush is creative and fulfilling but agonizingly slow when a client is hopping about like a cockroach on a hotplate! Since I don't require my computers for work, I'm okay with having fun on my iPad and the Mac, but yes, it would have been nice to see some more serious effort in the stylus field to begin with. I always had a yen for the Cintiq, but prices held me back. Have you tried one? I use a Wacom Graphire on my iMac, but always drooled over those. This user's account has been deleted. I keep hearing a lot of good things about Procreate, but not being an animator, I didn't find it suited me much and it was just awful with the recent litter of 'smart' styluses around. I find Art Rage, Art Set Pro, and Tayasui's Sketches, the best all around for me, though I'm playing with Adobe Line for plan sketches and Animation Desk just for fun. I see Adobe has it's own hardware to complement it, but it isn't anything new from what I can see, just a jazzed up Adonit (since they are partners in that venture). I still have high hopes for the results from the Yufu, but the time delay is wearying and disappointing. @Hamish, I'm interested to hear more about the Surface 8, I was a Windows user and tweaker from way back in the Win 3.1 days, and a linux user too, Mepis and Sabayon being favourites, but after seeing a friend's new laptop with Windows 8 on it I was put right off Windows except for a VMWare Fusion version of Windows 7 running on my iMac for the sake of some non Mac stuff I like. I use my iPad mini as a secondary art tool, since I still prefer to work in real media but it's still important to me to get as much of a 'real' feel as possible. This user's account has been deleted. Procreate is insanely wonderful & fantastic with a good stylus- I do indeed love Manga Studio 5/CLIP Studio Paint and several other marvelous art programs for traditional, non-mobile computer operating systems, but I will put my iPad to work for making serious art alongside the myriad of tasks that it already takes care of since I want to have an easier time when traveling/make use of hardware I already own. I'm glad that people enjoy using the Surface Pro 3 and I would too, but buying something that expensive is not a sustainable/possible for all of us. I'm still looking forward to my Yufu, even if I get it in October later this year. ( D: ) I see we are back into waiting mode again... give him/this the benefit of the doubt and things seem to rapidly degenerate back to "Junk bond status". This user's account has been deleted. Going through the comments here and on the updates, shows me that the lack of delivery and especially regular updates of this product by Jon, is starting to pit the financial supporters against each other. I find it intriguing that a product that received 5x the amount of backing it originally required has turned into what it has. I am so excited by what I hope this product will be when finally delivered but i can't help but think how Jon has deceived us by getting the Yufu supporters to financial back, and then wait for his other projects to come to fruition. I even get regular updates from him telling how his other projects are coming along when I have nothing to do with them. I am sent emails asking me to buy and fund a clock and bluetooth weather sensor when my current project is over 5 months late. Going back to the original project, I see nothing about these other projects in the risk section, so I never signed up for this. So I guess there is nothing to do but wait. I have to admit though, that this experience has taught me something about how Hex3 does business. The comments I see by other users on different forums such as Procreate's, seem to get more accurate as this wait gets longer. Hopefully, this product is worth it, and I will forget how this felt while waiting. @Jim Evanson if this was an "as seen on TV" product we'd see it at Wally World soon, but there are very few styluses of this kind in existence currently (afaik) so it would be a couple years or more until something like that happens (if it happens at all- this is a specialized stylus similar to traditional graphics tablets for PCs)... I don't think that Adonit's Pixelpoint stylus is sold offline in many or any large chains/retail venues so that information is what I'm basing this comment on. If this thing isn't back doored out of China to every Wal Mart in the country long before we ever see it I will be very surprised. @jon atherton please respond to us. now is the time to repell any bad mojo as well as silence doubters. if you have a course of action please share it with us. let us know the true status of production and kindly provide a schedule for delivery. @Jon, respectful and considerate: on Aug12 you wrote that in a week or so will confirm the delivery time, finally. Do you not consider that is time to keep this promise at least, after more than 4 month delay? Thanks. @jon. I'm getting excited. I know you are going to ship soon. This is gonna be cool!! I'm a professional designer and artist. I will be using this pen everyday!! So.... Waiting for delivery update... 1 week you said on 12th, come on... @Marius, this must be the "or so" part! :-D @Jon, respectful and considerate: on Aug12 you wrote that in a week or so will confirm the delivery time, finally. Do you not consider that is time to keep this promise at least, after more than 4 month delay? Thanks. @jon. Hi Jon, if you see this, I was curious if you had said, my pen will work on Microsoft Surface Tablet? Also considering there are now two pressure modes (the tip and pad), I hope that if we not using the pad we will be able to set it as a secondary pressure pad for another linked task like opacity or such in apps, or as another possible assign it keystrokes or as right click button when just using it in windows to mimic other one button styli available. You could take it one step further and even allow multiple assignments based how hard we are pressing (since it is a separate pressure pad)so something like a tap can be a right click, holding it lightly can be an eraser, medium for something like eyedropper tools, and hard for selection/lasso tools. This would be a unique way to take advantage of the original pressure pad to give more control to people using it for art where they will have more controls literally at their fingertips since i think some people will opt for the tip pressure sense for drawing and this will give them something to use the pad for while using the tip. I think choices like this could be useful for people who are using this in programs like photoshop, or in my case ClipStudio, even if it just a selection of secondary functions like right click or eraser. it would bring a level of familarity to the YuFu to people used to wacom pens where they have access to a button on the pen for these types of things. @Jon, nice to see another update showing shipping getting closer. It will be nice to see how the YuFu Pro stacks up across my multiple devices that support BT4.0 LE (Note2, Dell Venue 8 Pro, and my Surface Pro 3). I'm really interested to see how it stacks up against the wacom tech on the note and the N-trig tech in the pro 3, the two most common pen techs for PCs and mobile devices. Also considering the new Surface Pen uses a AAAA battery, if the Yufu Pro can last anywhere near as long as the Surface Pen, the AAAA battery becomes a non issue. As I haven't needed to replace the one in my Pen yet and I got the Surface in late june. All in all there high hopes for the YuFu and the windows side of it on my end and a little on the android side, regardless I still can't wait for the YuFu to finally ship. Sorry for the delay, but thank you @Charmainne for the suggestions. I will look into those. @Brian...the latest 'update' is number 15 on the Updates tab above these comments. Update please Nice to see the promise of something resembling a shipping schedule, even if it was way down the bottom of the latest 'update'. Thanks Jon. :-) @Charmianne and Jon, if anybody didn't want to pay VAT, he/she should have taken complaints to the government who impose it on EVERY purchased good. I am paying VAT on everything in Ireland. Everybody without exceptions in EU pays VAT on EVERY purchased good and Leanne should know that. She shouldn't expect VIP treatment from traders. If she has wanted VAT refunded, she should have gone to the taxman instead of Jon. Besides, VAT in UK is cheapest in Europe, so what is she complaining about? @Charmianne, it is likely that she never has heard of VAT before. @Jon, surely if VAT is liable on stuff they buy from overseas, they would already know that was likely to happen? Or maybe she hasn't bought anything overseas before? Seems an odd thing to get snippy about when all is said and done. @William. I can imagine...the Nota, at least, isn't all that good on some apps, Procreate included, but hopefully the Yufu will be much better....whenever it appears. Jon, I hate to post this here instead of contacting you directly, but this seems to be the best option in reaching you. You might want to have someone from Hex3 go over to the Procreate forums and do some damage control. A few unhappy customers are causing a small uproar anytime someone mentions Hex3, JaJa, or YuFu. @William Cron, there is now a new Windows version of Tupi 2, an animation software. It only came out a few days ago. It is 100% FREE and downloadable. I thought you should know. Good update Jon. Looking forward to your product. Sound like something to be excited about. I'm still working on a future of more patients. ;P Good luck! Soon I will be camping by my mailbox when you announce ship date!! ;P @Dinah, thanks for info. @Idontexist, I understand that waiting can be very frustrating. We can go through months of suspense, waiting for our Yufu. We can only just hang on and wait. A well-finished product is worth the wait. The best part is finally getting the pen in the post. I would like a much shorter update, maybe one sentence that includes delivery date. Sorry I was busy and did not have time to post comments for the past week. Thanks Rita for sharing those links. Am just very disappointed that my money is going to him. It could have been better used donating to charity. Hey Jon, did the microfiber tip ever get developed? @Jon Jon, will my Yu work with windows 8?!? :)!! Hope so!! @Jon, I didn't know this. I didn't read the very early comments since I was not concerned, but I'm quite happy with what I read about the Yufu and looking forward to it like everyone else. I'm hanging on to Procreate until I can give the Yufu a test drive on it, in the meantime I'm getting pretty fair results with the other apps. I've had reasonable results with Sketchbook Pro using the Apex and the Nota, though it's not such a pleasing work area as some other apps. Still looking forward to the flexibility and features of the Yufu. I see the DotPen backers are leaving in droves before the funding cutoff. Just shows what can happen when backers questions are unanswered. There's something odd there. I decided to back out of that one too. @Rita: the Yufu should work with ALL capacitative screens so this would be just fine on most modern monitors since it works with Android and Win 8 too @anyone looking for a graphics tablet monitor that is not a Cintiq: look up Frenden & SurfaceProArtist, they'll tell you about less expensive, excellent alternatives to Wacom's Cintiq line (I want that new IPS Huion monitor that comes out tomorrow, but am too poor currently D: ) In general: I am really hurting for a good stylus and hope to have my Yufu here soon (I lost my beloved Pixelpoint Jot Pro last month and drawing on my iPad is not the same with just fingers... -sigh-) looking forward to my Kickstarter green stylus to match my Smart Cover~ c: @Jon. Thanks for input Jon. Good stuff. I've tried restarting the iPad, and found no difference until I changed some settings. Firstly it was much quicker after changing to Brush Cursor in preferences...that surprised me! It's also vastly quicker in sketch mode than in paint, which is fine though I couldn't say it was a sprinter. Because it's such a complex app I guess. My mini is a 64Gb running the latest iOS version. I've spent years using Wacom tablets on Windows and Mac machines running Corel Painter, PhotoImpact and Photoshop, so it may well be that I expect too much. I have the first iPad mini. I'll try a restart and see if that helps. @Jon...I gave Procreate a whirl with all my gear, finger included. I can't believe this has the reputation for low latency/lag whatever you care to call it, because it was by far the absolute worst performing app in my stable and I now remember why I gave it up in favour of Art Rage and Art Set Pro. Slow or fast straight,circle,diagonal. No other app is running on my iPad and it's just awful. In regard to that app I doubt even the Yufu could make that gorilla stop dragging it's knuckles! Well worth a try though - thanks for the suggestion, but I'll stick to my faves for now. :-) Thanks for the info Jon, I did try slow diagonals with both, and the Nota made a line that looked like I was suffering from a bad case of the shakes no matter what i tried, plus I hate that tail heavy feel. That's why I'm looking forward to the Yufu and it's slender lines. They both wobble when doing a slow circle but then so do I since I suffer from rheumatoid arthritis so no surprises there, but the Apex was smoother by far. All in all, the best result was in Notability which has a 'palm rest' so the built in palm rejection of the Yufu will be very important to me too. I have Procreate and use it infrequently because I like the others better, but I'll try it for comparison too. Thanks for the suggestion. :-) Thanks Jon. Nice update Jon. Would still like clarity on expected shipping but compliments on an interesting and reassuring contribution here. Well, I'm happy to say that the TruGlide Apex works beautifully on my iPad mini. It's nicely balanced in the hand and feels smooth on the glass. All the apps I tried allowed me to create freehand straight lines, unlike the Nota which was incapable of that, and all tools could be selected correctly. The Nota would not select the brush tool in Paper at all for some reason...every other, but not that. I've tried it in the following : Tayasui Sketches Paper by 53 Art Set Pro Watercolor Pencil Pen and Ink Art Rage. There was slight latency in most of the apps but no more than when using a fingertip and much less than would be likely with bluetooth I imagine. The latency was greatest in Art Rage, but not extreme. @Rita. I don't have any need for a direct-to-display stylus. Working on my iMac, I've been using my Wacom Graphire or Bamboo quite happily for years. A Cintique would be great but who has that kind of money? I have an Android tablet, an Asus Transformer. I'll try the Apex on that. @Charmianne, if you are ever interested in Siso Tablo, forget it. It is difficult to use it. You'll be quicker to use Wacom Intuos than Siso Tablo. @Charmianne, my Apex is working fine on my IPad 4. Many backers had problems with Apex as they were using it on IPad Air that came out later than Apex. You know what, if your Apex doesn't ever perform well on your iPad, don't throw it away. Hold onto it as it works very well on some Android tablets like Samsung Galaxy S4. I had tested my Apex on many displayed tablets in Carphone Warehouse (chain store in Ireland and UK). I think that iPen 2 is similiar to Siso Tablo. I had the latter product which was for the laptop. The problem is the laptop keyboard that gets in your elbow's way. I am back to using Wacom Intuos. I hope Jon will next year create a nice pressure-sensitive stylus for monitors. @Rita..have you investigated the iPen 2? Supposed to be usable on iMac displays. Jon backed it..maybe it might give him some inspiration. It's got to be better than a gadget that fills and ties a bunch of water balloons... So I can look forward to the Apex being rubbish too eh? Great. Delays in productions and late shipment are always inevitable. Let's not forget that PCB (printed circuit board) took a hell LOT of brain work and the time to design it, when you look at it up close in the photo (Update #14). I once tried to learn electronics by myself, but gave it up. Too hard. Most people have no idea of the amount of brain work that goes into creating electronic goods. At least, Jon has got that PCB developed, so he must be near the finish line. Yufu Pro is said to have 4048 levels of pressure sensitivity. That is 2000 levels more than Wacom stylus. Yufu Focus has 64 levels. I am very much looking forward to my Yufu Pro. Previously, I couldn't afford Wacom's Cintiq that costs bloody thousands. Yufu Pro and iPad will be my Cintiq alternative. Wacom has NEW Cintiq Companion out now, a mobile tablet. Its stylus still has 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity while Yufu Pro has 4048. I wonder if Jon will ever next year create the pressure-sensitive stylus for touchscreen monitors. There are many millions of struggling art students and artists who cannot afford Cintiq. I heard that non-pressure sensitive TruGlide Apex stylus has worked on few monitors and non-iPad tablets. Apex was lousy on iPad, yet excellent on some Android tablets. If Apex works on some monitors, then I wonder what about Yufu stylus? Can they too work on monitors? Jon, if you ever next create a pressure-sensitive stylus for monitors, count me in as your backer. Surely discussing compatible software can be classed as related? For technical information on the Yufu, there is the Updates page. Jon says "play amongst yourselves" which shows he seems to have decided to ignore what is posted here. @Rita, I accept that you mean well but please remember this board is supposed to be about this product. While I must confess to find it somewhat amusing that it is now being filled with counselling messages containing significantly unrelated material because the person whose project it is can't find time to write meaningful and transparent updates; seemingly due to the demands associated with coordinating subsequent funding activities. While @idontexist may not be 'entitled' to a refund as this is not a shop it makes inordinate sense that some of these more outspoken critics be given the option to disconnect from this project and the person behind it. Why wouldn't you let such dissatisfied people move on? And that comment against @Travis is what steered me toward the extremely dissatisfied camp. You'd expect that from Ryan Air management, but not here against people who have shown belief in him and this project. I wasn't going to comment more due to the wasted time I now know it to be, but I am still checking for updates here and would rather be able to see related information. I reiterate one other point. I don't believe a serial crowd funder like Jon Atherton should be entitled to the same latitude as first timers who are really trying to make a break and are going to face many issues for the first time as they focus on bringing their dream to life. @Idontexist, seeing that you are athletic in photo, I have found some Pinterest boards that would greatly interest you. <url>"estimated", not "promised"). Time flies quickly. For me, it seems like a month ago that I backed Yufu. I am glad that I didn't let Yufu obsess me. @Idontexist, have you read the blog from this site "Kickstarter is not a store"? <url>" I don't want you as a backer and I don't want you as a customer. You're an impatient immature fool, please get lost." Did he refund you your money? I hope Jon won't want me as a customer and refund me my money as well. I would want to get lost but I just need my money back. But it seems like he is desperate for me to be his customer and I doubt I will ever see my money again. @Alexandre, I've used Sketchbook Express for general sketching on my iPad and it's available for Windows as well. An interesting 2D CAD and tech drawing app is 'Back to the Drawing Board' and can be found here... <url>"Wacom driver," should you have further problems with your graphic tablet. @Charmianne, if your computer is crashing down with Krita, it most means your computer doesn't have enough RAM (memory) and that it is overheating as its sink (fan) is not cooling enough. Graphic softwares consume most RAM. If you are using Krita, make sure that you've close all the other programs as to conserve RAM for Krita. You might need to increase your RAM and install a cooler sink. Next time, when you buy a new computer, go for 4 or 8 Gb RAM, 64-bit and a cooler sink, so that you'll have less crashes. If you are using a laptop, get yourself a cooling tray that you can slip beneath your laptop to prevent it overheating. Mine is Xpad. I bought it at Amazon. See the link below. <url>"I don't want you as a backer and I don't want you as a customer. You're an impatient immature fool, please get lost." Jon why can't u be like other respectable kickstarters and accede to our requests? Are you really so desperate for our money? As you mentioned there are only a small group who are dissatisfied and would like to get back our hard earned money. It should not affect your Kickstarter project negatively in anyway. On the other hand, if you keep treating your backers this way, you will have created a very bad name for yourself and it will affect your future projects if you were to start some. So please refund us our hard earned money!!! Sorry Jon, but have to agree with Adrian... When I pledged this project I expected delivery of the product months ago... I know that complications may arise but it is you who set the original timeframe. I feel insulted that even after this loooong delay we still dont know when we will receive our Yufu... especially when you say that at the moment you don't have a working copy! Yet again Jon insults his backers. Business must be good to ignore those who could be some of your strongest champions AND whom have a reasonable gripe. I don't recall seeing anyone suggest that they want a broken inferior product delivered now, comments like that are designed to be provocative. What's reasonably expected is Jon Atherton to put as much effort toward those who have already entrusted him with their money as those from whom he is endeavouring to solicit more zero interest funding. Your estimated delivery was four (4) months ago and we don't even have a firm shipping date. During this period there was inadequate updates on this project (our supported product) yet seemingly endless updates (in your spam and updates on those other sites) for your new ventures. To suggest those other fund raising activities have no impact on this is absurd. With respectful and reasonable updates AND less distraction from this project by your unrelated efforts, this schedule is likely to have been more acceptable. You are also sadly mistaken to conclude that those that haven't spoken up are supportive. If you so confident that those who have requested a refund represent such a trivial minority you'd have the confidence to provide refunds and allow them, and you, to move on. That would also serve to remove the negativity from here. Perhaps with the flood gates open that silent majority may actually turn out to be less supportive of this situation then you suggest. Even writing these comments are clearly a waste of time in terms of progressing this project as I don't believe you care, however I will not sit back and see your insults go without response. Of course no one wants an inferior product shipped, plenty of others fill that niche, the Nota included. All many of us want is an idea of what we might reasonably expect for a shipping date. If you don't know, just say so. We have no option but to wait obviously, but it would be the decent thing to speak up. Thanks for the update Jon. I will try to be more patient in the future than I have in the past. @Jon, Thanks for the heads up. Glad to hear that you're gonna focus on the quiet majority that wants a good product. @Adrian and Charmianne, thanks for your understanding. We all seems to be in the same boat. @Rita, I was a serial kickstarter backer previously so I know how credible kickstarters respond and how irresponsible kickstarters don't. It doesn't matter what his reasons are for delays. If he wants us to understand, he should at least respond. He has the time to start other projects but no time to respond to backers who already gave him our money? This is totally unreasonable. And just to add, I have patiently messaged him for weeks giving him all the respect his deserves without bad mouthing him in hope that he would respond. However he chose to ignore. This shows much about his character and I do not wish to part my money with someone like him. Jon Atherton, Refund my money!!!! @Cliff, I also found the Nota to be total rubbish, and since I haven't received my TruGlide Apex yet either, I'm holding out hope that the Yufu will be all that I hope it will be. The Hex3Nota is worse than the generic stylus/pen combo I bought from my local post office! It's tail heavy, and the created lines have bad jitter in all note and art apps on my iPad mini. Okay, it has a fine tip, but in some apps, like Watercolor Pencil, the created line is nowhere near the tip anyway, and this doesn't occur with other ones. Like Adrian, I've been bombarded with emails pushing other stuff, to the point where I've dumped the lot in my spam box, and I just check in here every few days instead. @Idontexist...we all sympathise with you. Really looking forward to receiving the stylus, Jon! I know there have been some set-backs, but the product you've promised sounds terrific! I (and I imagine @Idontexist) backed this project; being engrossed in other projects is an unacceptable basis for allowing this to slip. While not happy with the delay it is the disrespectful tone that is meted out to people who speak up which got me off side. Jon Atherton is a crowd funding specialist. Good luck to him for having the smarts to tap into zero interest funding BUT he shouldn't enjoy the same immunity from timely updates and meaningful information that might be extended to first-timers. As you @Rita rightly point out, he has been busy with other projects and its that very fact which is unfair on those who funded this. Being almost spammed by those projects while not receiving updates here really didn't help: - 40% Off - 19 hours only - 15 hours 40% Off - Last Chance - Last Chance - Kickstarter - Final 12hrs - Unlocked 1st Stretch Goal - etc.... Why am I being spammed with that? I can't junk his email address as I might miss an update from here that I need! And having been involved with Patents before, I also don't see why non-IPR information couldn't be shared. While I've not requested a refund, I'm rapidly reaching a point where a refund and disassociation with this project would be a more desirable outcome and can understand why others (e.g. idontexist) are making the request; she shouldn't be ignored. Hi Jon, Please let us know when we should expect the YuFu to be shipped. I bought an iPad Air at the beginning of the year especially to use the YuFu and that seems like a long time ago now! I was very disappointed with the Nota as the tips were always pinging off, so I hope this one will be worth the wait! @Idontexist, I sense that Jon is so deeply engrossed in his projects that he is too busy to answer emails. Lots of projects in Kickstarter have risks and delays in the production lines. They consume great deal of time, labour, skills, etc. Let's have faith in what Jon is doing. @Idontexist, have you read all his updates and the reasons for delays? Dear Jon, Please refund me my Money!!! Please don't tell me you need my money so desperately that you would feign ignorance of my messages. I have started to doubt the credibility for this project. I want my money back! Dear Jon please stop avoiding me and reply my email. I am trying very hard to remain courteous when you are ignoring your backers like that. Please get back to me. Thanks. @Travis...did you look to see if anything showed up in your Sent Mail? Thanks for getting back to me peoples. I thought I had already filled it out months ago. :S Can't seem to find. :S This user's account has been deleted. @Travis...The questionnaire was emailed out way back in December or something, so if you didn't get it, perhaps it wound up in your spam box. There doesn't seem to be any access to it on the website now. Can someone show me where the questionnaire is so I can fill it out? Take the amount of time you need to get it right. Jon, Please reply to my message. I want a refund! Please get back to me. I'm trying to be as patient and respectful as possible for your response. Hope to hear from you soon. @William Cron, you mentioned four projects that you've backed and three are behind schedules. I browsed your history of backed projects out of curiosity, as I thought you might be an artist. I am happy to know that you are an animator and that you have backed Animation Dock. I too have interest in animation; only I am a hobbyist. That Animation Dock is interesting. I've a long time been thinking of building myself an animation desk that would fit my iPad and Samsung Tablet into slot. But I was stuck for some time. My excuses, I didn't know where to buy Lazy Susan disks (previously, I didn't know what they were called), where to get Perspex sheet cut into desired shape, and so on. I will someday build an animation desk, the kind that won't need pegs to hold pages in place. I am going digital. I want to use the apps, namely Animation Desk and FlipaClip (see them in links below). <url>"Show only eBooks" before searching. Here are an examples of eBooks on oil painting in link below. See how OLD books are. What treasures they are! <url>"I don't want you as a backer and I don't want you as a customer. You're an impatient immature fool, please get lost." I am also extremely disappointed in the fact that Jon has so many other projects going when he can't manage this one effectively. KS policy states that if a creator can not deliver what backers funded, the creator is required to issue refunds in a timely fashion. I would like my refund now. Thanks. Great update. Thank you. As I said a few times, I have no doubt the YuFu will be a great product. Just update us on a more regular basis. Thanks Jon for the update. Very informative. I also appreciate your comments regarding the battery issue and will certainly be looking to buy the recharger option when it appears. I'm still looking forward to 'road testing' my Yufu Pro and checking it against my other equipment. If the Yufu measures up to expectations it will be quite a good piece of kit! It would be nice to set the wayback machine to before all the upsets and dare I say, vituperation that's appeared, but we can't. We have to go on from here. I'm just as irked by the delays as ever, and as much as everyone else, both experienced crowd funders and newbies like myself. Frequent updates reassure us that we aren't just 'money cows' to be milked, even if the updates aren't as detailed as this recent one. I understand that you have other projects lined up, this naturally takes much of your time,but you will likely get the same sort of feedback from those other funders if there are overruns with them as well. Perhaps you might be advised to look for more assistance if you're spreading yourself a bit thin. Hey Jon, I for one got even more excited when I heard about the new features. I would rather get a better product even though I loved the original design. You didn't change it, you added to it. These kickstarters aren't set in stone or else there wouldn't be stretch goals. So I look at it as a killer stretch goal at the cost of some stretched patients. I just wanted to let you know that some people might feel the same way I do, just like some will feel like @J.E. Smith. Neither of them are right or wrong, just different views on the outcome of this kickstarter. Hey Jon! First off: thanks for these updates tonight. It's good to hear that the production of the YuFu is movin' along. I'm sure you must be as frustrated as us backers about the delay. However, I feel the need to offer up some thoughts I've been having. Now I don't own a business, and I certainly don't have the experience you do with making really great products. But I do know I would have been completely content had I gotten the version of the YuFu in the original Kickstarter video without any of the enhancements you added later (like pressure sensitivity in the tip). Don't get me wrong. The updates to the device sound fantastic, and I'm as excited as ever to get my hands on the YuFu. But when you think about it, it's the original video that sold me (and every other backer) on this project! There was really no need to make it any better, especially if that contributed at all to this delay. Anyway, I'm not even entirely sure if those later updates to the YuFu are what led to the delay, or contributed at all. If they didn't, well, then ignore all of this. It certainly sounds like a complicated process to get a product ready for shipping. But if the updates did impact the delivery date, perhaps next time all of this could be avoided if any last-minute improvements were just pushed to a future project. Anyway, I'd just like to share some thoughts of a big fan of yours (and most certainly a future backer). Keep up the great work, Jon! Like I said about John, when it comes to finances, he is on top of it. I've been trying to get him to respond to me for months. As soon as I wrote about calling my credit card company, he responded to me immediately with a personal email telling me he is not going to send me my product. He says, "I will not be shipping you anything. You hadn't completed the questionnaire anyway." Regards Jon Questionaire? But still no release date mentioned in the email or sorry you are disappointed and hang with me because product is shipping soon and I'll make it up to you. Nope, just more excuses and blaming it on other people and such. No accountability or encouragement toward funders. Like I said, he has his money. He doesn't need us anymore. He has his interest free loan. And obviously. Because he is like, Travis, see ya later goodbye. Don't let the door hit u in the butt on the way out. Wow. It does seem unreasonable to criticize folks for being a bit tired of being left in the dark. Jon was pledged over five times the amount of his goal which shows that people were willing to support the Yufu. It's fair to expect a regular update on it's progress. We understand there have been difficulties, and if anything, that would make it more necessary to post frequent status reports. We're not standing cap in hand, asking for favours, we're financial backers who have laid out our cash and expect the courtesy of being kept in the loop. @Michael the month is nearly half over, so we are concerned- we expected to have our stylii by now... I wish that the non-Bluetooth styluses were already finished & shipped at least. D: @Nathan. No recent update since June 2 and no sign of shipping yet. Jon has had a bunch of problems with people and production, not to mention being rather taken up with other projects he wants to get funding for, so we're all in limbo. We finally get hints that it's about to ship and you guys are talking about refunds? Way to make everything you whined, anticipated, and complained about for nothing. But that's your choice and your money, do as you will. @Travis Brady. But yet there is time for them to do 5 updates since June 11th on the Stormtag project. But then again, that one is not completed yet. I'm afraid I will have to pull my backing for that one and contact American Express for this also. Is there a shipping update yet? I think I may look into a refund soon if this goes on for more than six months out from the promised shipping update. Last email I received was promising late June or July 2014, but I haven't received any emails confirming this... @William Cron it is sad to see that your experience as a KS backer hasn't been better, that is rather disappointing... I will say that there are good creations/creators and projects on here (and elsewhere off KS) that are fantastic & communicate frequently, I hope that you (and the rest of us) have great experiences as a backer for whatever one chooses to support next. I still believe in the Yufu as being a good product, Hex3 looks like they are in need of more staff to give us regular status updates & faster responses to messages- it looks like there is only one person handling most (or all?) of the communications here... I don't know if this is true, but we will see what comes next together. PayPal is usually linked to your credit card. But maybe PayPal would if enough people complained. I wonder if Paypal will step up on this refund idea. Anyone know? This BS has gone on long enough. April ship date. Yeah right. This BS has gone on long enough. Look how many of us have to ask before anything begins to happen. No one's asking for magic, just an occasional status report. Yes, soured would seem to be the general consensus. Good news everyone. My credit card company, and my friends credit card company who also contributed, said that they will reverse the charges to this YuFu project. Other people here should check with theirs too. If I don't get a solid ship date by next Tuesday, I'm getting a refund. Thank you 'American Express'!! You're the best!! Wow. He said, "Thanks for keeping me on my toes, update is being written now." That was yesterday! No wonder we don't see much communication. It takes days to post an update! Please forgive me for asking for updates in the past. I had no idea how much work updates were to post. I personally would like to know why the basic YuFu has been held back for so long. Without the electronics to deal with, one would assume it could have been manufactured and sent out long before now. Between this and another Kickstarter that's seriously behind schedule Ive very much soured on the entire crowd funding idea. Neither can I. Did you mean you would be excited to see an update, or that you are excited because you COULD see an update right now? @Brian Where is the update? I can't see any update after Jun 1 2014(Update #12). Excited to see the update @Sven. It was an email pushing the Hex3 mainly, but also just said that the Yufu was "shipping soon". It contained a discount code for a 40% off any purchase including the elusive Yufu. But it was valid for 1 day only. I didn't feel inclined to put more money into limbo, so I ignored it and had already bought the TruGlide Apex rechargeable anyway. There had better be a good usage life on the Yufu batteries, because AAAA batteries are not something I can pick up on a daily basis. This is going to be the issue I'll be most closely monitoring on the Yufu whenever it eventually shows up. @Charmianne Dempsey ca. 10 July, "Presumably we all got the "shipping soon" email with the discount coupon for another purchase...." Um, no. Haven't heard anything directly since 1 Jun. Sweet!! Jon, your post of 29th June says the project is one month late at that time, but doesn't say what date is late against: a month late against 29th June, or another date? If another date, what is it? You were able to be precise about it being a month late, but we need the baseline date, please. Meh, this is still a better KS than potato salad. What a great idea. I wish you were the leader. Because that's how the people that made this possible should be treated. But we won't. Presumably we all got the "shipping soon" email with the discount coupon for another purchase....as if.... You may have to think of something else, just in case. Hi Jon, Do you have any news on an approximate delivery date? Please, please, could you be so kind as to give us all an update. I feel like a nag asking, but this was going to be an early father's day present and I am now hoping it could turn into a late birthday present). Thanks! How come it has to get personal? Why can't it just be that we want to receive our stylus when it's done so we can move on with our lives, and an update would be much appreciated. I bought an iPad Air just to use procreate and the yufu a long time ago and have refrained from buying another stylus because I have invested in this one. Leaving me to draw with my finger for what seems like nearly a year, having an unsatisfactory experience. But that will make receiving this stylus all the more sweeter if it exceeds expectations. I almost feel like Jon doesn't reply to the comments here BECAUSE we're all unhappy with how he has handled communication with us while running other campaigns. Let's just hope it's nearly done and this experience can be over as soon as possible. What reason does he have to give us updates? He doesn't need us anymore. He bribed us all into giving him a no interest loan. He has his money. Why would he waste anymore of his time with us? He would get nothing out of spending his precious time informing us of progress. This would take time away from his frequent communication with other customers on other projects that aren't funded yet. Boy are all those people going to be in for a surprise when the funding deadlines are closed, people give their money, and then he shuts the door in their faces for months at a time because he no longer needs them. Jon, please keep in more constant contact with everyone, it won't help if your backers are upset with you... Ideally for us manufacturing of the stylii would have been well under way as you ran the Yufu campaign on KS so the product could have been shipped right away like what IADAPT did for the Modulo: <url>’s SketchUp for iOS (beg pardon, Trimble SketchUp) but I'm not holding my breath. :-) Happy Not-July 4th!~ c: Pen & Ink is also an excellent iOS app for digital art- for handwriting notes, INKredible is very smooth and works well (I'm using it with my Adonit Pixelpoint stylus, so GREAT!) :D I don't know if INKredible is iOS-only, but maybe there's similar note-taking apps for Android too (doesn't seem likely that the MS App Store has this or others like it, but I haven't checked that out)... Artists and animators alike, if you are interested in painting apps. See them in links below. If you lack skills, see tutorials at YouTube. Artrage <url>"@Everybody - I have backed 60 projects myself and personally prefer to only get updates when there is real news, but maybe I am more patient than most?" You would find all of us a lot more forgiving if you posted regular updates, even if they are "hey, another delay and here is why". This project is certainly not "on track" or you would have a lot more positive news to share with us (which would help your cause DOUBLY, an update *and* progress). Why so silent, dear m'sieur? ;) I agree with James Cobb, pictures please and thank you~ 0: Hm, I've been doing some research and it seems like this stylus may work with Win 7 touch-enabled monitors too, capacitative screens seem to take all sorts of stylii well even if they don't pair/natively support them, woo!~ ilu hardware <3 c: Anyone that has done production in China knows it sometimes be irritating. The Chinese factories will sometimes get bribed to prioritize other productions over yours from companies with deeper pockets. Hopefully Jon is dealing with a legit organization. @Jon, it would just be nice to see pictures, and hear updates and more info about it, just to pass the time, like every 2 weeks - just something to look forward to and keep us interested and in the loop. Show us pictures of it in production etc :) I forgot one other painting app, Hello Watercolor. I love this one. Watercolor paints bleed into each other. <url>"if you still have questions *that I have not answered already* please send a message." I sent one 4 days ago and Slavash had to ask again before we got an answer to that. You are just arrogant and rude and I regret every cent I gave backing your project. Don't bother to answer, i don't really care to hear your attitude. You guys should look at Jons other projects that aren't fully funded yet. And look how consistent, polite, and attentive to the crowd that hasn't fully reached is money cap. He answers all of their question and concern in a productive manner. As soon as his financial goal is met on that project he will start ignoring them to. He doesn't need us anymore. He got his interest free loan from all of us. Jon, if you say you only respond when there is something to report? How about a report on that thing entered manufacturing? Chill out guys, this isn't a fast food restaurant. Let's not rush Jon and be rude to him. Because if this were a restaurant he would spit in our food. I also wish I had the yufu in my hands right now, but Jon knows more about his product than any of us do, and we need to let him give us a product that WORKS, that means sitting on your hands and having some patients. Jon. I can wait for a great product. But at least post some new pictures or video of YuFu to us. Thank you. Mr.Atherton,I have a simple question based on the last update you wrote .You said :"Expected manufacture of the YuFu is late June ". So, Can you tell us whether you have started the manufacturing or not? You are rude, and unprofessional. When will this be shipping. This is part of any business plan. Jon, Please put yourself in our shoes for a moment. How would you feel as a backer, if the Project creator, didn't reply to backers' comments to post an update (after 2 months of delay), but he is posting on his other project (StormTag) which is in the funding stage? As far as I am aware, this is the only stylus that works on iOS, Android and Win8+ OSs which makes this unique since most other stylii only support two of the three environments listed above... I hate to admit this, but Adonit's new Jot Pixelpoint stylus looks really tempting and it is the aforementioned fact (as well as my current lack of funds) that is holding me back from purchasing one. -sigh- July, here we come!~ Same here Soon* If we don't get feedback son I'm getting my bank to reverse charges. Just ordered the Adobe Ink and Slide. Will be interesting if I receive this first. Guys, don't waste your time asking questions: his last public comment is from April, 24 and he doesn't answer private messages neither. (or at least mine) Jon just don't care enough to bother answering us. We are a free loan for him and nothing more. See how active he is on his new "StormTag" Kickstarter project to reach his goal and how silent he is here. Maybe we should let know backers of his other project who they are backing... I guess he might be afraid we do just that and that might explain why there's no $1 pledge there... I'm bitter and I won't back any of his project again on any platform. When in July should we expect the arrival date to be? The First is my first choice and hope, but that might be somewhat unrealistic (I don't know though). Please inform us, I want to draw and paint with precision and speed on my iPad... Guys, I fully understand that it's complicated to built and manufacture such things. However, please commit to a realistic date and then stick to it. All postponing won't lead to another backing of one of your other projects just because there isn't anything to rely on. From your video I got the impression the thing was already developed and you just needed the money to get the production going. That was why I backed this half a year ago. So, the current customer experiences isn't great at all and I am really looking forward to a hopefully great product and a commitment on a definitive timeline. Thanks! Update please Since we are late June already, has the production started as you expected? Yeah there are many pens out there.... none for Mac and PC. Lets hope this comes out before they catch on to that market. When is this shipping? There are so many products that are just like this that are out now. 3 weeks since last update. Any more news ? Thanks I'd really like to see another update. Some photos? Information about apps that support it? I hope you reach out to Procreate, and Concepts. -am quoting the pertinent info from the tail end of Update 12 for Everyone's reference: "Expected manufacture of the YuFu is late June - it will then be dispatched to you as soon as possible." It looks like we'll be receiving our stylii come this *July* instead... I had hoped it would be this month, but it is important to know what to expect and then act accordingly- looking forward to it~ This user's account has been deleted. weekly updates please JOT TOUCH with 2048 Levels of pressure & PIXELPOINT is also released ($119). <url>~ :D I agree with everyone else. An update would be nice. I would like to know when to expect my order. I think Jon should give us something extra for waiting in the dark so long. At the very least, from the website one can see that we should be receiving our Yufus this June: <url>"I'm very disappointed in their total lack of communication. If they want us to feel like backers and not like customers they should keep us involved." That is exactly my feeling: we are backers because we believe in the project and we want to feel involved during its creation, design and production. Look at the project Tado: all the backers are talking with the creators and together they are making a better product. The same is happening with Anova. I think that's the point of KickStarter: we are not looking to pre-order gadgets for cheap but we want to be involve in its conception/production. Not giving any update for a month and a half is seeing backers as a bank that give loans with no interest and that disappointing. I really wished that Jon would have get us more involved. But at the end, when Jon will deliver, I'm sure YuFu will be a great product. Don't forget the old adage "build in haste, repent at leisure". Jon just doesn't want us to regret having put our faith in him. I don't mind waiting patiently - perfection takes time... All true. I am a software developer as well. All people are asking for is an occasional check in... "Hello,... here is were we are in the process..." As opposed to just leaving curious funders in the dark. I have had only one technology project on kickstarter deliver on time. On average 1-2 months delay is not just normal, but expected. For those of you that have not developed anything, you realize soon that god has a wicked sense of humor when it comes to out best laid plans. Just chill and realize that no news is no news. I also reconsidered backing the clock based on poor communication with the backers that made this jaja even possible. I don't want to go through this again. I would never ask people for support an then not let them feel like they are part of the process. Total disregard to people obviously just want a heads up on how things are going. It took me like 2 minutes to write this comment. I also work 12 hour days. And I still have time to respond. Hello Jon, It is a long time since your last update. How's production going? Did you solve all the internal mechanical issues with pressure sensing you encounter?Are you still on track to deliver for end of may/early June? I wanted to back your aclock project but without any update from your side for a month and a half on this project (and no post for a whole month, I had to put my pledge on hold until getting a status update. I hope to hear good news from you soon :) Any update??? Everyone, go back and read Update #10. It's clearly stated that there will be a delay into June. I went to the website and it looks like June will be our month after all: <url>~ :D (or June, but I won't jump to that conclusion now) Jon It has been a long time between drinks - any update on a YuFu delivery would be appreciated cheers @Tobias, can you post any link to an article mentioning that problem? thanks! Is there any news or updates or ideas on solving the iPad Air issue of "predicting & correcting" slowly drawn lines? I'm fine with the delay because I don't have an iPad yet... Just don't delay past the release of a new iPad and risk changes to the touch sensor fouling the stylus like what happened with the iPad Air. Apple will do what it needs to do without considering the accessory makers. Take your time, Jon. I much rather a product that works great but takes longer to make than one that dose not work but done quickly. ah.. found it.. <url>öd? I have backed a lot of projects on Kickstarter and they have all not made the target date, in every case they decided to carry out enhancements to the final product and worked really hard to get a good product to there backers. I believe Jon when he says that's what's happened and am quite happy to wait till the final revisions are ironed out. My only disappointment has been Töd which was a complete waste of money. Got the hardware but it still does not do what they claimed it would. Very disappointed with them. We can wait. The quality must be better than Nota. Do not let us disappointed one more time please. This user's account has been deleted. I'm not sure I understand the ire being directed at this project. Jon stated, pretty clearly, that there would be a delay and what caused it. Like a lot of you, I'm disappointed I don't have my stylus yet, but if I'm getting a better product I can stand to wait a little longer. Definitely looking forward to it when it is shipped, though. Being in the tech industry I have to say a month or two late is not heard of. Hope you guys aren't staying up too many late nights... I know I have spent many nights sleeping under my desk trying to get past unforseen issues. I would shoot more pics of parts being made, milled metal cases, maybe empty motherboards etc. anything to help keep the "I want it now" McDonald's generation at bay. A delay was mentioned in the March 25 update. It's near the end of the update, I'll quote it here just in case some of you missed that: "I know a few of you are going to be a little saddened with the delay, but I hope you find it worthwhile in the end. I would estimate delivery to have slipped about 6 weeks and be due late May to mid June now. Apologies for this - I'm working very hard to build the best stylus known to man!" <url>‘s quality better than Nota. Quality problems is a disaster to all backers. Jon. Any response? Was your Nota accurate, Seekfinder? @ SeekerFinder Paying close attention. John, I just received my Nota, ordered last year. I am extremely disappointed in how the rubber nib pops off the metal point, despite the knurled edge. I had to resort to superglue. Please tell us that the JuFu's small rubber nib will be of high quality material that will not pop off as soon as I use my 4048 levels of pressure... Seeker Glad to see the new update, looks like Jon has been busy indeed. Hm, I looked at the projected timeline & reminding myself to be patient since it takes a considerable amount of time to make something good and mail lots of orders around the world- KS IS NOT amazon.com after all... :0 Any updates? I have ants in my pants. Can't sit still. Need an update to calm me down. :) Thanks Dinah. I really want an iOS 7 optimized notes app. I can't wait...hope it's sooner than later I voted :3 Everybody vote! GoodNotes for the iPad doesn't have support yet. (3 seconds, follow the link use 3 votes) <url>~ I am sooo impatient! any new or udpates :P? I'm surprised to know that the making process is happening here in Taiwan.Does that mean that I have a good chance to get my YuFu Pro earlier? Can't wait for the good stylus. Folks, while we are waiting for Yufu stylus to be manufactured and if you have the free time, have a look at ZumBot - a macro-photo studio for smartphones and tablet devices. It's here at Kickstarter - pledge till Monday,17th February. <url>" and 28", providing that I have Window 8 and Bluetooth on PC? Jon, you don't have to answer immediately, if you're short of time, super-busy or stressed out by exhaustive hard work. Let it be in your own time. ( I am thinking of custom-building a PC at home as to save money, but I am not ready yet as I am only an absolute beginner. I am taking this year to learn PC building tutorials via YouTube before I ever embark on assembling PC next year.) Here it is 10.40pm in Ireland and it is pitch dark outside, whereas it is 6.40am in Taiwan where Creator Jon is. Strange, some of us will be crawling into bed, while Jon gets up. Hope this day will be good on Jon. @Eric, I don't have Windows 8 tablet but I would love to own one. I wait till Windows tablets increase to 4GB - 8GB RAM. I have only Lenovo laptop, iPad 4 and Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1. I have one desktop computer but I haven't used it in ages since laptop that I use with a Wacom Intuos. My sister uses PhotoShop and I hate it. I had use Corel Painter for years, but have switched over to Artrage as I had enough of persistent bugs in Painter. I love Artrage and have that on my laptop and also on iPad. I look forward to Yufu Pro - I hope to use that on iPad. I also have Procreate on iPad and Sketchbook Pro on Samsung Note tablet. I carry 2 tablets everywhere with me: they are light and convenient. For now, I am using Samsung Note until I get Yufu Pro for iPad. @Rita I have a new Win8.1 tablet with only 2 GB of ram, some owners have already installed Photoshop on it (to test pressure sensitivity on the OEM stylus for it, which the stylus was widely considered subpar at best and what lead me to yufu). And some of them reported it running ok to fine. I will try for myself and let you know how it works out. If your running 32-bit photoshop though it should be noted that it can only address 1.7 GB of Ram in 32-bit OS and 3.2 GB in 64-bit OS, 64bit photoshop can address as much as it wants. My tablet is Atom-Based so it only came with 32-bit 8.1 due to 64-bit being incompatible with connected standby at the moment. As such, it should only hamper photoshop if I try larger resolutions, or go crazy with layers. But again I'll try it out and share what information I can, as I'm interested to see how it runs as well on limited ram (as my only point of comparison is my desktop which has 8gb of Ram). With regards to CG software, Paint Tool SAI and CLIP Studio Paint- which is sold through Smith Micro as, "Manga Studio 5" are both excellent for digital art. Unfortunately, SAI is only compatible with Windows OSs unlike CLIP which is Mac compatible. Also for Windows there is Open Canvas sold through PortalGraphics.net and NekoPaint which is freeware... there's more art programs and the SAI fan site forums are a good place to find more: <url>#!topic/bosto-user-group/UQc3ucv-hzY You are having very bad luck with all your tablets. As you are new to digital painting, I get the oddest feeling that you don't have RAM on your computer - and perhaps not powerful enough cooling sink either. How do I know? New digital artists always make the mistakes of buying new RAM-deficient computers or laptops perhaps because they're at their cheapest. Like it or not, all painting programs for PC consume lots of RAM, be they PhotoShop, Artrage, MyPaint, Krita. With deficient RAM, your art programs can all crash with overheating of your computer/laptop and you might mistakenly blame all that on the tablets. Next time when you buy a new computer, make sure you have enough RAM for digital painting and a good enough cooling sink inside. 3 RAM is enough but 4 - 8 RAM is better. If you have a laptop, invest in a cooling tray that you can slip beneath. It doesn't cost much. Mine is Xpad Slim and it keeps my laptop cool whenever I am using 2D/3D art programs. <url>"Just got confirmation that he has found a solution to try out to get the digitiser working, but bluetooth is a no no. Can I PLEASE change my pledge back to a Focus with the case and tips? Only the ultrafine tip will be of any use to me now. Please let me know when you return to work..." Dated Jan 5th: "By the way, I'm got earning any money with this project. This was just something personal for me and I am planning to share my results and hopefully recommend the YuFu as stylus of choice. That would mean you may get more sales from users that don't own a tablet like me (if it works as well as I hope). Like I said before, I'll wait to hear from you when you've rested and returned to work." Both were before I decided on the refund and both ignored. Even the main one I sent that the replies you quoted were in response to asked for the Focus OR the refund. YOU chose refund: "For a while now through Kickstarter's messaging system I have asked if it is possible to change my pledge to a YuFu Focus, with case and extra tips, but have received no response. Now I don't care that it's cheaper (I ran out of time to change it back when I discovered I don't have Bluetooth 4.0), I would just prefer that version since there's no point in paying extra for features I can't use. can I please have this changed. Keep the extra money, it's come to the point I just don't care anymore, but I would like to get a reply once in a while! For now I won't fill in this survey until I hear from you. And if I don't hear from you, well, I'll contact my bank and associated authorities and get my money back that way if you refuse to give me what I asked for and will look elsewhere for a stylus to purchase and recommend. Sorry if this sounds blunt, but I have been patient and polite for far too long and I keep getting ignored. Thank you for your time." You are right that in the end I did want the refund because I knew you weren't going to change the pledge no matter how much I asked. So in the end, I'm thankful that this public complaint actually got a response out of you (probably to save face) when before I was struggling to get anything. So once again thank you very much for bothering to respond this time around. Have a nice day. :) @Syreeta, You need to give Amazon time to refund you via pre-paid/credit card or Palpay. Check your credit card details or your Paypal account to see if Amazon has refunded you there. If nothing is there, again check in few days later. During busiest times, Amazon is sometimes slow to process refunds, as they had been so with me before. But Amazon always get round to refunding. Trust me to tell you that as I have been with Amazon for over 10 years. So check your credit card/Paypal from time to time and see if Amazon has returned your money there. If not, give at least few more days or next week. And of course Amazon Payments customer support said there was nothing, not even an attempt on a refund for me anyway (which I have mentioned already). Calm down? I'm perfectly calm. I just explained myself in detail as I want other people to know what I'm going through. I never understood why you never wanted to change the pledge despite me saying countless times you could keep the remaining funds as a goodwill gesture. If you had just changed the pledge in the first place none of this would have ever happened. You weren't going to lose any money at all. And I wouldn't be complaining if you actually TOLD me there was a problem, at least I would've known you were attempting it. Communication is key. When one person asks for a paypal email (and I give it to them) and then says they're later doing it via Amazon payments and then doesn't respond at all when I asked when will it be initiated, it makes me suspicious. Would you think so? Fantastic Jon, I finally see how you and your company deal with FIRST-TIME customers! My pledge amount has been removed from BackerKit so I can't choose anything without paying again, you refuse to refund the money to either Paypal or Amazon Payments and they in turn won't give me anything back because I have to wait until April to get something, which I won't because my pledge funds have disappeared, and even if I did want to try again and get the Focus I wanted with the ultrafine tips, the option for the tips has been removed from my survey! I understand what the "3" means in Hex3 now... it's the amount of ways the company rips you off: 1. Take money and refuse to give you what you want 2. Refuse to let you change pledge or get refund 3. Ignore you completely when you try to calmly sort things out. I have saved (as PDFs so I can sent them anywhere) and printed all correspondence and have sent them to my bank in order to raise a dispute and get my money back. I have only ever done this one other time in my life (and that was with eBay and we all know that buying on there is hit and miss). I tried and tried and you and your company flat out refused me and even looked like you had no idea what you were doing (asking for my Paypal address when I paid through Amazon Payments and then saying you refunded me that way when Amazon says you didn't), so I have no respect for you at all and will fight to get my money back. I really had faith in this product, but your staff acted so childishly even when I managed to find out how to change the pledge on my own (I quote: "No you cannot change the pledge, the transaction has been refunded", with NO proof showing they did. Removing the funds from BackerKit is NOT a refund) that it's just not worth doing any form of business with you. But you can be sure I refuse to let you keep my money for nothing! I hope you treat your other backers and customer better than you have treated me, or you won't last very long or go very far. I purchased two rechargeable aaaa batteries. And the seller just realist the battery: <url>“Dear yabemm, I just received this battery. I got it for my Stylus. But it's too big in diameter. Is there anything we can do about it (rip off cover???) Thanks. bhw3388” “Hi Yabemm, I took off the battery's plastic cover and battery slipped right in. Battery is okay and functioning. Thanks for your help. Everything is good. I will rate for 5 stars to help spread your product!" Here is another one, failfundlive. You also may contact him through eBay. “Dear yabemm, Oh yea this thing works like a charm with that plastic wrapping off, great battery man thanks! failfundlive” If you decide to order the battery (or batteries, do not forget a charger), I will modify it (them) for you especially for Stylus pen application. I will remove the green plastic wrapping off and battery will be ready for your Stylus pen. @Eric & Rita Thank you. @Eric, thanks for gr8 infos here. @Benny, I don't know how to advise you on tips for games, as I never play games. I avoid games as I don't wanted to get too addicted to them. Two of my sisters play Candy Crush and they are absolutely addicted to it. Although I guess I can't count out the teflon for swiping as it is designed to make things like writing easier. so it is possible it would work just as well, but for more general non-precision use the microfiber/rubber should probably be your go to, if they are designed similarly. @Benny any of tips (outside of the ultra-fine) should be good for anything and any screen regardless of bluetooth, for games the microfiber or regular rubber are probably best if precision isn't needed, with the Teflon you should get more precision with your taps. basically switch out the tip based on what your going to be doing more: Swiping (Microfiber, Rubber, or even brush will probably perform better as they are more designed for swiping/gliding) , Tapping (Teflon as seeing the middle point without the obstruction of a large tip should be beneficial). Although until we can actually see a prototype of the microfiber tip it is hard for me to figure out what it can actually be used for. Because I think for styli Form leads to Function, so I really want to see that tip so I figure out what I would use it for. @Eric Thanks for your help. @Rita This is my old post right here, just copy and paste: In addition to notes and drawing. Sometimes I play games. Do you know which tip with better performance on games like Fruit Ninja, Infinity Blade or PVZ? How about ultrafine or brush tips? I hope tips durable enough and games support BTLE in the future :p @Benny Silver may be your best bet as it is closer to the natural color, so scratches should be less noticeable. I'm just trying to be helpful for people who are looking at the tips with as little experience as me, by providing information based on reviews of other passive styli with similar tips to compliment my own experience. Jon and other backers who have used other types of styli should give their own experiences so we can all know what to expect, or other pro and cons they may have. @JeffTK1 for the microfiber tip it is based on the design, of which I believe I have seen two different type one 'fuzzy" style and one more traditional "nub" style. Regardless of the design it should be silent and has been described as such. But to put it in comparison I have never heard a squishy rubber nub before, and the only thing I can see making any real "noticeable" noise is possibly the Teflon tip as that would be a semi-"hard" material coming into contact with a hard material such as glass or plastic which can cause a slight "click" however even the Teflon should not make any real noise due to it's relative softness so I think it is a bit of a moot point. So really the use case of the microfiber depends on its design, a "fuzzy" style (look up Stylus-R-Us which I believe are microfiber) should require no real pressure to operate (almost like using the hover mode of a wacom stylus to navigate around). The more traditional nub style (I looked up tru-glide stylus for this) should feel like a regular rubber tip but smoother and you shouldn't feel it drag across the screen like a rubber tip. The ultra-fine tip appears to either be a plastic material or a rubber material. if plastic it will glide rather than resist is most cases depending on the "roughness" of the finish, and if rubber should give a little resistance based on pressure against the screen, giving it more feel. As fore a difference between the two, the microfiber will most likely be a softer version of the rubber nub and the ultra-fine will allow you to see the middle of the contact patch precisely (like the telfon tip) but it's ultimate utility will be based how well the Bluetooth works as according to the table he posted earlier: <url>"professional". I'm actually getting the pro simply because it is the first pressure sensitive stylus to provide windows support, and the "Active" OEM stylus solution for my tablet is not very good. So I'm getting the pro hoping it can provide a better experience then the one that is currently available to me (at around the same price). As such I'm willing to take the chance on the pro and if when I decide to get back into drawing then the extra feature (other than palm rejection which is needed to write more naturally for me so is useful immediately) will come in handy. @eric (or anyone) What is the difference between the Microfibre and Ultrafine spare tips? (See screenshot at <url>"dumb" styli on tablets to create amazing works of art. Even the basic Yufu can be used this way. Even says so on the home page: "The YuFu stylus is for everybody who uses a tablet for notes or drawing, but doesn't need pressure sensitivity or an ultrafine fine tip. It works without batteries on any capacitance screen." So I guess they weren't "professional" until they decided to use a Wacom product huh? That's a blatant insult and even worse it's completely false. Like I said before "pressure levels aren't everything if they are not important to your workflow and art style". That sentence means that if you've made great works of art WITHOUT pressure sensitivity, then you don't really need it unless you desire it or feel it will improve your results. You assume I said pressure sensitivity is not important at all, which is not what I said if you bothered to read my comment properly. An artist can do wonders with any medium. The tool does not make the artist. You can have the best graphics tablet or stylus in the world, but if you can't use the tool effectively (ie. suck at drawing), pressure levels mean nothing. It has even been suggested in the HEX3 blog that using the Jaja teflon tip in a metal mechanical pencil will give you a better precision "dumb" stylus for artwork. I have seen beautiful works of art done this way and people commenting on how well it works (feel free to Google). And then I have seen artwork done on Wacom tablets that were harshly criticised because there are some users out there expecting that having a "professional" tool will make them better, when in reality they have a lot of work to do getting used to the device. No I'm not a professional artist and never said I was, as usual you're just throwing out assumptions. You don't even know if all the backers who went for a YuFu Pro on here are professionals, you just assume so. You shouldn't assume everything without proof. I studied Art & Design and while people have seen my 2D and 3D work and think it's awesome/great/whatever, it doesn't make me a professional. IMO, there is no such thing as "professional". Sounds like a word you'd use to make you sound better than you actually are. Does it mean someone who is good at something? Someone who does something that is worth paying for? I apply to both and I still don't think I am. I'm just working on being the best me I can be. I'm not out to prove myself to anyone, especially you. I guess I'm even less of a "professional" to you as I sold my Intuos4 years ago. Oh, woe is me! @Syreeta, after you've gotten your refund, you can order your desired Yufu Focus at this link. <url>"Pressure levels aren't everything if they are not important to your workflow and art style... don't believe the hype." "Not important"? "Not believe the hype"? How do you know? You cannot possibly be a professional artist to make that kind of comment. You don't work in film industry where ALL digital artists in studios worldwide are using WACOM pens, which are pressure sensitive. Honestly, you don't know what most artists want in their styli. I am sorry to have said that above. I take that you are not an artist. Then, Yufu Pro is inessential for you. On the bright side, if you're unable to get refund, you can always recoup your loss by selling Yufu Pro to any of your artist friends, any who uses iPad or other tablets. Or better, sell it on eBay and make your profit there. You will have NO problem in selling it on eBay, as there are huge HUGE demands for iPad fine-pointed styluses, especially those with pressure sensitivity. Any option of no painting color for Yufu? I afaid fade or scraped the paint after drop. @Rita Geraghty Because I don't have access to a device that uses Bluetooth 4.0, that's why. I only want this stylus because it has a fine tip and is a nice design. There are other reasons that I have only disclosed to the creator as well. Pressure levels aren't everything if they are not important to your workflow and art style... don't believe the hype. I am not "lucky" if this is how their customer service responds to simple requests, regardless of how good the product is. @Syreeta, why would you ever want to change from Yufu Pro to Yufu Focus? That is e bit I cannot understand. A lot of artists and sculptors would kill for Yufu Pro with 4048 levels of pressure sensitivity. Fancy 4048 levels!!! You should count yourself LUCKY, if you are an artist. Why would you settle for Yufu Focus with just 64 levels, that for less? Believe it or not, NO rival brands of pressure sensitive styli have as many levels as 4048 in Yufu Pro. Not even Wacom the biggest brand. Nor Bosto Kingtee that has 2048. Yufu Pro with 4048 levels of pressure sensitivity!!! Just think of it. Now where would you ever get another pen with that so many levels? @Rita Geraghty Sorry but no, that doesn't work. I want to change my initial pledge not any addons in the cart. Something so simple they just refuse to do. Thanks @Eric for the response and clarification. I am going to add rubber tip and teflon tip as well! Please excuse my bad grammar below. Poor concentration. @Syreeta, go to Backerkit and make changes therein. When you get there, just click "Edit" in areas of interest and you want add-ons, just click "EDIT YOUR CART". See th Backerkit link below. <url>"You can select your choice of anodised color for both YuFu" was that we would could choose the color of each of the styluses. The survey contradicts the Art Set description by stating; "Both stylus in the set will be the same color. " Could you please confirm that the survey is in error, or that you made a mistake in the Art Set description? I also believe I misunderstood the "3 x spare tips" in the description, and assumed that I would be able to choose which three spare tips I wanted. I noticed the tips are all priced the same in the survey, so could you please let me know if we are allowed to choose our preferred tips or not. Thank you very much. With regards, Robert Morris @Rajesh The rubber tip should be like your standard run of the mill passive stylus, it is safe on plastic and glass-faced screens and can be used on anything that doesn't support the ultra-fine tip, the use for the regular tip would be anywhere you would use your finger with the upshot that it doesn't leave the streaks and prints your fingers would. The Teflon tip's main purpose is for places where you would use a pencil and is designed to mimic such writing utensils and allows you to see the point of contact making things like writing note easier or seeing what your drawing. It should be softer (as it is Teflon) than most plastics and glass meaning it shouldn't scratch your screens, again though the purpose of the Teflon ring is that it creates a large enough contact patch to be detected by touch screens passively, but allows you to see through the contact patch unlike the rubber tip. Both should glide relatively effortlessly across the screens. The Brush style tip usually is designed for featherlight response with almost zero pressure needed to get a response for touch screens, meaning you should be able to navigate or use your display with no real effort or pressure on the screen. I hope this helps, and others can supplement or refute my descriptions as I don't have much experience with styli outside of wacom stylus from the bamboo and note 2 and the regular rubber tipped stylus that you can get super cheaply anywhere. The description I give for the brush comes from reviews of similar brush tipped styli. I'm in for the pro and will probably get at least one of each tip, to complement the extra ultrafine tip we receive automatically (?) and the microfiber one all backers receive. Jon or other backers I am trying to decide to get 3 ultra fine tips vs include 1 rubber tip or teflon tip. Does anybody know what are the uses of those two over the ultra fine tip? Thanks Stretch Goal #1..... ACHIEVED! If we can hit $100,000 everybody wins! We'll create a new microfiber tip (6mm), and all backers will receive one! Microfiber tips glide smoothly over glass and are completely silent . "NOTE - for YuFu Pro backers--------------------------------->>>>>>>>>>>> You will get 1 ultrafine tip on your stylus. You will also get one ultrafine tip spare. If you add $15, you will get a case and you can also choose any 3 extra tips from: brush, rubber, Teflon or even extra ultrafine tips." Where is the ultrafine tip option? Like the others...where is the ultrafine option? pretty much the reason most ppl backed this project... Curious about the extrafine options as well. I filled out my survey now anyway (it says we have until the 21st to make changes), so if ultrafines appear, I might dive back in and pony up for some more. I'm also irritated there was no ultrafine option. I ordered it with a brush tip and two 6mm rubber tips, but I sent a note to backerkit asking about an ultrafine tip option, and saying I would like the 6mm replaced with ultrafine if possible. In regards to Michael's question regarding the ultrafine tip... I was also hoping to add on additional extrafine tips, but alas it is not an option in the survey. I am holding off on completing my survey until resolved... Folks, Backerkit has arrived. Check your email. If you don't see it, check your spam or junk box., So how come in the survey when i am given the option of extra tips. There isn't the ultrafine tip, that is the reason i pledged the extra 15 dollars. I backed for the YuFu Pro. This is a concern for me, is there any way of contacting Jon so we can address this issue with the survey. I highly doubt i'm the only backer with this problem. It does say on the kickstarter page that this should be an option. "NOTE - for YuFu Pro backers--------------------------------->>>>>>>>>>>> You will get 1 ultrafine tip on your stylus. You will also get one ultrafine tip spare. If you add $15, you will get a case and you can also choose any 3 extra tips from: brush, rubber, Teflon or even extra ultrafine tips." Any comments? @Grimond, you are welcome. When you order your rechargeable AAAA batteries online, expect lengthy 4 - 6 weeks delay. I had waited that long and then I finally got my batteries last week. @Rita Thanks ! Update #5 was written on 2nd January. @Brian, I think Jon is back from holiday. In Update #5, he wrote in part: "I'm taking a week off with my family after working 20x7 for the past 31 days. Rest assured, I'll be jumping straight into a few months of very hard work after I recharge the batteries a little with some fishing." I hope Jon is all charged up now - hopefully he didn't catch any flu after fishing out in the cold. Oops, I forgot Jon is in Australia with great hot sun out there, whereas it is near winter up here in Ireland and we have got floods in parts of country. I bet Jon is super-busy now. We will soon hear from him. @Eric, thanks for informing me. I picked up the wrong app. I checked out the other app you mentioned. Great app. Any chance we can see a demo video update? Maybe with a beta tester? @Rita I think he is talking about the sketchbook app called Concepts that added JaJa, although concept looks like a good noteboard application as well. also @william the "Good News Everyone!" made my day. Sorry for omitting one word. I meant to write: you will GET there. @Grimond, I use Nitecore IntelliCharger i4 Charger. The minimum size it holds is AAA. Fitting the AAAA batteries is the trickiest part. You have to keep fidgeting with them until the lights come on. You will there anyway. This is the charger that I am using. <url>"beamer" is used in Germany for "video projector". This is interesting... "Q: With a voltage of only 1.2V, are rechargeable batteries really a viable substitute of primary batteries? A: Yes. Under most situations, NiMH batteries can fully replace primary batteries, especially for high drain electronic devices. Alkaline batteries’ nominal voltage is 1.5 V but once started discharging, the voltage will be on decline. Throughout the whole discharging process, alkaline batteries’ average output is 1.2 V, similar to that of NiMH batteries. The major difference is that alkaline batteries output 1.5 V when start and end below 1.0 V, while NiMH batteries maintain an average of 1.2 V for most of the time." Well, I've contacted a company called GP Batteries who do a wide range of rechargeables (and has a UK branch which is useful for me) and have notified them of this product. Funnily enough, they have a Lithium Ion AAAA, but the problem is the voltage is very high (3.7V) and I don't think it would be safe to use it unless the circuitry in the YuFu is well protected and good quality. Still it's an option if they have something as they recommend them for bluetooth headsets, MP3 players, digital pens and so on. I've also asked if they have a compatible charger too, so let's see what happens. @Rita Geraghty I know, but I'm just repeating what he said which is the following (copy and paste): "I am not sure that there any 1.5V rechargeables - often they are only 1.2V." "it is unlikely to turn on if the voltage is not correct, I will have more info on that during our production phase." Furthermore, Bosto's Kingtee LCD tablets use electromagnetic resonance (similar to Wacom) which probably has a different power draw than the technology inside the YuFu. I don't really know how much bluetooth 4.0 draws, but it all depends on what components were used on the PCB inside the YuFu. I don't want to be a downer as I am all for the rechargeable AAAA batteries as that would be of great benefit cost wise and for the environment. But I would hate to see you waste money IF (big if) they end up not working in the YuFu. You can't compare it to what's already on the market until we know more as the technology is different. And this is why I was so frustrated before. Yes it's a great concept and it will exist eventually, but there was just not enough technical specifications for real life use to stop me from thinking have I made a bad decision backing it? I stupidly went for the Pro version (with case and extra tips) in the end (with all the fancy features I now know I can't use) and I wish so much I went for the Focus. So I've asked if I can change and get a Focus with the case and extra tips instead. No reply yet. Also I don't even think there is a charger that's compatible with AAAA batteries to be honest (after having a Google search). The AAAA batteries tend to go inside something that has it's own charger like the Bosto Kingtee 19MA pen for example. It has a special adapter that plugs into USB that will charge the pen battery when the pen is inserted. Most other AAAA powered devices expect the user to replace it with non-rechargeable batteries and may not work unless it's 1.5V (though there are exceptions). Please don't think I'm a know-it-all, it's just that I have spent years trying to find something that suits me and I have wasted enough time and money to see that not everything is as good as it is made out to be. Some people are prepared to work with whatever flaws a product has, so if the YuFu can only work with non-rechargeables, that's just what we'll have to live with. When you think about it it's not really a fault it's more a way of trying to make it a bit easier for the user while still keeping the slim form factor. There may be other compatible solutions out there but you will need to delve into the exotic batteries for that (which are not named by letters. I learnt about these when I was finding replacement batteries for my Dremel Stylus). Let me see what I can come up with that may at least give the currently recommended 1.5V... @Dinah, you are welcome. It took me months of searching. I had bought a universal battery recharger and I am hoping it will take AAAA batteries. I am expecting a parcel of rechargeable aaaa batteries this week, but I don't know if they will come. I had ordered them at this first link below. <url>~ Folks, I have just found a website selling a rechargeable NiMH AAAA by Emmerich. <url>"Payment to Bamboo Bee has succeeded" in a email sent to me last night. Yaiiiiiiiiii Jon!!!! Good Job!! Can't wait til May!!!! Hope it works with Photoshop on my Surface!!! Or I'll have to settle for SketchBook!! @Jon congrats on another successful kickstarter campaign! Can't wait to put my Pro though it paces on my Win8.1 tab. "Payment to Bamboo Bee has succeeded"? Just want to make sure you're the bamboo bee, are you? Can't wait to get it!!! Congrats, can't wait to get this hopefully on my birthday month (May). I skipped the Jaja, but I see promise in this one. Hope you don't disappoint us, Jon :D Congrats Jon! And a huge thank you for remembering us Windows users. This will go a long way to expanding that ecosystem! John can you create a view of the colors with labels to help in the selection process. Thanks again for everything. Congrats! @ Jon, Hahahaha.... too late for me, too early for you guys! Enjoy! ;) @Rita, none of these are Apps... I'll have to look for them in the "traditional way". Thanks again! Congrats, Jon. We've done it! My tea brewed. I'll celebrate with tea and cakes. @Angela, he answered my first message on Dec 31st! I guess it was quite late where he is! That was a great surprise! :) Almost There! I am so envy of you guys... who are able to order the Pro, and case and tips... :P @Jon, Thank you so much for your quick responses and great talent in developing this product! You have a lot of excited people here :) 8 minutes. Are you biting your nails? @Jon, Nice! When will that web page reflect the YuFu? So excited! I backed the Pro with extra tips and case. Decided to spring for it :) Sorry! My computer still has the time of Denmark! hihihi... It will be 23h. I will be 2 am in Brazil. ;) Now 0:45 am, I am now having my late night tea and cakes. I am watching minutes ticking by. It is morning where Jon Artherton is. The minute when Australians awake and rise, we Irish crawl into our beds. @Gabriela, if your tablet has enough RAM and that it runs on Windows. It should take Krita or MyPaint. You should check out Artrage, as it is a GREAT program. It has fanastic oil brushes with textured bristly brush marks. @Rita, it will be 6pm where I am :) 23 minutes to go. The message in the home page might discourage people: "YuFu Kickstarter Campaign has ended. Thanks to our backers, the YuFu is now available for pre-order at yufustylus.com and will be shipping in April 2014." Folks, what time is it in your country? It is now 36 minutes after midnight here in Ireland. When funding time is up, it will be 1am Irish time. What time will that be where you are? @Rita Geraghty Hum... I use Gimp in my computer but never thought about installing in my tablet, hum... I guess I am little afraid of overloading it with programs, newbie me ^ ^ Maybe i should give it a try! Thanks :) I'll make quick cup of tea. I am carrying this iPad around so I can see what's happening here. I added $15 for the case and extra tips Are the prices in Australian or US dollars? I'm still not sure which to pledge on. You won't believe how many times I've switched! Only 38 mintues to go. This is exciting, folks. @Gabriela, if you are interested in art apps for Windows, check out Artrage as cheaper paid alternative to PhotoShop. If you want FREE painting programs, look to Krita, Gimp, MyPaint. Thanks John, pledged 80 for case and pro. Jon, I am super interested in the extra tips.... considering you can ship them separately. ;) Ok! I had to back the Focus due to customs policy in my country. :/ Still I am very excited! :) Well done Jon! So, my fellow backers, which apps for windows would you advise me getting? Most of the ones I tried are very limited; except for the Sketchbook. @Steve Palumbo, I haven't seen any new info on the case, but it might be better to add the $15 for the case and three tips now. I'm sure there will be options to buy more later, but I'm sure it won't be that cheap. I don't have a lot to go on for comparison, but I was looking at the pogo connect for a while and they sold tips in two packs (not sold individually) for $10, and $25 for a two pack of the brush tips. So adding $15 for three tips and a case seems like a great deal! It is like the price of three regular tips (even though one can be a brush which seems to cost more), and like getting the case free. John, Do you have any updates on the case and is there any new pictures. On the fence about getting a case for my pro. Can it be added after the kickstarter has ended. Does anyone know the length and weight of the YuFu Pro and Focus with and without a battery? I tend to prefer a lighter pen and I'm wondering what the balance is like when the battery is installed? I saw a comment that mentioned the YuFu (I'm guess the basic one) is 19.5g with a battery, so I guess that's the starting point. @Jon will the windows driver support all of the features that the yufu has like palm rejection, tilt, and full pressure sensitivity? In for the pro, so here's hoping for everything to be supported. @Syreeta, Yufu FOCUS is one with 64 levels of pressure sensitivity, whereas Yufu PRO comes with 4048 level of pressure sensitivity. PRO suits artists and sculptors alike. Whatever stylus you choose, I hope you'll be happy with it. Hi Jon, is there a way to add the extra tips to my pledge (the Nickel YuFu Pro)? @Rita Geraghty Can't help it. Just like others, I've been screwed over so many times that I find it hard to trust the unknown (even if it looks and sounds awesome!). I want the Pro, but don't want to waste money if there is a chance I can't use it to its full potential. That's why it's good that there are three versions, but I wish the Focus had a little more on the pressure levels (something like 1024 maybe?) even if it doesn't have all the other bells and whistles. @Syreeta, relax, you worry too much. I am sure Jon is an up-to-date guy who knows his stuff and understands consumers' needs. @Syreeta, I am getting Yusuf Pro for 4048 levels of pressure sensitivity. I use iPad 4 and so I hope to use Yusuf Pro in it. As to Window 8 tablet, I will wait till they have larger screens. Hopefully, that will be my Cintiq alternative. Cintiq's are too expensive. @Rita Geraghty Which YuFu are you getting? I was tempted by the Pro at first, but I switched to the Focus because I also had doubts about whether I would find a suitable bluetooth 4.0 module for my project, so the pressure sensing and other features would be deemed useless. I'm still worried if the ultrafine tip will still work without Bluetooth 4.0 support... that will be a major deal-breaker for me. Hey, well done Jon! You made it. Windows 8, here we come!! I'm super excited about this. Hendrik Will the pro pen work on Microsoft surface pro2 photoshop?!? @Wylie Your math looks good to me. Wow! Good to know the project's going to reach Goal #2. I'd like to raise the pledge a little more and get both a YuFu Pro, a YuFu Focus, a case and 3 extra tips. Should I just pledge $135? Pls advise if it's good to go. Thanks! 21 hours to go. $751 close to Goal #2. Stop, I think I turn in for the night. Night all. Just upped by $15 for the case and extra tips. A little closer to Windows drivers! Sorry, my miscalculation. Thx @Alexandre and @Chris. Now $831 left to go. Folks, this is exciting. We are not too far from Goal #2, namely Window 8 tablet driver for Yusu styluses. I've been going back through the comments, but I can't find information on it. Is there a way to add to the funding to get additional color barrels? Don't you mean $955? Actually, it is $955 to go. $1,955 left to go and we'll have the Goal #2. Begorrah, we are getting there. Hey guys :) If it works on a windows 8 tablet, does anyone have any painting app recommendations? All we need is to average $108 per hour for the rest of the campaign and we will reach it. I am so excited! $2,682 yet to go. I think we are not too far from Goal #2. Now $3,037 to go. Only $3,265 to go! What time where you are in Australia, @Jon? Hi Jon, Great Project. I'am interested in the Nickel YuFu does it come with a protective case or is that extra? Thanks Mate, Keep up the Good Work. 26 hours to go. $4,364 more to that Goal #2. You are doing good, @Jon. @Jon Atherton OK, OK, I did see that part, but you also say "it's unlikely that you will see anything too different in the final product", so I don't know what you and your team would consider "too different". I give in, I'm sorry. I won't nag about the YuFu Focus anymore. I'll just treat it as a fine tipped stylus without pressure. That's good enough for me. Is it possible for me to purchase one without the rubberised pressure pad on it and just the knurled grip? The design to me looks so much better without it. I'll pay more if necessary... @Jon Atherton Hello again. Thank you for taking the time to respond in detail. But you still haven't mentioned if the Focus has a pressure pad or not. You say it senses pressure similar to the Pro (albeit with cheaper sensor), but how would I know which way up to hold it to make sure it works correctly? At least the Pro has a rubber button and LED to show it's on and where to press. The Focus looks EXACTLY like the basic YuFu, which made me think could it be possible to hold it and rotate the stylus in your hand as long as there's finger pressure on the knurled grip? But only you can tell me that. I just want to know this. I understand that it's a new concept that us "old-style" artists will have to get used to, but a chart showing the features you already clearly state the product has on your home page is not really a good answer is it? I don't like questioning and questioning, but I'm still not getting the answer I'm hoping for. Jon, guess what. While it is morning where you are, it is now night time in Ireland. It is now 10.11pm, just few hours till midnight. You are in tomorrow zone while it is still Wednesday here. @Syreeta, I think I might be able to help you there. THICK Wacom styluses are good as they help prevent artists from getting corns on fingers or hand cramps from prolonged holding of pens. If you still have Wacom Stylus and Intuos or Bamboo tablet, you can use tablet correctly by placing it directly in front of monitor or laptop screen, not angling it away from screen. Try this approach and see if this makes any differences to your sense of co-ordination. Sit your Wacom tablet strictly in front of monitor, making sure that top length of tablet is visibly in parallel to that of monitor. For your wrist's comfort, you can optionally raise your tablet by 15 degree or more. I use this approach for digital sketching and sculpting. I use Wacom Intuos Pro. I have Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1. The stylus is fine-pointed and it is great. It is Wacom-activated, though it is skinny. As my hands are small, I love this fine stylus. I can do sketching on Samsung Galaxy Note tablet, but pity it lacks Artrage and Procreate, these two great paintings apps for Ipad only. My iPad doesn't recognise Samsung Note pen. So that's why I must have Yufu for iPad. If you wish to try digital painting and that you'd like free painting programs, check out Krita, MyPaint and Gimp. These are FREE. For your iPad, check out Artrage and Procreate. They cost you under $5 each. @Rita Geraghty You're not wrong there. I haven't drawn in ages (I sculpt figures a lot now though). Then recently I was asked to design a poster and used my Prismacolor pencils to do it and suddenly the desire came back to me. I remembered all the attempts I tried to get into digital art and failed. Wacom styluses are too thick and I just couldn't get over the hand-eye disconnect. Can't afford a cintiq (but have heard they have issues that make them not worth the money) and when I tried an alternative cintiq (yiynova WDP10) I wasted a lot of money on a piece of junk. Building a DIY cinctiq gave too many issues and wasn't cost effective (as I wanted to have something small). So when I saw the YuFu, I thought "here's a method I haven't tried and it reminds me of my traditional art tools. It looks like ME". So I really do want this project to succeed, but I want to make sure this isn't just yet another promise made that can't be fulfilled. Why won't Jon tell us what we want to know? The home page needs an update! @Syreeta, I bet you are an artist to badly want this Yufu stylus. @Rita Geraghty Yeah. My dad stupidly named after the singer. I only say "stupidly" because people often mispronounce it or spell it wrong and it gets annoying after the umpteenth time! Sometimes I wish I had a common name or one maybe easier to spell? I did back the Neptune Pine for a while (until there was about 10 days left) and then something inside just said "no" so I cancelled and bought a Sony Xperia Active instead. I really do want this stylus as I'm determined to build a small capacitive display to use it on, but I'm so afraid of it being so awkward for me to use that it ends up gathering dust. @Syreeta Wright, hasn't your famous namesake passed away in July 6, 2004. May God rest her soul. Oops, my mistake again. Only $5,356 more towards Goal #2 which is Window 8 tablet driver for Yufu stylus. Is your name really Syreeta Wright? Folks, I made miscalculations 20 minutes ago. Sorry about that. Almost $10,000 more toward Goal #2. @Syreeta. I know what you mean. I am sure Jon Atherton understands backers' needs and hopefully can deliver the goods. Have you backed iPen 2 previously? I had pre-ordered that one months ago and never saw the good. I am confident enough with Jon Artherton. So I am going with this project Yufu. @Rita Geraghty I don't think you understood what I was on about. My issue is not the shape of the stylus and never was (and the grip where your fingers go is round not hexagonal, so your idea about Sugru is moot I'm afraid), but rather having clearer, more detailed information about it. After looking at the product's timeline I feel there should be a better demo video and examples of the pressure sensor in action. As I said, the YuFu Focus has pressure sensitivity but doesn't have the rubberised pressure pad like the Pro which helps to indicate how it should be held. So how does the Focus work in comparison to the Pro? Backers has asked this several times and there has been no answer for it. Not everyone is willing to take chances if there is not enough to keep them interested. The only selling point is the "ultrafine" one on the stylus. I just like to have perfectly valid questions answered. Is that so much to ask? It's like the issue is being deliberately avoided... 29 hours left to go. Still $5554 more to reach Goal #2. Will we make it? @Syreeta, I forgot to suggest Sugru for your hexagonal shape of your Yufu. You can knock the Sugru clay into any shape you like and let it dry for 24 hours. Use Sugru to make a rubber grip for your stylus. Shape it for your fingers' comfort. @Syreeta, you'll just have wait and see the stylus in the post. Only then will you know if it is satisfactory to your liking. I oftentimes take chances on projects and purchases online. I hope Yufu is as good as our expectations. I have trust in this product. I downgraded my pledge to a YuFu Focus. I am not completely convinced on the YuFu Pro and even the whole range (only the thought of a nice fine tip is keeping me here). The problem I have is that there is clearly not enough information about how the product properly works in real life use and if it would be really as comfortable to use as said. It just looks like loads of marketing hype. Why isn't there a video of fully working prototype being used by an artist showing its capability, since it's been said that Jon has work with artists and such to make this the perfect stylus? I had sent a message to Jon asking about how the Focus senses pressure since in the images it doesn't show the "textured rubber switch and pressure pad" (nor does it mention it in the text). So I thought maybe it senses the pressure differently to the Pro (you'll see where I'm going with this shortly). So after I got a reply from Jon about if the Focus uses the same method of pressure sensing as the Pro (which it does, but it has less sensors), I asked the following 2 days ago and have had no response yet: "Thanks for the reply. So will there be a rubberised button on the Focus as well (still prefer the cleaner design without it, but NEED that ultrafine tip!)? It's just that I tend to turn my pen/pencil when occasionally while I draw (habit taken from when using woodcased pencils where you would turn the pencil to use the unworn side of the point and to relieve the discomfort from holding a hexagonal shape for so long) and it would be very difficult to adapt. I like the idea that the Focus has room for spare tips meaning it's overall lighter (which is a good thing), but it's a shame the pressure levels are so low (I would need more than 64, but way less than 4000+!). I never did notice but is palm rejection limited to the Pro version only, or is it available on the Focus too? It's just that the images look like a basic YuFu with an ultrafine point on the end and doesn't really show if it differs that much when it comes to the pressure levels. I'm hoping there will be updated images soon so I can make up my mind before the campaign ends..." If the Focus will allow me to hold it around the knurled grip on ANY side, I would consider it better than the Pro as I don't want to have to adapt my grip (which may change my drawing style) and I'm prepared to live without the high pressure levels (even had an Intuos 4 once and never really cared). I still have the thought of the pressure sensor in the grip bothering me. Anyone I've told this to has thought it to be crazy! Also another backer BEFORE I pledged asked for a comparison of palm rejection between the Focus and Pro. I read through ALL the comments and never saw an answer to that which is a worry too. I understand that obviously Jon and others working with him are busy (and of course it's New Year's Day today too), but questions like this should've been answered long ago and shouldn't still be asked now, especially when it's so close to the campaign's end. It's not like I can read the minds of the developers and am able to see 2D images in 3D. I dropped to the Focus with the mindset that if this thing does not work as promised, it's less of a loss of money than the Pro alone (as I opted for the case and extra tips too with the Focus to make it more worthwhile). I would LOVE to be proved wrong about this, but it's not looking hopeful. I'm surprised I'm the only one here that has mentioned or even noticed this...! Happy New Year, world. Raised my pledge. Final push time, we can do it!! 59 hours to go, folks. Are you excited? Jon, will you be able to post any pictures of actual Nickel version for us to see before the campaign is over? It looks like it might be a very dark, almost black finish in the sample picture of the objects you posted earlier, correct? Sorry, I meant Google+. Spread word too at iGoogle. Jon Atherton's words: "Stretch Goal #2..... If we hit $130,000 we'll create a Windows 8 Tablet driver so you you can use the YuFu on the new Windows 8 Tablets, even the larger ones that are coming out soon - as long as they support Bluetooth LE." Backers, we need $12K more to reach Goal #2. Let's spread the word on Yufu. The BEST places to advertise Yufu by words of mouth are through Facebook, YouTube, forums for artists and writers alike. Target app tutorials at YouTube where you can drop words. Some tutors like Vscorpianc and Lynda.com get million hits at YouTube, depending on which tutorials get most hits. Don't forget Yahoo Answers! And Quora. 1,641 backers - $117,141 pledged of $25,000 goal - 71 hours to go Just recording. Experimentally, I have just a minute ago spread words on Yufu Pro at Facebook in artists' groups. I wonder how many will respond to my ads by words of mouth. Just curious. Any comparison shots with other fine point stylus? e.g Jot Script (Evernote Editions)? Hey Jon Where are those videos demonstrating the multiple nibs, and how the pressure sensor works. Also the prototype case? You mentioned having a video up two weeks ago. I decided to back for the Yufu Pro none-the-less. But I would still prefer you keep your word on that matter. Overall good job, and thank you for this product can't wait till it ships. Michael @Jon Could you consider a Dark lines on Black YuFu option please and thanks?! Can I use the pen for annotating PDFs or PowerPoint prensentations while presenting on a beamer? Don't forget to spread words at Facebook as well. Folks, to hit Goal #2, we need to spread the words. The best places to attract backers would be YouTube, forums for painting & writing apps and programs.

Yes they will work" Thanks for clarifying Jon... So get back from your holidays pronto & get your marketing on!! You have 4 days to get another $20k! C'mon, we need this thing to run on Windows! Hendrik *about *YuFu *turn @ Jon Atherton I know... it's just that people (not necessarily here, but elsewhere talking about the choice of battery for the YuFu) have been complaining that it's a hard battery to find and I just shared that option if people found it a really big deal. You're right tabout the rechargeables and I was going to mention I haven't seen any with 1.5V. Would the YuFU fail to trun on if a recharageable battery was used or would it just give poor performance? "@H - it can only work on touch screens" Erm, naturally... But there are now many touch screen (most are AIO PCs) that are not tablets. They run Windows 8/8.1, which are designed for touch. These systems do not run on Windows RT... Will the Yufu work on these with the pressure sensitivity feature if you develop a Windows 8 driver? Hope the question is clear now... Thanks, Hendrik @ Jon Atherton I'm not daft, I know they are not rechargeable! I said "I suppose they can be used in a pinch, but it's better to buy rechargeable ones". As in if you have something you're desperate to finish and all that's left is a 9V, you might be able to scrape by until you can buy proper AAAA batteries. I've never tried it as I can source rechargeable AAAA easily online. The hard part is finding ones with a good capacity. But people have mentioned it does work, but like I said in a pinch. And I'd still like to know more about the YuFu Focus as I mentioned in my message to you. If that's not too much trouble. :) Should we reach the stretch goal, would it be compatible with Windows RT/RT8.1 or just full Windows 8/8.1? Ok thanks! Just bumped my pledge to a Focus. I take a ton of notes in my classes and do technical diagrams for them. Jon, You probably missed my earlier question among all the others... Could you please confirm if your Windows 8 stretch goal driver will also work on Windows 8.1, NON-tablet touch screens? Or will it be limited to Windows RT / tablet version? Tnx, Hendrik Apparently you can open up a 9V battery and find SIX AAAA batteries inside! Of course there are certain brands that do this and you have to be careful opening them: <url>~ :3 Thank you, Mr. Atherton, EVERYONE gets the thin microfiber tip included too, YAY!~ :D (posting out of gratitude & to answer this question for those who don't know yet) see here for the source: <url>＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝＝ It's a good idea. My old stylus is Maglus. It is magnetic and clings nicely to the side of your iPad — even if you're using a Smart Cover. I like that design and l hope YuFu allows everyone to customize. I want to receive both a YuFu Pro ($65,-) and a YuFu Focus ($55,-) total $120,- I have pledged $120. Will that work? If I need to do another method, please let me know. Suggestion: a removable pen clip that has a magnet on the end. Optional to add to the pledge amount for it. Just like a removable clip on some pens and flashlights, with a magnet on the end of the clip allowing it to snap to many of the covers of the iPad. April 2014 - I can't wait to get my hands on Yufu Pro on that month. I wanna paint. 9 more days till funding time, this is getting exciting. Looking at the Focus, can I expect that it will not show the symptom in the video if we are using compatible applications? e.g. I will only miss the palm rejections by not going Pro, or will the accelerometer in Pro will enhance it to have greater accuracy even if we are using the pen at angle? I am referring to this <url>"the pressure sensor is in grip not the tip" and that "no pressure is required so you won't scratch your screen". Would you elaborate on this a little more for me? Does this mean I have to hold the stylus by the knurled grip as opposed to higher up the body to get the pressure sensitivity to work? Also, 4048 levels of pressure sensitivity is AMAZING!! How does it stack up against the Jot Touch 4? Would you consider doing a side by side video comparison of the two? Keep up the great work!! Thanks Gene This user's account has been deleted. Some Questions: 1. Want to confirm the $99 pro includes 6 tips total (2 for pro, 1 for standard yufu, and 3 extra tips). 2. Can you please consider redesigning the case so it's doesn't take up more space than it needs to? Eg. a standard flat rectangular pencil case so it's actually useful rather than just having the hex shape look to match the stylus? 3. I actually believe the hex shaped stylus is not as comfortable as a rounded one. It should actually be cheaper to manufacture as well. Would you please consider adding a rounded design stylus to be selectable if you meet a goal, say $100k ? thanks. Howdy Jon, I see the iPad and Android tablets being talked about mostly. 1. Will the YuFu and Nota work well with smartphones? 2. Would the YuFu Focus and Pro work better than the basic YuFu on smartphones? Thanks and I applaud your work in the digital stylus space! I am like many in that the Nota I pledged for is being superseded by a product that trumps it in every way (more features, smaller nib, smaller barrel diameter, etc) but I actually kind of like that. The great thing about smartphones and PC hardware is that if you want the latest and greatest- it is always there for you. Sure what you buy may become outdated in a mere months, but it just means that the cutting-edge is always within reach instead of the ever-distance 'major leap in performance once every few years.' I think your progression of stylus designs is like that- keep it up! I'm looking forward to the YuFu Extreme Pro 7th edition next year in May ;) Jon, I was wondering if ArtRage is going to ignore you again? What about Paper? It's my favorite app next to Procreate. Please add support for it! Hi Jon, I'm reading various things about existing pressure sensitive styli having issues on the iPad Air & Retina Mini. The Pogo Connect isn't working with them at all and TenOne say it is unlikely to because it's a hardware issue. The Wacom Intuos stylus isn't responding well either which they think can be fixed via firmware. Will you be testing the YuFu on the Air & Retina Mini to ensure there is no issue? Cheers. Jon does the Yufu pro work like the nota when not using the Bluetooth features as just a fine tip stylus in any app? Would it be possible for you to release a video of the focus's palm rejection vs the pro's? How much longer do you expect the battery life in the focus to last than the pro? Also, how much better is the palm rejection in the pro than in the focus? I'm still debating on which one I want to get. I'll be using the stylus pretty much to only take notes so I don't necessarily need all the extra features in the pro however would consider the pro if the palm rejection was significantly better than the focus. Thanks! Jon. In addition to notes and drawing. Sometimes I play games. Do you know which tip with better performance on games like Fruit Ninja, Infinity Blade or PVZ? How about ultrafine or brush tips? I hope tips durable enough and games support BTLE in the future :p Anyway, I would recommend YuFu to all my friends. Keep it up. Will the Yufu Pro reward for $65 include a spare tip? Is there palm rejection in the YuFu Jon Thanks for the clarification. What is the difference between yufu pro and yufu pro art set? What is the extra yufu for brush work- is that an extra yufu? Thanks This looks to be the exact thing I've been looking for. All of the other styli that have been made so far are a bit bulky or just plain freaky feeling when I've held them. What I've really wanted was one that felt like my beloved mechanical pencils. Do you have any estimate as to how long the ultrafine tips will last? I know that on other styli that the tips end up being a consumable resource. YuFu Pro works 100% with Ipad Mini Retina? Thanks Jon :) Hi there: I have found rechargeable batteries at Radio Shack (Dantona "AAAA" 1.2V/300mAh Ni-MH Battery #:AAAA-300NM). I do not know if because the voltage is below 1.5 there could be a problem in connecting properly. Any ideas? Thanks Thanks a lot, Jon. Battery life is satisfactory. Does it with power on and off switch, and also the power LED like Nota? Jon, will the yufu pro work on the ipad 2? I wanted to receive 2x $25 YuFu basic adn 1 $49 Yufu Focus. I pledged $99. I hope that will work. If I need to do another method, please let me know. Does the ultra fine tip work on android tablets? I'm specifically interested in using it with the Nexus 7 FHD. Thanks Jon If I am incorrect why does the timeline here shows shipping in February? <url>"The Pro and the Focus will work on any tablet that supports Bluetooth 4", but I'm concerned because that was immediately followed by "when App developers update their Apps," as well as the comment "it's great that Android now supports BluetoothLE, it's important to check on your device though to make sure it is supported in the hardware." My question is meant to cover the broad spectrum (all Bluetooth4 users), but for my specific case, I'm talking about a Windows8 tablet and touch-screen laptop, and common Windows programs like Office and Paintbrush. (At least for now - maybe I'll get note-taking apps later). Do those count as Apps that need to be updated to work with your SDK? Adonit Jot Script appears to be Apple only. I had give up my Early-Bird slot (ie, cheap) for the TruGlide Apex for the same reason. You guys seem to have solved that problem. I'm hoping the Focus will work for me, since it's currently (at Early-Bird price) the same cost as the Nota but much sexier (plus I like the idea of a cap) Whenever you get a chance we'd love to see a demo of the various tips, and their responsiveness. The JaJa is amazingly good with the Teflon tip, so I'd expect the same, or preferably better response on the YuFu. I'm curious about this tilt functionality, and how good the palm rejection will be. Jon First of I want to say that your product is great and I pledged for it. But like others I am disappointed that the shipping of Nota is being delayed. It feels that your efforts to bring Nota to us early is being diverted as this is 3rd product KS launch since Nota. The delivery of Nota is already delayed to february and probably longer as you have not responded to this question before. The only time you were posting updates at Nota was to promote your other KS launch- sketch dock and even you stopped responding to the comments also- your last response was on Oct 19. I am afraid that this going to repeat same with this project also. Can you clarify? Thanks I should say... if the "polished nickel" looks anything like the black nickel ( <url>
