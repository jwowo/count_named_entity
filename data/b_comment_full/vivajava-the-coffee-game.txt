Hi Chris, Any update? It's been another 2 weeks. - Paul Hello to anyone still reading these comments - Hopefully it's Chris, It's been many weeks with NO update about this situation. Please respond !!!! An update...any update would be appreciated...rather than just sitting and waiting. If the Brewples will never get done, I can understand that, and if that's the case, please refund the $18. If Cherilyn thinks she wants to complete them, I can wait if I know they are WIP. - Paul Hey thanks. Good to know. I'm really hoping to bring them to PAX East to show to my friends. Hello again. Looks like Paul and myself are in the same boat. I'm still waiting for the Brewples and Coffee to Go tote bag. Can we get an update on that? Thanks. May we please get an update? Rochelle and I have asked about our missing Brewples and not received any response. Did they get shipped to us? If so, is there any tracking number we could use to find out what happened to them? Thanks. I'm on the same boat as Paul Rubin. May we please get an update on Brewples and tote bags? I see from the comments others have already received their's. Thank you. Status of Brewples shipments? I am still waiting for mine. Thank you so much for shipping the Brewples to my updated-a-little-bit-late address. You guys are seriously the best. Mmmmmm....VivaJava tastes great after Thanksgiving meal! Broke out my copy to play with family over the weekend. It was a hit with everyone! We played two games back to back to late into the night. Thanks again to Dice Hate Me Games for an awesome board-game. Hmmm, other people got their Brewples - now I am looking for mine! OK, say it and it happens. My Brewples are arrived and much admired. <url>"6 or more" that aren't party games or hideous psychological experiments (read: Werewolf). Still waiting for the Brewples. Any word on when they are due? Received the game and other rewards last week (Canada). Looking forward to breaking VivaJava out at one of our game nights. Thanks guys!!! Have the Brewples gone out to backers yet? Received the game last week, and my "Coffee To Go" arrived today (Belgium) :) Are the Brewples being sent separately from the "Coffee To Go" ? Got the game last week, haven't played it yet :( Looks amazing! Can't wait to play! Just finished punching everything out and I sleeved the big cards but does anyone know what kind of sleeves to buy for the small cards? Germany received the game ;-) had to pay tax at the customs, but everything fine. VivaJava found my home here in the Netherlands yesterday.... looking forward to playing it! Anyone in U.K. got their copy yet? I have not ;( Er, sorry, the second list there is for Flavor Cards. For Featured Blend cards I received: One each of +1rp Regular, +1pp Regular, +2rp Decaf and +2pp Decaf Two each of +1pp Half-Caf, +1pp Decaf, +2rp Half-Caf, and +2pp Half-Caf For Featured Blends I received at least one of each of the 14 kinds shown in rulebook. The kinds I got two of were Re-Do, Indigenous Find, and +1pp (the card that is slid underneath a Blend Slate). Sorry I couldn't take a picture, no camera on me at the moment. Got my copy yesterday, in the wilds of central BC, Canada. Beautiful, beautiful production. Really quite amazing graphic design, and very generous with the components. I'm looking forward to demoing it at my store soon -- and hopefully seeing it available from my distributors soon, too! Well done, folks. I know the game isn't a dud, but it'd be worth it just for the way it looks. Simply beautiful. Thank you. Got my copy in the mail today my group has already played it several times. Wonderful game with the best components I've seen in a while! Noticed something though, I received 17 Flavor Cards and 12 Featured Blend cards. Never too much of a good thing, but the rulebook has those numbers listed at 16 and 8, respectively. Was this deliberate? Thanks so much. I am in Maryland and still ahve not received my copy. I used the website to request help to no avail, and have also commented on BGG, and now sent a Geekmail. I did get my CtG (very nice) and brewple order, thanks. This is not the first project that Gamesalute failed to send shipping notices for. They really should be held accountable for that oversight. When will I receive my copy? I cant wait anymore. I live in Asia. How long would that delay??? My game arrived Friday here in Washington. I couldn't believe how thick the cardboard pieces were, it was really nice. Although it was kind of hard to fit all those goodies back into the box. I was lucky enough to get to play it twice with 2 different sets of friends on Saturday (6 and 7 players). 7 was definitely better because you could have a lot more fun trying to create/sabotage teams. Both games ended from the running out of blend slates. I wish it was just a little bit longer so I had time to blend an extra cup or two (because it's so fun trying to create one) so I may add a few extra slates from the expansion next time. I also looking forward to trying to an 8 player game. TL;DNR? This game is awesome and the 11 others I've played with agree. My copy arrived today with the expansion and complimentary Brewple. I also ordered the COFFEE TO GO & BREWPLE set of 8. I assume from reading a previous comment that those will arrive separately? I hope so. Anyhoo, I'm already had plans for gaming on Sunday so I'll definitely bring it to that party to break it in! My copy has arrived at my package handling department(read: stable address) in PA. Now to get it from there to MD.... Arrived today, cant wait to try it out :) I got my mug and bag, looking forward to getting the game now! Received my copy today and it looks great! Thanks guys :) What is going on with this?? Why no update?? Is there any way to upgrade my shipping to 2 day if there is a chance that I can get my copy before the 1st weekend of October? We have a large gaming weekend that I wanted to debut this game at then. Thanks for the quick response! Very excited for the game, let's get that ship some sails! :D I'm hoping to get some non gamers into the game based on the theme. Who doesn't like coffee?! With an original August release date only a month away, and a month since the last update. How are things coming along? :) Any update on beans and bags and how things are coming along? Why don't you have this game listed on BoardGameGeek.com yet? There is not listing in the database for it. This strikes me as odd. Any word on this been almost a month since the last update? For those of us overseas, could you please make sure the correct game value is listed on the package and not the total including postage as some of us will likely get custom duty or VAT (say 20% in U.K.) slapped on it and hate to pay that for the postage as well! So for my 2-pack International medium roast, please state total value of 2 games and not include the postage bit., Cheers So glad this was incredibly successful. Can't wait to play it. Congratulation! This game looks so sick! I just wish it was out now. It's so hard to find good games to play with 6 people, let alone 8! Good job, guys. Congrats! Congrats!! Poor Cherilyn, somewhere around 741 "Brewple" to be hand colored... Congratz!! Cannot wait for game :-) Congrats! Congrats on your magnificent project! Congratulations! Can't wait to get this game :) I got the money just in time to include the coffee to go pack added to my order! Now I just have wait for the game to brew... Congrats. Looking forwards to the middle of the year in August when the game makes its commercial debut :) Congrats on an amazing game and kickstarter run to do it justice!! So stoked!! Congratulations guys, you pretty much quadrupled your goal! Great job, and I'm really looking forward to playing this unique game! I am going to hold you to that Chris...we want CANS! Congratulations Chris and Cherilyn this is the way to run a really great campaign. TMG could learn A LOT from you and they way you treat your backers. I wasn't sure if I was going to back this as it didn't thrill me at first and like Doug I am not sure how often it will make it but I love your games and decided to throw some money at it. I really can't wait until that fishing game...are we going to have to wait till fall for Take the Bait? And just to be sure if we want the full set of Brewples we just add $18 to our pledge and note that on the survey right? Okay Chris....we have done so well...what is it going to take to get a VivaJava coffee can included? Come on, you know how cool that would be. Call Folgers and we would all chip in a few bucks to make that happen. Is it too late to lobby for a brewple with red hair? LOL A big congrats to Dice Hate Me Games. This project is a shining example of how one should approach and manage a Kickstarter campaign from start to finish. Plus, just when I think this project couldn't possibly go up any higher, I am pleasantly surprised by a new funding level being reached. Looking forward to seeing the final product and getting this great game on my gaming table! Congrats! I Pledge INTERNATIONAL LIGHT ROAST $ 80 plus BREWPLES SET $ 23. Expect the game.Please edit the PDF which can be translated into rules for Japanese. Looking really good, TC, Chris & Cherilyn. Here's hoping for $60K! Dice Hate Me: Better get that home page updated, people looking for the frist time today will not know about some of the great bonuses. Kareem - it just moved into 8th place, you can see the entire list here: <url>"Need new Stretch Goal!" "Need new Stretch Goal!" "Need new Stretch Goal!" :o) So excited about the success of this project. Achievement Unlocked! Wow, we just flew to the $40K stretch goal ridiculously quickly! Congrats on a super-successful Kickstarter campaign. I'm excited to see what else is in store for this game and this company. Way to go, everyone! FINE! ... Twist my arm. Put a gun to my head. Threaten my family. I'll bump it to $40,000. I really need to have less coffee in the mornings.... Kipton, pretty sure it'll be keep your existing international with shot, add 18$ to the amount and then let them know in the survey at the end of the drive that the extra 18 was for the brewples. At least that's usually how it's done. not sure how to adjust my pledge to reflect my desire to add the Brewpie collection in addition to my earlier International light roast with a shot pledge. Please advise. Looks like we'll hit 40k at the least.... Woot woot Great Job on the design work! I hope I can get the same response to my game THE TEXAN WARS soon coming to KickStarter! Of course, if they did allow this, and everyone paid the extra fee, then we'd be well above the $40,000. ;) I'd pay a little extra ($5 to $10) to be able to pick my Brewple, but it probably won't happen. You can see that I inquired about it before. Or can we pick our brewple for an extra $5? I too would prefer the bowtie guy. Can there be a Brewple add on for pledges? As in for every 25 dollars you add get all 8 brewples with your pledge... or something like that. I want them all! Finally have the money to back this. Wish it were a little cheaper for shipping to canada but I'm glad to be able to support this one. Hi guys! I just backed at the $60 + $20 for the tote and mug. I can't wait for the release. I posted a question/suggestion on BGG and didn't want to be redundant so here it is: <url>#8550721 Thanks for creating a really interesting game! Didn't we just hit 35K yesterday, and we're already at 36.6 with 8 days left, the ending soon surge to come, and 2 pictures on the home page of BGG? What comes after 40K? As if I wasn't addicted to coffee and gaming enough as it is... And a NC company right up the road to boot! Thanks for all the hard work you've obviously put into this project! I understand. I'll just keep my fingers crossed for the bowtie dude! I wish you luck Cherilyn. Breaking 35k was the first time I felt bad about achieving a milestone. lol. Thanks for making this game that much more awesome, though!! Almost 600? I predict a late surge and she'll have to do 1,000 at least. If I only just have enough right now (on the 29th) to pledge the $60 for the game, can I paypal you the money a few weeks later the extra $20 for the coffee to go? Great design, great artwork ! Also, could we specify our Brewple? I really want the dude in the button up with the green bowtie. :) I *really* want to have this break the $40k mark. Extra game pieces/features FTW! I've pushed this into Brewple territory. Let's hit $40k. Gave a thumbs up to everything VivaJava-related I could find on BGG! I really want to see what the 40k stretch goal is, then surpass it! Any chance of getting some more pictures posted on BGG that we can thumb up to the front page? Would be good to get a new influx of backers and push it up over that $40k for sure. :) Thanks for the rules! Now why must August be so far away? What would the shipping to Canada be for THE BREWMASTER level, $20? Done. Kept my existing LEVEL, but upped the dollars by $55 to include and additional copy. Thanks! I wondered about pledging multiple times, but other than pledging once and just upping my dollar amount accordingly, I did not know it was possible. Is it, or did you mean two KS accounts? Is that possible? Thanks! Possibility for a three- (or four-) copy pledge level? Figured shipping would be cost-prohibitive, but thought I would ask. I woul definitively up my pledge. Jason Thanks for the prompt reply! Maybe a silly question, but does THE BREWMASTER level include the Geekspansion? another milestone! way to go t.c., chris, cherilyn and all the backers! BOOM! There's your $1, Brandon. Anyone got a dollar? The game cast was great! Gave a really good feel for the game. Super excited! I watched the live gamecast, too... It was surprisingly entertaining, I was only going to pop-in to get a sense of the game, and ended up watching the whole last hour! Thanks for the live gamecast, it was great to see the game in action! Any chance for a Dicetower or other "walkthrough" preview? I've already backed obviously, but I'm wondering if this would be a good game for some of my family not living in the area. They are new gamers that play things like Wasabi and Ticket to Ride etc... I don't know if you remember me Chris, but we met briefly out front of casbah. This is awesome and I'm happy to help another triangle gamer get their game made! Cant wait to get my copy! Love the Lord of the Beans card! Congrats guys Real excited this will be on my doorstep this summer. Wow , intelligent,talented,creative,and handsome...what other attributes are you hiding under th coffee can Congrats on reaching your funding goal! Looks like my funding put you over the top....Congratulations! Looks like a great game. This is my first Kickstart! I've been waiting around for a long time for a project to back... I love the idea of the gameplay, its artistic style, and the solid reputation of those developing it. Best wishes on the endeavor! I wish I could pledge more, but here is my contribution to you guys. Nice work! Will the rules be posted at any point during the Kickstarter campaign? This project will probably become an over 100% project. I think thats great that a game like this is comming to life 50% Funded! Excellent! reach the first hundred, good luck to you all ! I remember playing this game almost a year ago today. It was one of those games that sticks in your mind. One of those games you always want to play. It's great to know that a publisher has come along to support this unique game. I applaud Dice Hate Me Games for realizing the potential, and I raise my cup to TC for designing one great game! waiting for a solitaire version so we can become 'masterblenders!' best of luck with this venture, tc!!!! Best of luck on this venture! Love you guys...to itsy-bitsy pieces! Looking forward to this game! Good luck Dice Hate Me. what i want to know is how i can get the white regular coffee cup that is in the video preview with the "Dice Hate me Games" logo on it? :) Can't wait play this game while sipping a cappuccino or espresso. I'm also strangely looking forward to an accidental spill of some coffee on the game. I'm very excited about this game! How bout the Chocolate expansion. The Ladies would love it! Coffee and chocolate a guaranteed success! Lets get this funded. VivaJava, drink it up! This game is fantastic! Can't wait! Great Video as always! The Geek All Stars Podcast 100% supports this game! Come one come all and back it now! Awesome. I've waited over a year. I can finally own a copy of this Awesome game. That's Awesome!* *Awesome used without permission. This is the first project I've ever Kickstarted. I love coffee and your podcast, so it just seemed right. Dice Hate Me Games you got a fanboy! Love it! I want my caffeine please !!!! How could I resist adding $20 to my pledge when I get a delightful tumbler and tote? Gotta love totes and tumblers.... Love the video. That boy leaves coffee cups all over the place! Thanks for the product placement, BTW. :-)
