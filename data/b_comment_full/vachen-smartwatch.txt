one of the first projects I backed - and the first of several that never delivered - so I guess my first KS fraud. Oh well - KS got their money just an FYI - Karma is a real **** the 110K you stole probably didn't last a long time Does anyone have Won's information.. I will gladly take him to small claims court.. I just need an address.. Super easy to get our money back with the court system... Anyone find out his address as we have is full name Won Ree.... It's a YEAR later, and I just thought I'd check-in and see if anything had changed here. Nope, Won Rhee is still a thief, he has our money, and we have nothing. F U , @ Won ! 🆂🅷🅸🆃🅷🅾🆄🆂🅴 Just thought I'd check in and see if anything has changed here. Nope, Won Rhee is still a thief, he has our money, and we have nothing. F U , @ Won ! @Won I do not forget you... @Won You are a disgrace. Just thought I'd post this again, since clearly nothing has changed... Just thought I'd check in and see if anything has changed here. Nope, Won Rhee is still a thief, he has our money, and we have nothing. Thanks, Ron! Still nothing on this outdated tech now, right? Just thought I'd check in and see if anything has changed here. Nope, Won Rhee is still a thief, he has our money, and we have nothing. Thanks, Ron! I don't know if I want to kickstart anything, I have helped five fails, almost Two Grand of money I could have bought something better Haven't logged into kickstarter in ages. Just saw this and I'm assuming these people essentially stole our money, right? He logged in on Jan 11 2017 and apparently couldn't be bothered to tell us anything... Still nothing : / , How do we know if he is even alive or not, we haven't even seen an update or a day that he has logged in for some time now It's sad that the authorities and state don't care wone someone steals 110,128 K from individuals. If someone robbed the bank with this amount the authorities would be all over this. This is as much a failure of our government and state protection agencies as anything. We are rewarding the crooks by doing nothing. And all in the interests of making some Kickstarter executives rich while we turn a blind eye to the theft that regularly goes on via this criminal enablement vehicle called Kickstarter. Just for fun, let's all bombard Ron's YouTube channel with our "frank" comments. <url>~fin Oh bay bee can't do this to me baby Just gotta get out just gotta get write outta here ...

Trogdor Hi Won, Did you realize you are so late on delivery that even Apple, the late mover pn markets has announced a watch today .... So are you still planning to deliver something? Do tell us your progress. Our imperious project creator has logged in today. Perhaps he was hoping we'd forgotten about this project... @Trogdor: Some traditional methods of assertion may cost less... Like ensuring that his professional associates and/or (current/potential)Employer/or IRS/... are aware of his lack of ethics and illegal behavior. @fmotta - finding him is trivial. I've done it. The $ involved are not worth the possible actions. Hunting down this guy is looking far more interesting a prospect now that he has defrauded and departed. @Paul In hindsight, 110k ain't shit in terms of making a watch -- particularly an electronic watch. Hell there are watch projects that reached near or past 1 mil...and they've struggled. Having said that -- I agree with all you say except fraud. [x] Piss poor communication [x] Piss poor project management [x] Karma is a **** [ ] Fraud Looking for funding??? WTF - thats what 110,000+ from us kickstarters was suppose to provide. While not an attorney I believe there is fraud - in return for us funding his project - he pledged/promised us stuff - so far NOTHING - and his last update 2013!! - that to me smells of fraud - and while it the grand scheme of life 169$ isnt much - its the thought - KARMA is a **** and Won or whoever you are - Karma will find you - @Avinish Won has said he's looking for funding. Apparently someone below got hold of Won or someone...and they were told funding was looking like it may happen. . Won hasn't logged into this project since mid-December 2014. He may be reading things without logging in. . Won hasn't responded to my PM's... . IMHO - consider the money gone. I don't see fraud here but I do see poor communication and project management. So, basically we're out of our money we threw into this project, right? I may change that phrase and call it being "Won Ree'd" - the sole evident beneficiary of this KS "project". F-ing loser! I have coined a new phrase... "Being Vachened". having your KS funds wander into a black hole from whence nothing comes. It is sort of being screwed except you don't walk funny nor bleed afterward. @Joseph, Thanks! Can't wait to see his update, if ever @Joseph Thank you for the update. I'm not holding my breath though... holy shit, i actually got to speak to him, so i guess I will post an "update" on behalf of him, so he says, funding is ALMOST there within the next few months. well that is that... we are screwed. if anyone is paying attention to the whois. it all changed name from won to this guy in south korea.

Is there someone that can visit him..?�� Won, are you out there? are you seeing this? I am still a supporter, and hope the watch can be made, but I am not getting any support from you...please tell us something, anything I have no idea how anyone with even the smallest portion of integrity can let this 'project' die without an explanation. Won Rhee - you have no idea of what ethics are and are bordering on sociopathic behavior. It is looing like it is time to get the IRS involved and get your bank accounts and home and vehicle locked up in the mire of the US Gov't. Do you want to have to live under a bridge and walk to the road and beg for money for your next cheese burger? This has happened before many times - maybe You can be the next one on the long list. As of today, I am pursuing a chargeback. I expect to get burned, given how much time has elapsed since the project was "successfully funded," but hopefully something will come of it. Mostly I'm just disappointed at the level of communication on this from Mr. Won Rhee; I might still be out the money, but the least he could do is be honest and explain the situation. I'm upset that there's so little to be done on this, as saying "I'll never back another project by Won Rhee, again!" seems...pointless and unsatisfying, as an ending. @etchD: That is because I opened a case through two government agencies against Won. I am searching for one that will use our tax dollars and pursue recompense/refunds before someone takes this to a physical level and visits Won at home/work with a Strong assertion for a solution. Wouldn't his employer be upset if a number of people frequently visited him at his place of employment and asked to see him or worse. @Paul Good luck on the chargeback! Let us know how it works our. It's a roll of the dice this late in the game but it is worth a shot. At least you can say you tried :) Hey Trogdor, the reason in me sees complete logic in what you have written. I guess it’s the hope of receiving such a great product but the realisation now that the reality is very different. Thanks for the advice I’m talking to the credit card company now regarding a chargeback.

Lucky you! @Paul Kickstarter will do nothing to aid you, Period. Your best bet is to contact customer service for whatever payment method you used and pursue a chargeback. My gut feeling is that Won burned through all the funding and then some. He's said as much and that he's looking for more funding. For good or bad I don't see fraud here. Mismanagement, bumbling and incompetence are probably at blame here. Given more experience with Kickstarter I'd also say he sat the funding level far too low -- in fact he barely met his funding level. Bottom line: There is likely no money for Won to refund. My issue with Won right now is that he either has an unrealistic hope that he'll get more funding and/or he lacks the balls to stand up and update us and say that the project is over. Hello other frustrated VACHEN victims, I'm in Australia and I'm not sure what rights are available to me. How can Kickstarter condone this type of fraudulent behaviour? With promise after promise of the watch being almost ready we are all still waiting. I feel that this whole project was a scam and nothing more. If this type of practice can occur what is to say that anyone can promise the creation and delivery of ‘nothing’ and for ‘nothing’ you can kickstart me from a range of $50 to $5000. One very angry and frustrated kickstart backer! Mr Won Rhee please refund me the $188 I paid you!

Seems the Attorney General of California wants use to find a resolution. How about this? Give me my money back and we're good. That works for me! After pursuit through a government agency I received a hand-written response from Won. My interpretation of the response is that he is still working on this project. Yet, it appears that since we cannot do anything to him we do not deserve a few minutes to post an update here. Maybe we need another government agency to pursue him. Maybe the IRS next? well, i bought myself the moto 360, and it is fantastic, and i know i'll never recieve this watch, got the same letter in the mail hand written saying when funding happens he will get the watch to us, no one is going to bite on this, not with android wear out now, this was a new and great idea, could have got in the market early, but was left in the dust when google put out their own OS. that is that. my money is gone, it sucks, but it happens. first time i got kickstarter burned. I just want a watch honestly...I saw this project and thought it would be cool. but now I'm on the fence if this will actually be done or not...I am still mostly hopeful about it, but as more time goes by with silence and no responses to issues it scares me... What if we are no in Cali . Can we still file ? ((( don't know if this was asked before )) and if we can not do we still get our money if it goes through ? Thank you Please can I have a refund. @Won ~16% of backers requesting at least a watch now want a refund. An update regarding your future plans [waiting for funding is not a 'plan'] is expected. Pro-active options for backers include complaints to California AG, attempting charge backs and attempting to reason with the creator.

If anything happens as a result, it will be far more painful for Ron than just one person getting their $259 back. be proactive. wade did the right thing....he contacted the credit card company. putting your name on a list isn't going to do anything.

So perhaps reposting it with additional names will have the same effect on others. There is strength in numbers! Filed a dispute with my credit card company. Got this today: We are pleased to let you know that the temporary credit we posted to your account for 169.00 on 8/25/2014 is now permanent. Won - keep your watch. It will never tick in my house... @Tucker Snedeker on September 28 "I also submitted a complaint to the California state's attorney and recently gotten a hand written letter back from Vachen suggesting they were still working on the project and requesting more time." I got the same hand written letter as you did. We all seem to be going in circles with no resolution. I don't have an answer, Kickstarter has no answer, and Won Rhee is seemingly avoiding everything. @Avinish Reposting the list will probably will have the same effect as your comment. :P You all do realize that your reposting list isn't going to go any where, right.

I also submitted a complaint to the California state's attorney and recently gotten a hand written letter back from Vachen suggesting they were still working on the project and requesting more time. I find this unlikely Won and team have failed to posed an update in 9 months. The fact that they would forward me a hand written letter from Vachen asking for more time is laughable. I encourage everyone who hasn't heard from Won to file a complaint like I did. If they get enough perhaps the California authorities will take action. Won, you can't ignore the group on Kickstarter and then ask of for more time via the California State's attorney. We won't go away. I will be filing another complaint if my watch or my refund doesn;t show up in the next month or two.

Trogdor I backed this project with the hopes of getting a color smart watch that was different from everyone else's smart watch. I don't like having the same thing as everyone else. I want the watch, I don't want the money...tell me what is going on with the watch already. Appears KS has changed TOS: @Won -- please read. Kickstarter provides a funding platform for creative projects. When a creator posts a project on Kickstarter, they’re inviting other people to form a contract with them. Anyone who backs a project is accepting the creator’s offer, and forming that contract. Kickstarter is not a part of this contract — the contract is a direct legal agreement between creators and their backers. Here are the terms that govern that agreement: When a project is successfully funded, the creator must complete the project and fulfill each reward. Once a creator has done so, they’ve satisfied their obligation to their backers. Throughout the process, creators owe their backers a high standard of effort, honest communication, and a dedication to bringing the project to life. At the same time, backers must understand that when they back a project, they’re helping to create something new — not ordering something that already exists. There may be changes or delays, and there’s a chance something could happen that prevents the creator from being able to finish the project as promised. If a creator is unable to complete their project and fulfill rewards, they’ve failed to live up to the basic obligations of this agreement. To right this, they must make every reasonable effort to find another way of bringing the project to the best possible conclusion for backers. A creator in this position has only remedied the situation and met their obligations to backers if: they post an update that explains what work has been done, how funds were used, and what prevents them from finishing the project as planned; they work diligently and in good faith to bring the project to the best possible conclusion in a timeframe that’s communicated to backers; they’re able to demonstrate that they’ve used funds appropriately and made every reasonable effort to complete the project as promised; they’ve been honest, and have made no material misrepresentations in their communication to backers; and they offer to return any remaining funds to backers who have not received their reward (in proportion to the amounts pledged), or else explain how those funds will be used to complete the project in some alternate form. The creator is solely responsible for fulfilling the promises made in their project. If they’re unable to satisfy the terms of this agreement, they may be subject to legal action by backers. can ANYONE here check this out?

Mr. Won Rhee just hasn't told anyone, including himself. Here is some info sent to the company on July 2, 2014: "applicant’s mark VACHEN is highly similar to the registered mark VACON in sound, appearance and commercial impression. The only differences between the marks are the silent letter “H” in the middle of applicant’s mark and the phonetically-equivalent letters “E” and “O” in the marks. However, minor changes in words (e.g. phonetic substitution) are insufficient alone to distinguish marks. Therefore, these minor differences do not alter the commercial impressions of the marks sufficiently to obviate the likelihood of confusion."

Trogdor Mr. Rhee, I have asked numerous times politely for a response and or a refund. Unlike the others that have been posting I am not bothering with legal action. You either send me my money back or I will find you. You are a thief and I only know one way to deal with the likes of you............. @Tom Even though it is a requirement that he do so if he cannot ship the rewards, I wouldn't be at all surprised if you are right. Having said that -- I expect an update stating 'what is'. The request for a refund is as much a vote of no confidence as it is a formality. Folks, I doubt he even has the $ anymore to refund anyone.

Trogdor <url>"hey, production issues" or "can't get fcc approval right now" just something, because the worst thing to do is ignore your customers. Is a creator legally obligated to fulfill the promises of their project? Yes. Kickstarter's Terms of Use require creators to fulfill all rewards of their project or refund any backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill. (This is what creators see before they launch.) This information can serve as a basis for legal recourse if a creator doesn't fulfill their promises. We hope that backers will consider using this provision only in cases where they feel that a creator has not made a good faith effort to complete the project and fulfill. I've asked before with no response, but has *anyone* received a refund? INFO FOR CALIFORNIA AG COMPLAINT FORM: YOU CAN GET AND PASTE AS NEEDED.

INFO ON COMPANY VACHEN USA 2901 EMBLETON LN SAN RAMON, CA 94582 EMAIL: <email> FRUSTRATED BACKERS START FILING COMPLAINT IN STATE OF CALIFORNIA AG WEBSITE. HERE IS INFO TO HELP FIGHT OUR BATTLE. FIRST COMPLAINT LINK: <url>"backers" remember when i wrote a nice long ass comment to Won about business and refunds? And you replied with your crappy non sense as if you knew what "business" is about? Wrote back about people nagging and be patient? You pretended to know what "investements" are about and you know... other crap you said.. Well i dont have much to say but all i'm gonna say is... shove it :). Months ago you never believed it. Well now you have your answer. Simply, shove it. If you want your money back you can work extra hours in your office, wash cars on your spare time, baby sit, strip or you could just beg. OR!! Slap raccoons and pigeons and post the video on YouTube and see how many hits you get and make money off that... oh and hope you don't get in trouble for actually slapping those animals. Lucky for me i accepted the fact that this is not happening almost a year ago. Thanks to those who backed me up before. And apologies to all for the "shove it" part but i just love this moment. You should have listened to me :P. Won, sometimes we win, n sometimes we eat... you get the message. I hope things work out for you and the backers. <url>"If you paid for the watch, you should get the watch". Perhaps if others did the same, we would have additional leverage against Won to have him issue refunds. The watch ain't coming folks. Won, i am one of the backer for Pledge $279 or more. It means watch movement and case. I am not expecting ship any case to me, if you only can produce the movement, maybe just ship the movement to me and close the project. Smart waerable is hot and should not be too difficult to sell yourself to other company. maybe someday i can buy the case from another company which you will work for. Good luck. Won, It seems to me that you are ignoring the truth. In my opinion none of your backers is willing to continue any support for your company or your product. Stop ignoring that fact and give us our refund! If anybody believes his last post or still supports this thief then you are stupid, he has taken our money, if he ever delivers this product it will be so out of date it should be put in a museum, I have asked for a refund several times and he has just ignored all requests, just a common thief Refunds at this point would be a welcomed surprise. It seems at this point we've funded a well meaning attempt of someone(Won) who is in over there head. The fancy video and "working prototypes" had me fooled. Won, Take the hit to your pride and kill the project. Walk away with the lesson learned. To help restore any faith in any future project that you'll ever be attached to, refund everyone's money. Won, lack of funding? You might as well kill the project while you can! You are setting yourself up for more failures. Look what is going on around you. Apple, LG and Moto are already ramping up production and out to market next quarter. While you go out and beg for partners (money). You really need to get a sense of reality. Quit while your ahead and don't produce anything except REFUNDS. What Won told us with his latest update is, that he and / or his friends are not able to calclate a project. I feel fooled when a businessman tells me, he THINKS there is enough for money for this or that. He has know his costs as well as his profits. IMHO the project is dead and our money lost. I've been patient and trying to understand what is going on. I think it's too little too late. Sadly, I'm gun shy of investing in any other kick starter project. @Vernon Although your spirit is admirable, I am not willing to throw more money into this. I've picked up the LG G-Watch and, having used it for a day now, in my opinion, the Vachen watch is now far outdated [Bluetooth 2.1, Gingerbread, for a start...] -=- Won - I've supported you in the past. At this point, if you're giving refunds, I want one. This project needs to have a drop dead ending point regardless of the money involved. With a letter of Credit, the money is held by a bank and the only way that Won or the manufacture get paid is by meeting the the criteria setup in the Letter of Credit. What I am suggesting is that a group from the backers meet (conference call) with Won , understand where he is, what needs to be done, etc. The group would report back to the backers on what they feel is the timeline and cost to finish the product. If you realize that you can not go back ( get your investment back) we need to move forward. More than 1 year later you told us you have not enough money? 100,000 you set for goal and even right now you still have more than that. If follow schedule we should got our watch in more than half year before. So what you want the backer saying? My dear we will give you more money, how much you want? Bullshit ! If you cannot complete your project please refund ASAP. At the end of one the years you tell us that you have enough bottom for the project, it really is to take people for cons.vous are that an escrot... Well, yes the project cannot be born I ask you for the refund(repayment) in a row!!!! Refund looser now....!!!!!! @vernon are you suggesting that the current backers should stump up more money now to try to bail out the project?? The only way that people are going to see anything from this project is if Won somehow gets the funding and the watches miraculously appear; or if somehow people can tie Kickstarter in as being liable for the project failure (which isn't going to happen); or if you can get your money back from the credit card company. The project is dead and the money is gone - Won couldn't give a refund even if he wanted to. MY idea is that is we split up the added cost by the backers and put the money into a Letters of credit. that can only be hit once the product ships. That way if the backers want to get your whole money back ( selling the watch on eBay) at least we have a completed product. The Letters of credit would give Won the backing to get a manufacture but neither of them gets any money until the product is shipped /received. Otherwise you will get nothing Amy other suggestions or comments How much more do you need? Dear Won, Thanks fot he update, but i think most backers do not have the patience anymore, but because we are bound to you as you do not refund us our money. So i would REALLY want you to REFUND my money......and all others backers that want their money back. As i can read you are waiting untill your have a new funder to produce the watch. That can take years as there are now many smartwatches on the market.. I am still hoping (actually demanding) to get my money back asap. dead project ... no news, no response, no reward I have been a stout believer that Won was going to come through with this product, but the lack of any information for the last couple of months is kind of odd, and I am not liking it as of right now. Is there some kind of health issue? Some kind of production snag? Anything that you can tell us about the upcoming production at all? I am seriously concerned. I put money into projects that I feel that are going to actually be beneficial to me, with the intention of them being completed, and with them being open with communication. Please let us know something that is going on Just sent this email to Won: Won, I would like a refund ($169). I have waited as others have patiently for news, any news. You have left everyone angry now. I had hopes. All backers had hopes. Do the right thing - close the project and refund people's money. Give up. The watch is dead. I give up. This project funded 13 month ago and the lag of information and updates is just disappointing. This is by far the worst kickstarter I was ever involved in. And besides that I´m just no longer interested in this project or this product and I´m no longer interested in supporting a company with that kind of course of business. Even if there isn´t a big chance, I say it anyway: I request a refund. Already filed a claim to my credit company. This project has gone too long without update and doesn't look like it will ever get done in time. The Moto 360 surpasses this device in every aspect and I will be moving on once I get my refund kickstarter "Thanks for writing in. I’m sorry to hear that the creator has not done a better job of communicating. We've reached out to them multiple times with a reminder of their obligations to their backer community, in addition to having forwarded along concerns from your fellow backers. While we're disheartened that they have not yet updated you and other backers on the status of their project, we're unable to force them to do so. Here at Kickstarter HQ, we expect creators to fulfill rewards, offer refunds if they’re unable to complete their project, and communicate with backers at every step along the way. While Kickstarter is the platform for this agreement, we are not a part of it. We do not investigate a project creator’s ability to complete their project, nor do we facilitate refunds or the fulfillment of rewards. While in most cases you’ll find that rewards are delivered as promised, it’s also important to realize that some projects might not fulfill as planned. When you back a project on Kickstarter you enter into an agreement with the project creator, as described in our Terms of Use: <url>’t hesitate to let us know if you have any other questions." @Won you said the survey would come the end of June or you would update us ASAP. Please confirm your intent to meet the schedule you stated. OK ... if I do not receive a refund no later than July 1, 2014 .. I go to court for fraud. if you need to create a class action lawsuit. Won. you have managed to make many supporters upset by lack of communication. Furthermore, the delays you have incurred have allowed Apple, LG and Samsung all bypass you and your product. Honestly, I suggest #1 refund all the backers their money or #2 you could be looking at a class action lawsuit against your company. Just a few thoughts on my mind. asked for a refund a while ago...no news yet....VERY bad for busines Left several messages with this idiot about a refund and he has totally ignored every single one, nothing but a thief survey coming per the last comment on here Won? The end of Jun is coming, any updates? Wow - nearly a year late, and it's been over six months since there was even an update. Honestly, I would love to see once a month updates, something that says that where the production is, even if it says "Dude, we got nothing this month as we don't have the Chinese factory tooled properly yet." Also, they still have to go through FCC certification, which takes a couple of weeks or months, I don't remember right now. So just because they get to manufacturing, doesn't mean it will be available to us too soon. Can anyone confirm receiving a refund? Mr. Rhee, I would like a refund. You apparently cannot deliver the watch at all, let alone one that fulfills the initial description of working with iPhone. Do the right thing and people might possibly consider backing you on your next project. I would like a refund. Please confirm when you have done so. One day we'll get a watch if we all believe... Monthly updates would be nice or bi-weekly, just something to let the backers know anything. Other projects are more forthcoming with updates which leads to confidence even if the project is behind schedule. I hope the one $5,000 backer at least got to visit Korea. Refund has been requested as well via messaging too. It appears that it's time to file a claim against the credit card charge for this project. What I would like to know is of all the people that have/had an iphone when they backed this project, if they didn't read/realize that it was going to be using the android os gingerbread....that should alone have given you an idea that it would not be comparable...you people are complaining that you didn't get it when promised...I get it, I wanted this for the holiday season as a gift to myself, it sucks that I didn't have a good watch to show off over the holiday with people...but that happens when you have a new business. I have been one of the more defensive of the company, as I understand doing business with different Chinese factories, and the fact that they promise on things they can not deliver which jams up the rest of us. You blame Won Rhee, I blame the fact that he sent the whole project overseas and tried to do it cheaper there then doing it here in the U.S. @Lafriks Of course there is a risk for failure. However folks may ask for refunds. -=- Is a creator legally obligated to fulfill the promises of their project? Yes. Kickstarter's Terms of Use require creators to fulfill all rewards of their project or refund any backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill. (This is what creators see before they launch.) This information can serve as a basis for legal recourse if a creator doesn't fulfill their promises. We hope that backers will consider using this provision only in cases where they feel that a creator has not made a good faith effort to complete the project and fulfill. This is beyond absurd. We have been waiting for over a year on this Vachen Watch, whereby many more advanced watches have be released and delivered! I would like a refund ASAP. If not, I will make known to the public that this product and company has been nothing more than a kickstarter money scheme. I think that everyone need to understand that this site is not a shop or something like that were you go and buy something. It's kind of investment and as all investments it has a risk of failure so I don't understand what kind of refund everyone wants here. Of course I also really wish that I will finally get my watch sooner or later. And if there would be way to hack it to work with google soon to be released android wearable platform I would be totally happy :) Just asked for a refund. There are other, similar products already on the market, and this technology is outdated (archaic, by computer tech standards). Things will only get worse the longer it takes to deliver. I don't need a fashionable paperweight. I have moved house since I paid for the watch and have e mailed you with my new address but have not had a response/acknowledgment. Would be a great shame if after all this time I fail to receive the finished product! How can I be sure that you will send this to my correct address? Please respond. No iPhone? Please refund ASAP!!!!! okay, one of the other projects I backed do an update every month, I don't expect one every week, but responses would be nice, as would monthly updates Project creators/managers need to inform backers regularly (at least a paragraph a week in an Update - if that is too hard then maybe McD can use another manager/burger fipper). no, it will not work with iphones, it runs gingerbread, which is really old now, it was going to be old tech when it was supposed originally drop. All I know for a fact is it is a color screen, and I think you can change the movement from one face to another...I could be wrong though Just sent my second request for my money back. If this is not going to be compatible with iPhone then it is basically a paperweight to me. After multiple Kickstarter backed projects it sucks that this one and overall experience has been totally BS. I have asked for a refund and he has ignored my request several times yet he has time to post on here, where is my refund?????? It has color....... That's all I got . We are at 1 year later today, we have hope that there will be a watch come middle of August. My question is now, what makes this watch so special now with all the different watches that are out there? also knowing now it will not work with an iPhone has me personally disappointed. Is this watch worth my continued support? I look forward to hearing what makes the Vachen Smart Watch better than the other smart watches that are on the market now? Happy anniversary everyone! 2days to go,celebrate 1 yr anniversary Wonrhee.small Creator WON RHEE on May 16 We have finally made a contract with our mass production partner. We will delivery the Vachen smartwatch on July. We will upload the detail schedule for the survey and delivery sometime next week. Thank you guys for all your support!! Well, it is now going on to two weeks, where is the schedule? I also asked for e refund, but no answer yet......Please respond. Is it true that this will not work with an iPhone? If that is true, has someone been able to get a refund? Thank you. yay!!! i hope i get it 1 year later after the estimated date!! I also asked for e refund, but no answer yet......Please respond. Are there any backers out there still willing to wait to see if this project ever comes to fruition? Everyone has been more than patient with your lack of updates. I would like my refund please as I am sure most other backers do. Last Won login was 6 May. Suggest using the 'Contact Me' link off to the right rather than the forum. That may get seen sooner than any forum comments. @Won you said on 31Mar that you were giving me the refund but up to this moment, I have never received a cent from you. please response! I want to have more faith in this project, since it seemed so cool when it was first proposed, but in the year since it saw funding there have been only the most scattered and minimal updates, and still no tangible signs of real progress. At this point, there are already other wearable smart devices edging into the market, and I've lost a lot of patience and confidence. It would be different if we had been promised a delivery estimate of May or July 2014, which I would have thought was reasonable, anyway, given the nature of the product. However, with delay after delay and very little in the way of response or communication from the creator, I am close to pursuing a refund. To that end, if anyone else has already begun that process and has any advice to share, I would appreciate hearing it, so that I am better prepared in the event that I do decide to go that route. Won, you need to reply to my messages please. we are more then one year later and look at the development.Look at the XS-4 smartwatch...a complete phone with EVERYTHING you could imagine....1000x bette then this watch...this is now outdated. I want a refund. Please post an update soon! We are approaching the first anniversary of no product. I am still excited for a watch that will have a color screen and be more compatable with other phones, unlike the samsung gear. either way backed this project to see a cool design come together. eager to see the production schedule. Whether its obsolete or not ill be happy to get it. At least at some point i have heard back on this project. I got stiffed on another watch project and that creator definitely took off with the money. Won, why are you not responding to my messages? I asked for a refund and you said that you just needed my amazon transaction IDs. I gave those to you immediately and I have not heard back from you in over a month! Another rubbish post,so we have to wait another year for an out of date product,I asked for a refund but did not get it, will take it further That's great news! Yeaaaaaa!!!! Great news! I'm actually still looking forward to using Vachen! Best of luck, Won. nice! can't wait till we get the new schedule. Well that is great news. Please post the production/delivery schedule soon!! Well that is great news. Please post the production/delivery schedule soon!! @Brian If the refund was processed through Amazon and KS processes, those people would be removed from the project and unable to comment. If the refund was handled in any other way, they could still comment. The creator would have to chime in and answer about refunds and methods. He had previously offered to refund - don't know if he actually did this though. -=- @Won Come on buddy - give us the straight dope. You either have more funding or you don't. If people start guessing, nothing good will come of it...do what I know you to do....just say what it is.... At This point I demand a refund. Has anyone who requested one received it yet? WON RHEE San Ramon, CA · Last login Apr 21 2014 Last comment - March 17th.... Hi Enrico, Thanks for following up. We do our best to give project creators the freedom and support necessary to bring their new and exciting ideas to life. This often means that when projects launch on Kickstarter they’re in the early stages of development. While we encourage creators to communicate regularly through this process, it’s important to remember that each of them will approach this differently. In most cases, this may be the first time that a creator has the responsibility of communicating with a large support community. Still, we expect that creators will make every effort to complete their project as promised and keep backers updated along the way. We also hope that backers will remain understanding as everyone learns through this process. I’m happy to reach out to this creator and offer our assistance. My goal is to open the lines of communication and encourage them to update more effectively moving forward. You should also continue reaching out to them on your end as well. Through this joint effort, we’ll be reminding the creator to check in. Thanks for being a thoughtful backer and member of the Kickstarter community. I hope you hear more from the project creator soon. Best, Natalie What a great help from Kickstarter. Hahaha. Kickstarter Support (Kickstarter) Apr 08 19:04 Hi Enrico, Thanks for reaching out and sorry to hear about the frustrating experience you've had with this project. Successfully funded project creators plan their project around the funding they received while it was live on Kickstarter. As a result, these funds are often tied up in the completion of the project, or fulfillment of rewards. That said, if you'd like to see if a refund may be possible, you can reach out to the project creator directly. To message a project creator, simply go to the project page and click on the "Contact me" link under the creator's name in the bio section. Best, Natalie I believe this project has been abandoned. No updates of good or bad news. This was a cool project a year ago but it no longer holds any "coolness" value to me any longer with other watches being introduced. I request a refund. i have open ticket with kickstarter for refund I would really like a refund. No proper update for four months. One comment a month since December. Won logged in today (maybe just to remind himself of when the watch was meant to ship??) but no communication, as usual. I would like to have a update from Mr. Won. If there is no updat within a week i wil also demand a refund. Had no updates for a while now, seems to me that this guy is wasting our time and taken our money Won Rhee I'm peter terry from England I've asked numerous times for a refund with no reply,with this in mind I'm judging your not a honest person shame on you!!!! the facebook page said that pre-orders can be done in April, is that still accurate? also, we need a real posted update, there hasn't been anything on this topic posted really by Won since the 17th, and we haven't gotten a posted update since December. I would like to know what is going on with the watch now please Joshua A Membreno, that is true, it is not iPhone compatible. here is the update about that... <url>"better person you".i wish people use this site as it was intended and not use it as a social media site to comment on peoples comments to the creators to ask justifiable questions and concerns. I is sorry i is so ignant, thank you for pointing out all of my flaws Amro Alsuwaidi...good job being able to read the whole "Be respectful and considerate" link next to the post comment button. @Avinish - i suggest u read my post from a few months ago. I have copied my comment below for reference. If that is not justifiable then I don't know what is. This is in relation to ur comment "grown ups". Oh, I forgot to mention that, if I don't reply to the next comments directed at me and to others who support me (the people asking for refund - in other words, the smart ones), it means I'm wiser, and I won't lower my self down to ur level and watch u beat me with your experience as an ignorant. Good luck to you all with the refunds. I gave up mine, and won't be asking for it again, maybe Vachen needs a lot more support. Good luck Mr Won, I really hope you will keep your promise to deliver the goods wether it's today or a year from now. I believe you have put a lot of effort and time in your product but maybe not on your backers. Finally, I would like to send a message to all the backers out there asking for a refund. If you can find it in your heart to just let it go and give Mr Won another chance, then I think u should respond immediately and forget about the refund request. I know it's not an easy decision, and I know you are angry (u can read my post below and see how i felt), and it wasn't easy for me to just let go and say "u know what... It's ok..". Think twice, think a million times. Believe me I'm not doing this for the watch, because I don't want or need the watch anymore, I'm doing this for my sake, my beliefs I guess. I can't see what Mr Won is doing behind the scenes so I will give him the benefit of the doubt. However I do believe he loves his product as much as we do. So backers, think. And haters... If u have nothing good to say, then just stay quite because nobody is going to listen to you. MY PREVIOUS COMMENT: "Dear Mr Won and the Vachen team. I have so far been very patient with your company . I eagerly funded your kickstarter project with no reservations whatsoever because I liked the product concept you were selling to the world. I , however , did so based on the promise that if funding was successful , the product would be delivered within July . I have since learned a painful lesson on the inability of internet companies to be honest with their customers. All of your customers , as a collective , trusted you hard enough to put their hard earned money into a project that was the brainchild of a reputable brand , such as sony or apple , but one that was pretty much unheard of before the start of this kickstarter campaign. That shows alot of trust . You so far have shown little appreciation for that trust by the fact that you have repeatedly delayed the delivery date of this product. Had you told us from the beginning about the problems you were having with production then many of us would have not invested in your watch. The reason is that many , if not most of us invested in your watch because we wanted to be the first adopters of a real smartwatch that actually works. Many of us were technologically up to date enough to be aware of the fact that your main competitors , Samsung , Sony and Qualcomm were working on similar products that would hit the shelves by fall of 2013. We did not want to wait for such late arrivals and so we subsequently chose to purchase your watch based on the earlier delivery date compared to your competitors . But time and time again you have tried to keep us from raising our voices by teasing us with new projected delivery dates . Lies done in the name of having us hold on for just a little longer. That is not the way to market a product . The moral , and many would argue the smart way to sell a product would be to be completely honest with your customers , not from now , not from a month ago , but from the get go . When all trust is lost , even new promises , ones that are made in all honesty , become very hard to believe. Not wanting to feel ancient amongst my peers by being the only one with a dumbwatch , I have since purchased both the Samsung and the Sony smartwatch 2 and I'm also looking forward to the release date of both the Omate and the Qualcomm releases. Even if , by some miracle of God , your watch were to be delivered to us tomorrow. It would not be given nearly the sort of attention that it would have received had it been released before its competitors . Now , due to its late arrival , it would appear almost as if it was just another SmartWatch clone. At least thats how the market would see it. Theres only one thing you can do to save your reputation now . The right thing would be to reimburse those customers that want their money back so that they could use it to purchase smart watches that actually exist in the marketplace. You have realize that many of us no longer want an outdated watch . Its like you sold us the idea of an old brick phone in the 1990s only it to deliver after the release of the iphone. I am sure some of you out there may disagree with some of the harsh criticism that the seller has received , but ladies and gentleman , this is business administration 101 . Its not rocket science . You dont promises you arent entirely sure you cant keep . Investors are like shareholders , they have a right to know about what is going on in a company that they are essentially part owners of. Theres no doubt that Mr Won is a smart man . He , being a member of the tech industry , is well aware of the fast pace of change and innovation that this sector goes through. What is a groundbreaking product today , becomes prehistoric tomorrow. Oh and last of all to you Mr Won , I , on behalf of other disgruntled customers , apologize for the harsh criticism that we have all given you , but you have made enemies of the the most patient members ." I would really like a refund. Avinish I wasn't one of the last three to ask for a refund. By the way there were four I dont think there is any point on waiting anymore. I would really like a refund. you weren't one of the last three to post up about the refund, were you? Avinish I'm requesting a refund because it's not iPhone compatible if that's not grown up so be it!!!!!!! also, post up an update please... I find it funny that people on some of the other smart watches are not complaining this much about delays and demanding refunds, they are being grown up and being patient. The difference is people are being patient with the other ones, and here they are complaining. Refund please. I would like to request a refund. I done waiting I would like a refund I formally request a refund. No point in repeating what others have expressed. @WON - first, thank you for finally providing details. I think I speak for all of the backers, that communication is the first priority in these projects. We just want to know. Second, I think I also speak for all the backers in that this is a wonderful watch. The best I have seen. I'm a watch collector, as I'm sure many other backers are. This would be a GREAT addition to my collection. Please reach out to people like Vernon, and I'm assuming you're reaching out to other mass production companies (there are many) too. I wish you good luck, and again, updates on a frequent basis - especially at this critical stage - is very, very important. IF you need help, reach out to your backers for help. I have product experience with oversea manufactures and have lots of contact in the electronics industry. I am sure others have that and more. Why not setup a advisory group from the backers to help you. I am in if you decide to go this route. or you can check and see if another manufacture would be able to do it on your terms. @Won The possibility exists: 1] Investors will not provide funds and/or 2] You cannot reach agreement with mass production company, Obviously you cannot negotiate or wait forever. What is the date/time at which you say, "We quit. We will not make this watch."? At some point, given time, it will not be worth creating the watch.... @Peter Terry, one of the KS I am backing is delayed due to manufacturing issues now going on 6 months after they already delayed the timeline once. These things happen, and we just can't control them. You have an obligation to be patient as we are not doing any of the foot work for these projects. We have hopeful dates of when to expect items, but honestly if we don't know what problems they are running into then it is hard for us to say that they are not doing the job properly. I will be the first to say that comments from the developers have been kind of light lately, the H.O.T. watch is coming along, but it is also not a full color screen, nor does it have full android 2.3 on it either. There are some development issues, and fcc licensing issues that have to be taken care of, and until they are, I would rather wait for a better product then get something rushed like the first pebble Won Rhee I asked for a refund can you tell me when I'll receive it?kickstarter where are you?you might be covered legally but wheat about your moral obligation?!!!!!!' Good luck for us all.. Thought that we might need that.. I expect the survey either this month or next month honestly and then the watch in our hands in June or July...honestly I'm in agreement with all the other backers. We're quickly coming up to 1 year after being fully funded. It takes about 10 seconds to write an update. Won, write one. One hundred grand. Say something, anything. It's a great watch, a great idea. If it's dead, tell us. If it's not, tell us. BUT, just tell us... "Creator WON RHEE on Feb 11 Thank you for the patience with the Vachen Smartwatch. We really want to get this product out into the market. We are still negotiating our options with our mass production company and are hoping to finalize the contract within the next week. The major parts of the watch have also been ordered. We are going to survey during March and will deliver the Vachen Smartwatch in the middle of April. The schedule is not fixed and if we have any changes for the schedule, we will post it. Thanks" That will mean if by the end of March no updates or survey being sent out, then most likely there wont be a Vachen anymore. Just my 2 cents. I'm waiting though. Hope that this will not be my Christmas gift. lol I'm with Avinish... Perhaps I'm a bit foolish, perhaps I just like this project / idea too much, but I'm willing to wait this one out and pray Won and Vachen deliver on this one. Even tho I now have five SmartWatches (and have many more on the way), I'm still actually looking forward to this one! I know things have not worked out the way he planned, but heres hoping Won can make things right and release this watch to the world. I am going to wait it out because it is a solid idea, and good ideas take time people, the wheel wasn't made in a day, neither was the first processor. We have to be patient! How to get refund? I don't wanna wait forever Have faith ! People . Please, How do I get a refund. Thanks I want a refund as well, how come no updates for months. It is really irresponsible.... Disappointed. I would like a refund please. The lack of communication is displeasing. There are many other options available now. Ones that are fully compatible with iphone. Pebble has released a new watch the pebble Steel which is available today. This project has been a major disappointment. I realize that projects have problems but the lack of communication and updates scare me. Please refund my money I have no interest in this project anymore. @Won Perhaps it is my browser but some videos for apps are not showing on the main page. 1] Please provide another estimated shipping date. 2] Please advise if watch hardware/battery specifications have changed in any manner. 3] Please advise status of app store and availability of watch faces and apps shipping with watch. Thank you. Refund..... Whats the status, figure out an option to get this on our wrists yet? Completely agree with Adam. How do I get a refund. Any chance of an update? I'm not being silly but it's been over two months since the last update. Beginning to feel like I've been duped out of my money here. Beginning to feel that this watch is going to be so obsolete when it eventually turns up that It will instantly be a paper weight. well, how goes the negotiations? dude come on i want my watch where is it !! Refund... Dears, no delivery = refund!!! Refund..... Refund....... Refund... Thanks for the update! I look forward to the survey! Holy smokes... Won you better not be foolin! Hi won Rhee I have been monitoring updates about the watch and noticed its not iPhone compatible with this in mind i would like a refund.good luck in the future. @Won Monthly updates [at a minimum] are expected -- even if to say you cannot get funding. I totally agree JZ. @Won has gone quiet for too long. Let the backers know what is going on. I feel that it's time to get a refund. It's going to take so long to actually get to production that the watch is going to be outdated before it's even released. They are using the Android OS and chose Gingerbread which at that time was already superseded by Honeycomb, Jelly Bean and now Kit Kat. Unfortunately, this entire project has had more problems than successes along the way and I have reached the point where lack of updates is going to be a problem throughout the life of the product. Please give an update (bad or good) and let us know if we can expect a product anytime soon... So "just before mass production!" Translation: make the actual watch 2-3 months or longer. Mass productions 2-3 months or longer. They apply for certification???! 2,3,6 months???? So from you're past reputation looks like a year or 2. Might as well invest in another watch else or make one myself. Either way I'll get it quicker. This is not how to run a company, project, or business venture. We all have good reason to be upset. Should we all just sit quietly and do nothing like you? Just wondering. Nothing else to say anymore. I'm done. Maybe we have to look him up in the phone book and give him call , just to say hi ! Creator WON RHEE on January 24 @Young Song - All the hardware in the watch are completed, including the motherboard. We have been optimizing the watch continuously, and with great progress. Now, we are right before the stage of mass production. In order to get the FCC/CE certification, we have to first get the actual product, instead of the prototype which we currently have. After we finish mass production and get the actual Vachen watch, we are then going to apply for the certification right away. Thanks From the last update, on the 24th, but things have been quiet here and on the facebook page for some time now. Tell us something. What have you spent this $110,000 dollars on. How goes the process of getting FCC certification? Any news? You haven't posted here for quite some time now, and that is what gives us the jitters and makes us think that things aren't going smoothly...seriously, just say something like "all is well" or "hey, we have a slight delay" something, anything... hello? Is anyone out there? I like the color screen, many other smart watches don't offer it. And the samsung thing only works with samsung phones, so this is the best choice still. I have a friend that wants to order one now that he has been looking at the Vachen facebook page and the updates here. @Mohamed - I agree. I should be getting my truesmart this week and Hotwatch sometime next month. But I really like the look of this watch. Also, how fluid the apps seem to run in the videos says more than I can compared to other watches I've seen demoed. The UI looks excellent, albeit simple. However, It does look to have had much more work put into it than the UIs of the droid4.0 watches. How is every one doing ? I backed 2 other watches .the "Hot watch " and "agent " .... O and the kreyos .... Can't wait for them to come in , but this watch has color unlike the others , I think that's why I'm drawn to it more ..... But that's my story :) Hello, let's just talk among us backers.. Hahaha.. Hello? seriously, I have a friend who wants to pre-order a watch, he wants to know when the website will allow him to pre-order ....................................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hi , I hope all is well . I still feel that this is the most "fluid" smartwatch. I also like the fact that it is designed as a watch movement that can be moved from casing to casing. That is a clever design feature. I back the Neptune Pine, the Hotwatch, and the Omate. Despite each of their uniques features or specs, I still believe that this watch has the the more aesthetic design and innovation. What is more is that the old casings would likely be reusable with future movements. That would be awesome too. Anyway, I just thought I'd post something in the comments lol. My @$$! Lmao. Kung Pow anyone? Dear Mr. Rhee, Would it be possible to give an update, good or bad? We are all very eager to hear how it is going! Thank you so much, Pieter What do you get when you cross and owl with a bungee cord Hi Mr. Rhee, I am an excited backer that doesn't mind waiting. I understand good things take time but if this will not be iPhone compatible as originally listed I would not be interested. Please update us! Thank you Brian When is the website going to allow pre-orders? I'm not surprised if they are not at baselworld this year. They didn't get any real orders last year when they attended (just inquiries). I would expect it to cost $$$ to travel there and to setup a booth. Money is something they barely have enough of now. I pre-ordered a pebble steel (been wearing the pebble on and off since April). The smart watch market is getting quite crowded. This year we can expect the ones from Apple and google. Both Pebble and Sony got a big head start. If Vachen wants to be a serious player in the market, it needs to get the SDK out asap and attract some big name partners to develop apps for it. Otherwise it will just end up being a fancy fashion accessory. 나는 밖으로 내 Vachen에 넣어 돈인가? The more important question is why are you not listed on baselworld.com right now, when your facebook page was talking about them? I've backed two different smart watches, and both of them are behind schedule. Neither of them are posting up updates every week or two weeks. They are both suffering at the hands of the manufacturers. The difference between the two is that here there are more people that think that prototyping and manufactuering is a quick and easy process, when in point of fact, these things take time. We need to calm down, and take a step back and realize that this is the problem with any new venture on this scale. If you've never been part of the process, then you are missinformed as to how the process works. You need money in hand to do the prototype, which they have, then you need to go to the producers and your own suppliers and negotiate the best deals so you can make money off of the completed project. And after all that you still have to wait for them to actually produce the thing, test it, and then ship it. All of this takes time, and can't be done in a few weeks, unless you don't want the best prices for the best components. The issue isn't about waiting, it is about us being patient. We have to give them more time to get the thing done properly. The current prototype is huge, I don't want something bigger then an Invicta on my wrist, If they were to produce the thing at the speed you are asking for that is exactly what we would have, this giant brick that we would never wear, not even to the formal events to show it off. Let them take the time it takes to produce a good product. Now all that being said, if after I recieve my watch and if it isn't perfect I will send it back and demand a refund. Good to hear from you Won! Happy New Year! So what I take from your comment is this, you guys had. design ready to go but you then got screwed by the production company you had lined up. Now, while continuing to pursue a production partner, you are tweaking and improving the watch in the extra waiting time. Did I understand that correctly? That is ok if that is what is happening. I just want to be sure I understand your comment. I look forward to hearing from you again Won. Wait, I actually back this project?? Totally forgot.. As all of us said, please provide more updates, whether it's good or bad. Something is better than nothing. All of us have waited. I'm sure that if there were regular updates, even every few weeks, no one would mind the delays even though it would be frustrating. But this feels like everyone is getting cheated. A delay in product and lack of communication make the product look more and more outdated. Wait?....at this moment not much of a choice. Let's see how it will par up to other products when it finally (if) comes out. Look when it comes down to it, kickstarters have never graunteed start times, just that they will start. Would I like to have my smart watch now, yes, but this is completly new technology, and there are unknowns to consider that people don't think of when starting out in production like this. You all need to chill out a little and give them some time. Won, please add more updates and let us know where you are in production. The most frustrating part of this project is not the delays but the complete lack of communication. Won please send out more updates! Tell your backers what is going on with the project both good and bad. The backers invested in this project and deserve more than you are providing back to them. Won, so are you saying that without "MORE" investors that watch will not be built? You had said you had secured all the funds needs for production of this watch back in August or September or... This is BS!!! Looks like January will come and go. You'll say "We are in the final stages. Just wait." February will come and go. You'll say "We are in the final stages. Just wait." Think I've waited enough. Good thing I'm looking elsewhere. Honestly one of the reasons this was interesting to me is there were not many options for smart watches. I would rather back out of this now if I can as there are multiple smart watches on the market. There are even ones that connect Bluetooth and can be used as a phone. Really the extended wait is unreal! And it is not fair to your backers. Get it done, stop procrastinating! Can I get my money back? I'm tired of waiting. @Won I wish you and your team some happy holidays and hope you'll take a few days down time. I believe you won't let us down -- and everybody needs some rest. @derek williams: This is what we are talking about with the unknown issues that arise in production. Any new product will face issues like this, and they are working through the problems as they come through. In any endevor there are known issues that they can plan for, unknown known issues they can make contigencies for, and unknown unknown issues that just spring forth. What it seems to have happened is the last one was worse then they anticipated for the original kickstarter, and they are looking for help form other sources to finish the product. They will get it done, and they will make a very good watch when it is said and done, they don't want to make a sub-standard watch and call it a day, they want to put their names on something they can be proud of, and I don't blame them for that. It's really troubling that they have to find external funding to complete our watches. hopefully you get something soon to put this into production but I agree with Max as long as you guys are updating me and this watch doesn't become a Museum piece by time I get it (and I actually get it) Ill be hanging around. Either way for a smart watch it has a nice design element to it which I like. So far I have only been stiffed hard by one Kickstarter but almost all of them have bene delayed but like any project it needs a good team to manage as well as build it and almost never are delivered based on the estimated dates. A lot of the info is not known until you start getting into sourcing and building the product. Looking forward to the finished product. @Stephen: My thoughts exactly. I also pledged because I strongly feel that the team is passionate and committed to this project. The issue I see is that the team is mainly made up of smart engineers but they lacked someone with strong project management skills. For a project of this size and complexity, they clearly underestimated the risks and challenges. They should have performed a detailed risk assessment of everything that could have possibly gone wrong and then to have identified measures to prevent/minimize/mitigate these risks. For this project, it seems that they had issues with one of their manufacturing partners and ended up needing additional funding. There are other kickstarters projects that I see where the project execution was perfect, but at the end, they got screwed by the fulfillment company (shipped wrong products to the wrong people, poor tracking of what was shipped and what was yet to ship). Or other projects that could not ship because of customs issues (poorly filled our paperwork). The worst projects are the ones where someone from the project team takes the money and disappears (iControlPad2). Let's try to stay positive. Kickstarters for me is a source of ideas and entertainment (ostrich pillow, anyone?). Happy holidays! :) Well said Stephen Coleman, I am still backing this one, and like every other kickstarter I have been a part of have all had similar issues with implementation of the idea. The unknown unknowns, not just the known knowns, the known unkonwns, but the things that nobody in their right mind would be able to foresee. I appreciate you taking the time out of your day and responding to my question. And for saying better what should/could have been said by so many other people. @Stephen Happy holidays. I hope you receive some punctuation and page breaks as gifts! :) I was just trying to lighten the mood with some nostalgia. Mwhahahaha. I didn't think it would be taken literally. Honestly I don't really care whether I get a watch or not. I backed this project to help them build a company that sells a cool/useful product. I knew that at any time they could take my money and go. But I took a gamble because I saw something I wanted to be a part of even if only thru a couple hundred dollar donation. I guess you could say that in a way I'm living vicariously in ways I never could by backing projects I wish I had come up with lol. That is not to say i couldn't but that it simply doesn't fit my plans. And I digress..... I mean more frequent updates (tri-/bi-weekly maybe?) would be nice, but I've backed projects with weekly updates, most of which end up being filler. All I want to see is a good product brought to market. Good products don't always have to have the latest OS or best hardware, it's in the ingenuity of the product, the seamless integration of form to function, and even creativity in how they tune the interface. All the bells and whistles in the world mean nothing if the way you interact with the product is painful. To me every update has looked better and better with this last one just looking beautiful. My only complaint is that my girlfriend will get to play with it before me. :(. And as far as all his "lies". All I can really say is I don't know why he made claims and promises he couldn't deliver on. I don't know all the factors, maybe he thought things would go that way, when in actuality he was just gullible to dates given to him, maybe he(won so were clear) is just shitty at PR, I don't know, so I reserve my judgement on how I interpret his actions. There's also a possibility of cultural behaviors that may be considered normal here, again i don't know. In some places/ to some people no news is good news. I'm just trying to make the point that Won has a perspective here too and I don't know it nor am I inclined to make a judgement on it without knowing him. What really bothers me the most with this project is people getting on here to bad mouth, in some cases not all, Won and in general post negative things on this comment thread. We all knew what we were getting into and we have no one to blame but ourselves. And though I'm sure I will, I don't want to hear about how it's what we "thought" we were getting into or this isn't the item we thought we were backing. I very well could be wrong here and apologize if i am, but i believe it said iOS support would be there but I don't recall them giving a specific time frame for it. I mean come on now. We all should have known this was a risk. An investment advisor would probably rate most kickstarters as high-risk investments and advise against them, and kickstarter isn't really even an investment on our part, it's more like a good faith donation. Investments yield returns, kickstarter does not, at least not for backers. But that's the point of kickstarter isn't it? To give someone a chance to make a dream, an idea, a business into a reality with nothing for us but a warm fuzzy feeling in our hearts? And if we're backing only for the gifts then can we really be so surprised that a kickstarter could fall through after being successfully funded? Is it not just as bad on our parts to say "I'll back you, but only because I get one of the products and only if it's on my terms"? I think it is because, again, kickstarter is meant to help people who can't, for whatever reason, get the funding they need to deliver a product. Kickstarter projects just seem to have become a **** ground for people who don't really understand what this is about. This is probably one of the reasons we don't hear from Won. It's a lose/lose situation when a piss fest begins. Project creators don't want to make best estimate claims for fear of retaliation or a demanding of "refunds" (we didn't actually purchase anything did we?), and backers get upset when updates with dates are missed or when an update, god forbid, doesn't have a date, and this vicious cycle just keeps going. I say we let them do their job and trust them to let us know when any pertinent issues arise that might affect us as backers, and then we handle those issues with a little poise and rationality. Even through Wons botched updates I still feel no reason to think Won is not doing his job. I still feel that Won is passionate about this project, just not in ways some necessarily would like (Communication.... I'm looking at you Won ), but in the ways that matter. I have no reason to doubt that there have been some Murphy-esqe complications here. All I know is that I like what I see so far and as long as this is a successful launch with or without a watch (fingers crossed for with) I'm cool with that. On another note I would like to apologize for the long post, I've just been waiting to............... See you guys around the next update, or not. ALSO. To all it may concern from all walks of life Happy Holidays if its in season for you and if not I simply wish that you fare well in life's journey. Have a good night guys. Joke: Why couldn't your nose have been 12 inches long? what would you suggest Stephen Coleman to sweeten the situation? No iPhone support = I would like a refund as well as it was promised earlier. Just a spoon full of sugar helps the medicine go down. ? Won Rhee you never answered the comment regarding this not being iPhone compatible. This was advertised with being iPhone compatible. I would like a refund. so, what is the new eta won rhee? If you don't have one, that is one of the expectations with a kickstarter, sometimes production takes more time then anticipated. Please let us know what is going on, and what the new time table looks like. I also would like a refund now as this project is just one delay after another and now behind all others now on the market , plus no iphone support which was promised at the start !! I would also like a refund. This has been project has been a waste of my time and money. Please refund me. I can't wait any more. @Won Are you still planning to post videos of the completed watch this week? Proof of progress very soon will be the only reason I stick with this project at this point. Won I would like a refund. Please see the following statement.... @trevor shigeoka, you took the words right out of my mouth.... Ditto "VACHEN’s strongest point is speed. We have the ability to launch new models faster than any other company. A new model will be released every 45 days." Can't even get the first model released. I paid for this thing back on May 13th. If this does not work with iphone I don't want it and I want a refund. When I paid, the website says it works with ios qnd iphone. I have an iphone and am not switching phones. Longer I wait the angrier I get. More and more bad news every update. Keeps getting pushed back and now doesn't even work with iphone. I am regretting backing this project as there are many other options out there now. Has anyone that request a refund received it ? Really disappointed the watch won't be IPhone compatible. That was one of the key features I wanted, as I have an IPhone. Please process and issue me with a refund ASAP. I don't want this watch anymore. Far too many delays and now this news about the IPhone. I don't want to wait for my refund. Hi Won I'm sorry but I also request a refund. I've tried to be patient but due dates keep getting pushed back and have lost faith in delivery. Please process my refund as soon as possible. "VACHEN’s strongest point is speed. We have the ability to launch new models faster than any other company. A new model will be released every 45 days." Can't even get the first model released. I paid for this thing back on May 13th. If this does not work with iphone I don't want it and I want a refund. When I paid, the website says it works with ios qnd iphone. I have an iphone and am not switching phones.

I am regretting backing this project as there are many other options out there now. Has anyone that request a refund received it ? Is it true that you are no longer able to support iPhone when you ship and I will have to wait 8 months? Please confirm as this is of no use to me if it doesn't work with my phone and I am not switching phones. to Matthew Searle: I thought I had seen that, thanks for pointing out that it was the last update. The last project update says "As of now, everything is going smoothly but we cannot predict the unexpected. We expect that the delivery date will be the end of Nov or early Dec." Now, there's a comment which says early January 2014, but the watch will be completed next week. Hi Won, I agree with all. Terrible way of handling customer service. My friend, you have to learn a lot before starting of any new venture. I might sound offensive but this is a fact. I would like a refund. Not interested anymore in your product. It was a real bad experience. Please process a refund ASAP. Hi,I would like a refund please. Won, I would like a refund please. Won, I'm afraid I'm with the others. I've been about as patient as I am prepared to be. No watch, no iPhone compatibility, and poor customer service, are terrible business models. You have ruined your business before really getting started. I'll take my money back and wait for the iWatch which will likely be out in 6 months. Please return my money soonest as I would like to put it into a more useful and better run venture. wait, wasn't there an update a little while ago about the watch being delivered at the end of november? DID all the ones requesting refunds get them. Ah, the usual for this project. October 26 - "We expect that the delivery date will be the end of Nov or early Dec." Followed by three weeks of silence. Prediction - mid-December, another update which ends "We expect that the delivery date will be the end of Jan or early Feb. Please be patient" And maybe another little bombshell in that as well, like the comment in the last update which reveals that the watch won't work with iPhone for 8 months WON - Talk to me my friend... Won, This is getting old.... Be a professional and give us some real answers. Just be honest with us. I think we as your backers deserve that in the least. Worst part is Won logs in on his Kickstarter account regularly… BUT IGNORE ALL BACKERS AND THEIR COMMENTS. What a SHAME! Added message people will respect you more! Won just be honest with people if your in the shit tell them Please update status of the product I been very patient with the project, I understand new projects take time but it's delay after delay, poor communication and lack of updates. Now the whole thing with the Bluetooth compatibility license for the iphone seems like it's going to be a new and huge excuse for another delay, I am very very disappointed with the project it's feels like it's more of a concept rather an actual project. I doubt this project will be done this year I know it's going to take more time and I've lost my patients. Won I'm no longer happy with this project and for that reason alone I ask for a FULL REFUND @Won: Any updates? I hope your team is doing good... Please share progress. Hi Won, I am sorry to say that i have lost interest/faith in this project ever materializing and as a result i would like a refund, I wish you the best of luck Brendan In the update #30 videos, there a some color LED flashes coming from the bottom of bezel which appears to be unfinished (not closed). Will these still be visible on the finished watch? If so, I think it would be nice if those could be disabled. Can they used as a secondary notification? Won, I got another question. When the watch finally is complete, will there be a choice of straps available? Either a choice to be sent with the watch and/or available to buy (additionally) to switch straps? Ok so you showed us some pictures....again. But when the hell are you shipping this watch out???? Come on enough is enough. You wanted October. Well it has come and quickly passing by. I'm not gonna even ask for updates anymore. I want to know when is it shipping out. Period. I have come to expect delays in any kickstarter project, often significant ones. Three month delay (July to October) or more is perfectly acceptable by my standards. What is absolutely not acceptable however, is the lack of transparency, the poor communication and the complete lack of respect shown to kickstarter backers. I am seriously considering my commitment to this project and am considering my options on requesting a refund. Hi Won, I was really hoping that your project would be a success and one of the key part in that success was that you would be among the first out there. This has not happened unfortunately which has left me in a position that I lost my interest in this and would like a full refund. So please make a refund to my account ASAP. Thanks and a wish you good luck with shipping the Vachen watch to other backers. /Johan This project is looking like it is crumbling. All of these backers requesting refunds how are they supposed to finish this project when they have already stated they are out of money and seeking financing elsewhere and processing returns for some people. I can understand why people want refunds.. I mean we still haven't seen a working watch or a timeline. Unless I do not receive my refund in the time Won agreed to through private message, I will not be posting here anymore. Good luck to you all and I hope the wait is worth it.... I have requested refund from several backed projects that are 5+ months in the making and way past their deadlines. No more KS drama for me... @Won Won, please respond with an update that has a realistic timeline that we, your backers, can believe in and hold you to. Please take this chance to reassure us that Vachen will deliver. @Won I agree with the comments below please issue a refund to my account. Let me know if I need to do anything else to get my refund processed. Thank you for your understanding. Judging by the size, reputation and the fact that the company is located in Korea, any action as a group would have little or no effect on the future of Vachen @ Amro, making a group of dissatisfied customers is not necessary to simply ask for a refund. The size and reputation of the company, as well as it's location in Korea, would not be impacted at all by this action. I, for one, do not need a "rant group" to take the load off of my chest. I will simply ask for a refund. So, Won, Vachen Watch, you have failed me and my trust, time, money and effort I spent being your cheerleader when you couldn't do it yourself. I am kindly asking that a refund be made to my account ASAP. Thank you. Dear Mr Won and the Vachen team. I have so far been very patient with your company . I eagerly funded your kickstarter project with no reservations whatsoever because I liked the product concept you were selling to the world. I , however , did so based on the promise that if funding was successful , the product would be delivered within July . I have since learned a painful lesson on the inability of internet companies to be honest with their customers. All of your customers , as a collective , trusted you hard enough to put their hard earned money into a project that was the brainchild of a reputable brand , such as sony or apple , but one that was pretty much unheard of before the start of this kickstarter campaign. That shows alot of trust . You so far have shown little appreciation for that trust by the fact that you have repeatedly delayed the delivery date of this product. Had you told us from the beginning about the problems you were having with production then many of us would have not invested in your watch. The reason is that many , if not most of us invested in your watch because we wanted to be the first adopters of a real smartwatch that actually works. Many of us were technologically up to date enough to be aware of the fact that your main competitors , Samsung , Sony and Qualcomm were working on similar products that would hit the shelves by fall of 2013. We did not want to wait for such late arrivals and so we subsequently chose to purchase your watch based on the earlier delivery date compared to your competitors . But time and time again you have tried to keep us from raising our voices by teasing us with new projected delivery dates . Lies done in the name of having us hold on for just a little longer. That is not the way to market a product . The moral , and many would argue the smart way to sell a product would be to be completely honest with your customers , not from now , not from a month ago , but from the get go . When all trust is lost , even new promises , ones that are made in all honesty , become very hard to believe. Not wanting to feel ancient amongst my peers by being the only one with a dumbwatch , I have since purchased both the Samsung and the Sony smartwatch 2 and I'm also looking forward to the release date of both the Omate and the Qualcomm releases. Even if , by some miracle of God , your watch were to be delivered to us tomorrow. It would not be given nearly the sort of attention that it would have received had it been released before its competitors . Now , due to its late arrival , it would appear almost as if it was just another SmartWatch clone. At least thats how the market would see it. Theres only one thing you can do to save your reputation now . The right thing would be to reimburse those customers that want their money back so that they could use it to purchase smart watches that actually exist in the marketplace. You have realize that many of us no longer want an outdated watch . Its like you sold us the idea of an old brick phone in the 1990s only it to deliver after the release of the iphone. I am sure some of you out there may disagree with some of the harsh criticism that the seller has received , but ladies and gentleman , this is business administration 101 . Its not rocket science . You dont promises you arent entirely sure you cant keep . Investors are like shareholders , they have a right to know about what is going on in a company that they are essentially part owners of. Theres no doubt that Mr Won is a smart man . He , being a member of the tech industry , is well aware of the fast pace of change and innovation that this sector goes through. What is a groundbreaking product today , becomes prehistoric tomorrow. Oh and last of all to you Mr Won , I , on behalf of other disgruntled customers , apologize for the harsh criticism that we have all given you , but you have made enemies of the the most patient members . I have started a group on behalf of everyone here who isnt satisfied with the customer service that they have received so far . Please contact me at <email> for more information. @George, I am sorry but after your comment I have good reason to believe that you do not understand how KS works. Investing here, do you feel more like a VC or a stock market player? Your answer should be revealing. Please don't think of this as any form of personal attack. I am just trying to get a better feel of different rationales behind investing in KS. Thank you. I am disappointed, but still hope for a successful outcome and it seems like there is a path that may lead there. Regarding the sometimes vicious concern that others have expressed, I have a different outlook. I happen to have funds in the stock market. I receive no guarantees there nor have I received any on KS. If I want to make 100% sure I receive a watch, I will order one from Amazon. On KS, there is some risk and I never put in money that I can't afford to lose. If a KS project fails to deliver, I probably wouldn't subscribe to another from the same person, but this project does not seem to have reached that point yet. Having backed a few KS projects, I think they all have been late; some VERY late. It's entirely appropriate to expect (and demand) updates, but overall I think folks should chill a little. Won, based on your last update (thanks for the honesty, though), I would say you pretty much admitted that Vachen defaulted on its Kickstarter campaign: the amount of funds required to secure production of Vachen Watch v1.0 was insufficient to complete the project. Bearing this in mind, how do you expect for ANY of the backers to be patient and wait it out until you receive external funding (which is absolutely out of our control)? The money you got from us was supposed to get you to a WORKING prototype and fully worked out plan for mass production ready to go. Instead, it seems like this KS project was nothing more than a showcase to get other, real investors on board. I will stick to my previous post in terms of a time for a working prototype unveiling, but at this point I have lost all hope of this ever becoming a reality. Won, it's expected you'll sell orders outside of Kickstarter as well. The sooner the product is delivered, the sooner you can start additional sales via your website. @Won - Although I doubt anyone is happy about the delay- I want to hear the problems, the hold ups, even the pain. Part of the 'reward' for this project, at least to me, is the candor and the lessons. I personally would rather have more candid updates. So when will we all know if you get the extra funds or not? This project has been beset with communication "problems" from the very beginning, and now that we are five months after the end of the project, it's STILL HAPPENING. There's been no formal schedule update since August, yet Won MUST HAVE KNOWN that there were issues that would mean that the timeline would slip. Even in the past 17 days, the schedule has moved by another few weeks, but there's still no proper project update!! So if you want to have any clue about when the watch might eventually ship, you have to search through here for the few comments from Won which give any clue about the deadlines. Here's a brief summary of the delivery promises to date: WON RHEE on Jun 17 - We are doing best to follow our schedule. Please wait for a while. Update 14 - the first set of watches that were due to be shipped by July will now ship by August WON RHEE on Jul 5 - We are committed to shipping the VACHEN smartwatch at the end of Aug. WON RHEE on Aug 5 - I am very sorry about late update but I hope everybody knows my situation....We will update this progressing situation as soon as possible. Update #19 Aug 15, 2013 - We have now secured funding to produce and ship our products, so we do not foresee any funding related delays. WON RHEE on Sep 19 - We are doing best to make a delivery date. WON RHEE on Sep 20 - We are trying our best to release the Vachen Smartwatch on the projected date, which is late Oct/early Nov. WON RHEE 5 days ago - We are doing best to meet the delivery on schedule. WON RHEE 1 day ago - Currently, Vachen is making the engineering sample before we can go into the mass production stage. WON RHEE about 3 hours ago - we can finally create the completed version of the Vachen Smartwatch in late October and after we test the watch, we can then start distribution and delivery sometime during late November....This way, we can higher the percentage of us delivering the completed watch by November...Hold on to us for a little bit longer because we are almost done. So no update?!? Won we know you have/had issues with production but we want updates. I thought you had solved the funding issue back in August and now you're saying you have more funding issues? All of this should have been dealt with prior to starting this project. It takes X amount of dollars to make Y. Bulk of Y may get you a discount of X. ...etc. Anyway, as I have asked in earlier posts.... Update. How are you still making an "engineering sample?" You should be in final stages of production and assembly according to your own previous timeline. EVERYTHING should be 90% or more complete. These lacks brings me to another point. Let's say you complete and actually deliver this watch sometime these decade, what about support? Seems like this watch tech will already be a little behind other watches. If we have issues with the watch will tech/customer support have the same issues and lack of response as the company currently does? I'm trying to stay positive but other companies I have invested in (past and present) have much better updates/timelines/customer satisfaction than Vachen. Tell us the good, bad, and ugly. What do you have to lose by telling us everything? You'll lose us all if you don't. Just saying. The ball is in your court. I'm agree with the rest. I'm looking for a firm release date on the watch or I am also looking for a refund. There are already other competitors on the market with products similar to yours and if you can not offer something different than their's for the time that your taking to produce the product I am looking to go somewhere else. I'm with Dragan. One week time limit to produce evidence of progress and a valid timeline for delivery. I work in software and have weekly status meetings with the customer. Vachens lack of communication with its customers is unacceptable. I would also like a refund if you can not produce a timeline or pictures of the finished prototype. Won, I am sorry but Vachen is simply not delivering. Your product is becoming obsolete as time goes by and delivery dates are being pushed late into 2013. I am not willing to cut you any slack anymore and will not accept further delays. If you are not ready to show a fully assembled watch by this time next week I will initiate a refund procedure with my credit card company rather than Vachen directly. I will do this not because I do not believe that you will issue a refund yourself. I will do this because you have been given a "loan" of over $100K for 5 months,with not only no interest, but profit in your pocket as it costs you well under $169 to produce your cheapest watch. It has been close to 5 months after the transaction between your company and the "investors" occurred and we have not received the product in return for our investment. ANY credit card will initiate the refund process after hearing this fact and I will eventually get my money back. Vachen, however, will receive a "red flag" on its record and disbursement of funds in the future may be halted. I am sorry but you leave me with no choice. I have been with you all the way diluting fundraising but this charade has to stop. Won, I get that you are still producing a prototype and that there have been some setbacks if you still don't have an assembled watch because calculations are difficult can we at least see the components you're working with. I know I'd like to see what the watch will look like on a wrist, even if the intelligence isn't loaded. Can you show us a shell? Hi Won, seeing that we are close approaching the new release date, can we see the fully assembled watch? so things are going smoothly? When do you expect to ship Won Rhee? Won, What a waste of comment!!! How about addressing important questions and refrain from repeating empty phrases.... Please show us the fully assembled, functional watch...you should have one by now.. Update? I had a July delivery date, not October/November. @Dragan: +1 Won, Any new updates? I am sure that, if things are moving according to your plan, you must have at least one "prototype" watch assembled that you can take a picture/video of... I need to stress the importance of Vachen showing its backers that some work is actually being done and project is moving forward. I believe you had a prototype with same capabilities as shown in your demo videos back at Basel... Who is to say that what you have shown us is not that exact same watch, in production, a year ago..... I want to see progress, and you are simply not delivering... Update would be nice and even seeing a fully complete watch too! Won, what' the status on my refund? Did anyone else received one? Won, you remember that nice long update you posted a while ago on how you and the Vachen stood in production and everything else? You also promised updates and timelines. You're slacking again. You need to keep everyone in the loop to keep the faith here. By now you should be finished with most things and ready for assembly. Prioritize!!! The website and videos and such are wonderful but the production and assembly of the watch is more important, no? Come on you're at least responding to posts. Do better and update us all. Are you 85%-90%-95% done here? I'm hanging on with you but the ice is getting thinner. Did the case design change at all? Can we see the watches in the finished cases? As much as I love the videos of the watch in pieces doing different things, with only a week until October (bearing in mind the "early October" delivery date), are there any pictures of a watch that has been put together yet?? By now, I would expect that there is a production line churning them out, ready to be packaged and shipped. Either that, or an update which says that the new delivery date is 2014 (or whenever, I'm just being optimistic here). Won't the watch need CE certification before it can be shipped to Europe - that is going to take a few weeks at least. Bearing in mind the problems that Pebble had shipping to Germany, how far along the certification and documentation path is Vachen??? (Answer I'd guess is nowhere) Do you have a watch fully complete and assembled that we may see? Thanks for the update! Looking forward to using the vachen watch. Sorry to see all the negativity... Hope everything goes well from here on out. Won, due to all the incomplete updates, failure to give us exact dates and news about the completion of the product, i ask nicely to receive a refund, as soon as possible. Thank you. I backed it so Ill hang it. I knew the risks but lets get some shots of the watch cases and other pieces. I would assume these parts could be worked on why you guys are working on software issues. a case is a case etc. Been seeing a lot of blueprints or simulated or real faces. Lets see some hardware Won, your last ship estimates were October/November, depending on the model. Based on the progress you claim, I can safely say that there is NO WAY for Vachen to do good on October delivery. You owe us an updated shipping estimate and more concrete proof that you are working on a real product. Yes, really, what is the proposed delivery date, Won? Give yourself a good 3-4 weeks extra and let us know ASAP. I will hold you to this, but it better be before the end of November. That is over two months from now and I think it is reasonable to expect shipment in this time. Please respond. When is the new delivery date? @Dragan - I understand your points. All I'm saying is that I think Won will come through. I cannot way when though. If you truly believe this project will not happen in a reasonable time from now [or ever] then, by all means, pursue whatever avenues you need to pursue. I just don't think it's fair to request a refund for a delayed project. It's the nature of the beast...damn near every project I back [and there are a few] are late. Yeah, I'd be pissed if I got ripped off [and it's happened]....but I personally think Won will come through. It's true that the delays mean the market is getting more flooded every day in the smart watch arena..but I rolled the dice... @won Don't keep us in the dark. You have to be honest with your backers. If you have a reasonable delivery date I might stay in but if it is unreasonable I want a refund. @Won I would like to request a refund. @dragon Same here how can I ask for a refund @Dragan - How can one ask for a refund? So when is the projected delivery date? @ Trogdor, you are correct. But if you remember, I was pretty harsh on their lack of marketing prowess and doing their own "pushing". The idea of a stylish smart watch with a color screen appealed to me and I sincerely wanted this project to get funded so I can get my hands on one of Vachen watches. However, as you may have noticed Won and Co. have provided very little if any progress proof to us. Remember, they had to have a working prototype to qualify this project for KS funding. So how bad was the prototype to have to start from scratch in order to make a commercial product? Prototype looked quite legit so I do not understand... So, was I pumped for this project to get funded? Yes! Am I still? Not so much! When will I get out is for me to decide. However, I will NOT be taken for a ride as long as there is a viable refund option on the table. I feel it is my duty to inform the other ~480 backers of their options. @Dragan - you were one of the big pushers for this project to get funded. I tend to believe this project will get completed but not Oct or even Nov [Won - please feel free to contradict here. If you're going to get out, do it now. Otherwise wait it out. My 2c There is a project that was VERY well funded yet is still failing to deliver to the backers. There is a growing number of backers using their CC companies to get a refund on a technicality. The kicker is that it has to be within 5 months of the payment date. Vachen got funded some 5 weeks after the project in question so dissatisfied parties could use this route to get their money back. If there are any additional delays with Oct/Nov delivery, I think we should all consider this. Won, please, please deliver on the promises and have this product ready to ship by November. Otherwise, be prepared to refund $100K.... Hi Won, as per the other comments is the Oct/Nov 2013 delivery dates still achievable? I would hate to think that all of this is a scam and that in the backers good faith we will not receive anything. Hope to hear from you soon. Like the updates but is there any news on the eta? Any updates? I know everything is ramping up but a simple quick update about where we are would be appreciated. Any news or Est. delivery time right now? @Won any updates? It has been a week since your last update. What is the progress right now? Have you already got an estimation delivery time? Yes, an update, regardless of how short, would be nice...Thanks! BTW, could you please address my previous question about if there are Vachen watches out there (have you delivered any outside this KS campaign?) @Won How are things coming along? Are there any watches fully complete that we can see? Any info will be highly appreciated. I am watching US Open semis between Nadal and Gasquet and there is a guy sitting right behind Toni Nadal wearing what seems to be a Vachen watch!!! Exactly the same case and watch face as in the KS page!!!! Won, were you guys already selling these earlier this year in Basel??? Or have you already sterted shipping the Baselworld orders but not KS orders??? Looking at update they have made a decent amount of them. It did hurt with posting an aggressive timeline. Like other smart watches they have delivery dates of next year from the get go C'mon guys, have a little faith. I just want a good and nice watch. We already paid for it, so we decided we can spare those money for a watch. Won, just do your best in order to deliver a good product. By the way, were are we on the time line? We need specifics How do you request a refund? I would like this as well I am confused now? Are you refunding everyone or just certain people that request it? So are you refunding everyone? Just called Amazon to find out what's going on with my refund for this watch. I was told by Don Won Ree that it was processing and that he talked to Amazon over a week ago. Just got off the phone with them to find out there was no call on his part or refund going through. That's strike 3 and you are out! It's now my mission to make sure you gain nothing from this project. Even though your doing a good job of that on your own! @Avinish - I dread to think how late Vachen will be if they decide to upgrade to JellyBean!! @won Any new updates on completion or any new pics? @ Matthew Searle, The only way they can keep Vachen in the conversation is if they upgrade the o.s. to jelly bean, so it can do everything that none of the other smart watches can. Right now the only thing going for it is the fact that it is a color screen. @matthew its def. an up hill battle now. The main attraction of backing Vachen originally was that this was going to be a reasonably good watch which was guaranteed to ship in July (quote from Won May 28: we guarantee to deliver them on time for the kickstarter backers.) Now, it's looking very old-hat - Android 2.3 (current version is 4.3) with very little support and apps, which might eventually ship at some stage this year. With the Samsung Galaxy Gear due to come out September 4th, I can't see any demand for the Vachen apart from the original backers here. Hi Won, thank you for the update. It's great to see actual developed hardware. The screens look great already! Looking forward to the final product. Have the cases been changed at all? I've also backed this, which may very well make it out before the Vachen especially if you pledge for the developer version. <url>"we support you"... Yes we all did, but do any still do?¿ how many would like a refund? I hope to be wrong, but its smells scam to me, and if not it will come out so late, even the Iwatch will be better. (and i´m not an apple fan). No pix, No info, No regular updates, No nothing = scam. @Won: since you came online to reply us so I don't want to miss this rare opportunity but for asking if we can have some photographs of watch in production… some close-ups of engineers working on the end product… etc. We support you!!! One of the biggest perks that got me to back this product had been the timeframe to which it would become available. Now with the release being pushed back I can only hope we get a product that is still comparable to many other smart watches that have hit the market by that time. Not to mention most of them having lower price points. I have to say I'm getting a little nervous.. A agree with most of the comments being left by fellow backers. I would guess the watches are at least 6 months away. They are still designing everything, including the electronics of the watch. This campaign is disappointing. I understand delays but I was under the impression this watch was pretty much ready to hit production with a few minor tweaks. This is the risk we all take with KS. Oh well im sure it will be a fine watch. Won, please update us on your progress. Is anything closer to completion. You had noted that some things were 50-70% complete. An update one or twice a week would be great. Thanks. What I have understood from backing Vachen project is that without COMMUNICATION any project, idea and even Kickstarter platform looks and vibes as SCAM… and not STARTUP. Won: No communication from you has muddled the difference between both the words. I hope it ends well… Is there any options to get a refund? I don't believe a "good faith effort" has been made all signs currently are pointing to taking the money and running. This user's account has been deleted. Things can happen but all we are asking is to keep us frequently updated (whether it be good, bad or ugly.) First apologies for this long post: Actually quotes: May 1: we are in the final stages of additional apps. We are certain they will be finished prior to out production launch. May 16: we are currently developing the smart functions and a video of it will come out soon. May 24: we are almost at the final stage which is pilot product 4th step. We are confident we can deliver the smart watch to our backers on time, when we are successful with funding. May 25: we do want to assure you that we are not a "take the money and run" operation. We are absolutely committed to this project and our backers. The main struggle that we have been facing is communication with backers since English is our second language. But the company is based in South Korea and California. May 26: we are preparing the optimized android systems and developed app is final step of kickstarter version. May 28: we do not develop the prototype version anymore and now we develop kickstarter edition. Because we guarantee to deliver them on time for the kickstarter backers. Please understand that there is a time difference ... so don't think that we're ignoring you just because we don't respond within a couple hours after your post. Now we develop the standard the standard version for kickstarter backers, not prototype version. May 29: we are ready to go when we receive our funding. We have been developing the products. What happened with all of these "final stages and development of standard version" back in May? Now you are saying you are only 50-70% done? You should've let us in the loop. "Absolutely committed to the project and backer?" Then show us. Seems like things changed after you got OUR funding. "Time difference and struggle with communication?" Well in May you posted 91 times, June 5 times (after you got the funding) and August once (now twice). Please don't go with the trend and not respond. Don't "take the (our) money and run." Not sure how solid (if at all) your guarantees are. It's the facts. this trend was concurrent even when the project had started, exactly what i thought has happened, low resources and a watch that is going to be outdated when it comes out, lack of communication was always the problem, i hope its not the case for future cuz i feel for the fellow backers who have got a bigger pledge, im one of the 1 dollar backers, hope this trend improves and the Vachen is one of a kind At least we got an update saying how stressed out the vachen team was! The worst thing about this (just my $0.02) is that this project had almost ZERO chance of getting funded some 3-4 days before the campaign end date. Then, WE gave marketing ideas to Won, WE pulled really hard for this cause and made it happen. I would like to hear again from the "$5000 guy" who pledged generously and pretty much saved this project. Do you feel disappointed? Betrayed? Lied to? Cheated? I understand that investing in KS is a risk but if this whole site becomes a platform to make a quick buck ( or 100...grand ), and disappear, then it should be abandoned by its users... My best guess, we get our "product" in a Pebble-ish fashion ( time wise ) and of inferior quality ( remember, the OS and features of this promised "smart watch" will be HEAVILY outdated as early as this fall!!!) Blah....wasted money... I'm going have to agree... We are your backers and without us you wouldn't have the funding that you have today and you treat us with no respect. We want to be a part of the process and you have given us no pictures, videos, or details of where you are at in the process. It sounds like the project is in shambles with no milestones so everything is being worked on at once. You set a hard timeline and you tell us it's pushed back until August, but here we are half way through August and we don't hear anything except all of the stuff you still have left. Excuse my French but this is bullshit, no WON, no updates, no set shipping date.. only mistery, confusion and unsatisfy bakers!!! WHATS GOING ON WON! His last log in was aug 4. Any photos of the watch being built would be awesome! Won, you say that you working on a lot of things currently. So how many people are helping you with this project? Is it just you doing everything or do actually have other people assigned to different part/tasks to accomplish this goal? What stage are you at? Meaning, is it still an idea in your mind? Is it just a blueprint? Is going or gone to production? If any part has gone into production, then what stage? Is this project more than you thought and can't make it a reality? We do have a right to know these questions because WE invested in this project that you promised to make a reality. You know, other are many many other projects out there, including other smart watch projects, that give the backer constant updates (good and bad) and sometimes too many, but guess what....the backers love it. They are informed and this, yes this, is what will keep your "stress from us" down. So please just tell us like it is. If you think you are frustrated think again because we have invested money into this. We are not asking for much; just information. If you do they other people working for you then you should assign one to give the backers some updates. Hi Won… I agree you are Super Busy with so many things going on (…but as a Product Developer you would have anticipated that) What I am not able to understand is what is holding you back from talking to us… All we are asking for is Updates… what's the progress?… Its mid-August almost… What are you up to? ARE YOU LISTENING? Hi won. I don't eant to be rude, but you have not given us an update since one month ago. The fact that you are stressesd trying to accomplish all of the necessary steps at once, unfortunately, is not an update. We all knew that. What is going on with the project? At what stage we are right now? When is the mass production planned to start? When is the shipping planned to start? Thank you for the update. This is all we want to hear as backers is things are progressing and that you haven't abandoned us. Just keep us in the loop regardless of good news or bad. Being in the dark sucks and makes us think the worse. Thank you for reply. This is all we are asking for, the progress of the things you are doing. So would it be correct to say that we should not expect the watch to be delivered this month then? Won has logged in an seen all the comment but has yet to comment on timelines or a new schedule. Please answer some of these important questions before people start seeking refunds. We all love the watch and just are seeking answers and the product we invested in. I think, Won, either you are SUPER BUSY working in Project or SUPER BUSY finding excuses for not responding… I hope it's not the second option. I am sorry but your attitude towards all backers is disgraceful. Don't run away… I This user's account has been deleted. Won, 2 weeks ago you decided to comment on how the watch is being charged. How is a "micro USB cable" more important or of a higher priority to comment on then the many many questions regarding an update? All we, the backers, are asking for is an update. If the production is on time, great. If it is late, then tell us. I believe most will be appreciative for being open. All we want is openness and avoidance of a "pebble-like" fiasco. Just tell us, Won. Some news pertaining to the production. Not pictures. Not cables. Actual timeline. 2+ weeks since the last update?!? Any progress to report? Won… FYI… IT'S AUGUST!!!! WHAT'S THE UPDATE? I hope you are not ignoring us. What's the new date of delivery now? Any news? Less than four weeks to go until the watches ship - yay! Looking forward to the shipping dates - it's less than 30 days now. We know that the project is behind schedule and understand the optimization issue. Can you PLEASE let us know what exactly is going on now. Are we past the optimization? Are we done final final prototypes and have we moved to final production??? Any news about your production would be highly appreciated!!! i would love an update on the time frame, are these still set for august instead of july? has it been pushed to september? things like that. also what is the time frame for the app ask i would love to get a head start on making watch faces i would like to have. Hey Won. Can you give an update? What is going on with Vachen? Are there problems in the production department? Let us know. This user's account has been deleted. I am pretty disappointed with the progress and updates we as backers have been given. I understand the long process however if it weren't for us, won never would have gotten this project off the ground.... Won, is it too much to ask for to get regular updates from you? I was really excited about this project, but now after being left in the dark, I am not so sure. I hope things change for the better! So do we have a timeline yet? Will the phone be charged by USB? If not What will happen in countries with different electricity voltages? @All: They should be at least take picture of the actual product/production, instead of computer monitor. In my opinion, one that has time to take picture of his computer screens, must have time to take picture of the so-called product. @Nishant: My friend, 'Respect' that's the word I was looking for… But I am sure you will agree too that to run any business successfully, of all basic ingredients required MUTUAL RESPECT is one. When I say mutual that means from both sides… When Backers ask the questions Mr. Business should be there to address and not keep mum for ages… as well as a Backer we have put our money and support the project which shows our Respect to Mr. Business. You tell me how hard is it for a team of SUPER BUSY professionals to come back update their backers… Ironically they are busy making product for us but still they are not available to give us Update. I totally agree with you on what you have said but I am sure you will agree with me on this. PEACE!! For a great product to be developed, it needs to go thru multiple phases of testing, re-design, troubleshooting, and many unexpected outcomes which would need further correction. Also, as many of us already know, it is no longer only the hardware that people want to buy, but the innovation in the software abilities and the actual applications which have become a part of us. I believe Won will deliver at the end of august. @Arnd Jurczyk it doesn't suit me, I understand how to run a real business. Any new business demands respect, and with every demanding new customer they can just walk right back out the door with nothing in their hand. A real business doesn't need that type of customer. This user's account has been deleted. Any update? Are you still on schedule? Thanks for the pics but a few words about your progress and being on schedule, in my opinion, helps better. A lot of people are on the edge of their seats waiting to get this awesome watch. More-frequent updates greatly appreciated. Thanks. I agree, I'm sure Won is super busy, and from what I've seen and what he has posted, things look like they are on a good track. Updates shouldn't take much time (even for the super busy). Short but frequent updates help prove to the backers that things are moving forward, which is important, especially in light of other projects that have failed to launch. @Nishant: I agree with you… and agree that Won and his team is super busy. But keeping all updated with progress once fortnightly is good practice. Like you even I want the best product well tested come to us. No pressure on team but an update here and there will keep the eagerness and morale high. @Atul. My comment wasn't towards the backers support or towards you. its about understanding what it takes to make such a watch. I'm sure won is super busy and up to his neck in emails and comments about nagging unappreciative backers. but that's not my point. My comment can relate to the recent update we had and to the precision of work they are doing. the casing, integrity, electrical circuits come in at tenths, if not hundredths of thousands of an inch. you would not want a watch if you bumped it somewhere and it shorted out. Everything has to be checked and rechecked again and again. Won and his team are working hard each and everyday to get us the best possible watch(s). @Nishant: Chill Out! it's not I and all other backers don't support… the reason we are backers is because we support. There is NO harm in asking a question and for update. WE ALL SUPPORT and its everyone's right to ask. It's not eagerness because even I love to wear a watch that should be SMART and not by name but by CALIBER. Everybody needs to chill out and relax and have some patience. No need to cry about this deadline and that update. Do y'all even know what it takes to build a watch of this caliber?? apparently NO. bu t I do cause I have tried to make my own and let me remind y'all that It takes a lot hard work, commitment and dedication to make some thing this complex. WON Keep working hard and do what you do best. I SUPPORT YOU, YOUR COMPANY, AND YOUR WATCH. Won: When can we say a FINISHED PRODUCT???? It seems you are not interested in talking to the backers. Don't be calculative on when to reply and when not. Keep your backers informed and involved. I hope you will reply… you MUST reply., @Matthew, it's funny you say that, because the skeptic in me read it as exactly "at the end of August (and probably actually September)". I am happy to have updates, but I am sad that things are moving so slowly, even though that is what everyone predicted. Won was obviously overly ambitious with his time-frame. Still, I'll be glad if I can have a Smartwatch by the end of the summer. This user's account has been deleted. Maybe it's a language translation thing, but when I read in update 14 "the first set of watches that were due to be shipped by July will now ship by August", I didn't read that as "at the end of August" :( They posted some pics on their Facebook page earlier today. Hello Won, any progress on the August delivery? Would it be possible to get weekly updates? Maybe let your backers know how things are going and what to expect? Thanks. Que paso ¿ @Won: SURVEYS!!!!… PHOTOS???… UPDATES!!!!… Speak up please. Hi Won, just checking to see how production is going. Are we still a go for August? Is the Android optimization underway? Isn't that a purely software exercise that can be done in parallel with the hardware development? Did we ever get a survey? Post early June stated it was being prepared. Hoping to see some form of actual updates of production and solid eta. thanks Update 14 says "the first set of watches that were due to be shipped by July will now ship by August". Which gives another 3 1/2 weeks until they ship. So, one assumes that the OS optimisation process is going really well, and that production is gearing up. Certification shouldn't take long, according to the comments from Won. The new website is due to be updated before the end of June. And yet, there have been no meaningful updates, videos, pictures, anything... Owner of other so called smart watches, I was looking for a stylish watch with some bluetooth connection. At this point with other other brand watches being announced. Vaches will end (at least for me) to be a nice watch to keep in a drawer. No news, no updates, no videos... Will I receive a Chinese alibaba watch? At this point, and receiving the watch in September (even if sended in august), I will have other superior an good looking watches ( geak, sony2, etc...). It was a nice try Mr. Won, but it will arrive to late. So.. Where are we on the timeline in terms of production? +1 Any pictures of the production? Any pictures of the production? Would it be possible to upgrade from the black aluminum watch to the silver aluminum watch (now that they will be released on a similar timeframe)? Christian Is that on kickstarters? Geak watch, looks nice and android 4.x Well that will be mine, even with a 330$ price tag. Vachen starts to look like a wannabe. And in September, maybe a I've " could have been". Two weeks ago, there was a schedule of production, and everything looked promising. Three days ago, we were told "We are doing best to follow our schedule." Today we're told that the July shipments will be a month late. At what point did you know that you were going to miss the deadline? If you are still designing the watches (update 13), what impact is that having on shipment date? This user's account has been deleted. As long as we get updates ill be okay. Are we on track for July shipments? Come on guys, I'm sure Won has good reasons and full hands for not answering to our comments. It would be nice though. I know that we have the p.bble as a bad example for production and delivery, but vachen did not broke any promise YET. It will be June for another 2 weeks now, so maybe the website will be done tomorrow or maybe on the 29th of June. If that's the case, it will be on time. @Won, we are just excited to get the smart watch and don't want to be dissapointed by this as other are of p.bble. We want to see if there was some progress. WON RHEE on June 5 - We are estimating that the finalization of the website will be done by July. Pledge level $1 - your name will be on the VACHEN smartwatch website as a backer. Estimated delivery: Jun 2013 So it looks like even the easiest pledge to fulfill will be late. This user's account has been deleted. @Won: From your "Thank You" mail: "We will continue to update our progress, and keep the communication channels open to our backers." Just for your reminder… No communication and no updates???? Zzzzzzz....? @Won: Surveys????… Updates?????… Video????… Photos????… All Backers are waiting… Update please.. Don't make Vachen becomes the next P*bbl* that the creator did not live up to the backers' expectations, i.e. focusing more on the pre-order website rather than complete all the KS backers first.. Just my 2 cents.. Would really like to see what happend in the last 14 days? Update? @Won: Any updates? Please share photos / videos of optimization, progress etc.… As well when are you planing to roll out surveys? Great update Won. Please do keep us in the loop about the timeline and the updates. After the optimization of the software/hardware some video clips would be nice. Good luck! @Arnd : I see. At first I thought all of the project that has been successfully funded will send out their survey right away, as my first backed project did (this is only my 2nd backed project, though).. Hahaha.. Thanks for the info.. This user's account has been deleted. Agreed with what Arnd Jurczyk and Bogdan Angheluta said. Please inform us about your progress on Vachen, as we're in the dark right now. I am new to KS, but does it takes this long for us to receive the survey? I am really glad the project got funded. I hope that you guys can find the perfect ballance between battery life and processor power in order to make this watch both professional (not laggy or with freezes) and useful. As Arnd Jurczyk said, it would be great if you could keep us in the loop and let us know what is happening with VACHEN right now. This user's account has been deleted. How i can read Russians sms or Russian calls name on VACHEN?thank you @ KuTuB-The Great Indian: One thing is the color screen vs the black and white liquid paper or lcd screen. The one you are looking at reminds me of the pebble from a little while ago. KUDOS!!! I can't wait to get this new watch, it is going to be so much more fun then the ones that are out there right now congrats all.. now wishing KS will process this as quick as possible for Won Rhee.. Congrats to all backers and Won... What a ride!!! Congrats WON RHEE! What a fun ride so far. I was thinking silver but that's an extra MONTH!! @derek, the aluminum watch is lighter in weight than the other three versions. Hope this helps. BLACK OR SILVER? @andy I have the titanium citizen watch and I love it! But I prefer a square face. The buttons on the metal watch look more flimsy than the one on the aluminum watch. Titanium, cause its just cool to say you have a titanium watch. OK Someone please help me decide! Should I back the aluminum or the metal frame?! @Andy Thanks....Because of some recent doubtful comments, i was confused and removed my pledge...But...still inside my heart...something was missing....dont want to miss this great project and i don;t want to miss my vachen....again i am back... @Won....Rhee... Dont mistake me.. @KuTuB I can't come up of a major advantage. There are significant differences but whether those differences can become a major advantage is probably very personal. There are certainly hardware differences that on the surface seem exciting, but they have along development timeline to get those pieces integrated. It is the first Smartwatch here that doesn't use Android. In my experience eveytime we use a new environment it has new goodness as well as new badness. So ends up mostly as different and costly as we have to support another set of development tools. Despite the rollercoaster ride which has been this Kickstater campaign, it looks very much now like we should make it. Can anybody compare and tell me what is the major advantage with the following SMart Watch <url>"effort" to market their product. I've travelled around Asia (both personal and for work), so I fully understand the language barrier and time difference effect. It is clear that they did not do homework prior to the ks campaign. Had this project been in the design section, there would have been a lot more interest. Pebble was my first experience with ks. I got my watch last month, almost a year after pledging (orig shipping date was sept 2012). The sad fact is that most ks projects are late. This I can understand. As an early adopter, it is normal that the product is not perfect. Ks is not a store. I pledge my $$$ to support a project that I think has potential. This forum had too much negative energy, so I decided to give it a little help. Are there things that I don't like about the vachen? Sure, to me, it's a bit too chunky and I really want better water resistance. It is hot and humid here in hk so I give my pebble a rinse under the tap each day to get rid of the sweat. Bottom line is that I want to support this company because I see great potential. Yes, they have much room for improvement (too many engineers, not enough marketing/project mgmt type). At the end, I can accept some slippage (say to sept). Even with a later delivery date, they will still be ahead of agent (which I also pledged) and hopefully any iwatch/galaxy watch. That's my 2cents. Since being one of the very first backers of this project ive over these days looked at this project with alot of keenness, my constant efforts of getting these developers to open up to us backers has been an absolute nightmare. After all that has happened in the last few days has made me question whether this is a company that really can handle business ventures. The slow rate of replies to comments is shocking, the 5K pledges going on and off shocks me. That theres only 441 backers for a smartwatch which has so much potential shocks me, the fact that after all this they do not have a video that can show the basic functions in action which qualifies this watch as a smart watch shocks me. This is not how business is done atleast from the projects ive witnessed on kickstarter. The final prototype not being made and the time frame for it to be tested is just beyond me. I do regret to say this and it saddens me that it wholly comes down to the developers, id rather back a project i am totally satisfied with than take a risk and hope that it all turns out ok, even if it does it might not be up to the standard i had hoped for this watch. So thankyou to all the backers who supported some of my concerns. Goodluck to everyone, ill be backing out. Im sure theyll be other smartwatches we are yet to see. All the best guys. How about just simply making a good faith effort to contact those that pledged multiples and ask them to correct the mistake? I have seen other projects make good faith efforts to correct errors and Kickstarter acted leniently. We are nearing the end of this project. I cannot see anything better to do than what has recently been done and let this ride. Just my 2c @Dragen, those rules apply to Product Design as well. "Product Design and Hardware projects can only offer one reward per pledge. Offering multiple quantities can imply that rewards are shrink-wrapped and ready to ship when they’re not. With some projects, we'll make exceptions for what we consider sensible sets — things like salt and pepper shakers, notebooks, building blocks, etc." @Derek, I had the same question. I would think that anybody who pledged additional amounts should revise their pledge (using the blue "Manage Your Pledge" on the right). But I would also expect the company to make whole any backers who missed the memo, either in the form of a refund or product. It seems that most other projects that get away with offering multiples by doing so on the QT. It appears that in this case, it was the clear and detailed explanation of ordering multiples, and possibly the discounted prices, that raised red flags (and if that's true, it's a damn shame that Kickstarter punishes projects that DON'T try to be sneaky). My point is that Vachen cannot promise multiple rewards per Kickstarter policy, so you shouldn't expect them. But once the fund is over, Won Rhee is a private citizen, and can give out watches to anybody he likes. I would hope that he recognizes that his backers made commitments based on circumstances that have changed. It isn't his fault that they changed, but profiting from it would be a gross violation of trust. How about moving project to Product Design? I'm wondering about all the people who didn't receive the message that we cant do multiples? @Dragon It is not relevant whether or not you see anything wrong with the offer. Kickstarter does and will sanction and remove pledges as they see fit to enforce their rules. Yes, I have seen this in other projects [and have taken advantage of it]. Bottom line: If you put it in writing in the project you run the risk of getting busted. I feared it would happen here too. I appreciate your efforts though in trying to get this project pushed through. As of now I don't see any sanctions...just the request to not do the multiples. Perhaps the good faith effort of the creator in the recent update will suffice for the remaining 43 hours. Offering a second item seems to only apply to hardware technology projects - if this one was listed under fashion instead you'd be OK (search for watch and there is a watch project doing this as a normal pledge level!) I can't understand the rules, and think it's not right, but some get away with it! This user's account has been deleted. I have been on this site for some time and have seen this kind of offering before. Moreover, when sending the surveys after the funding is done, there is a box that should allow backers to purchase additional units, if they want. So I do not understand how this is a breach of any website policy. Each pledge level says $ XXX+ . This + means one can pledge more and it is up to the backer and the project creator to decide how this extra amount will be awarded, if at all. Many projects complained about not being able to offer multiple units but it is easily fixed by doubling the pledge amount. Even this was not an issue before. My only guess is that a "flag" word like "discount" was used in communication with backers and that set KS off... I don't think there is anything wrong with this offer... @Won, That's great, thank you for the information. As a backer, I can't overstate the importance of open communication, and I appreciate your efforts to answer our questions. I'm looking forward to seeing the watch in action in June, and especially to having one on my wrist in July. This user's account has been deleted. @Won, Thanks for the quick response. I had several questions, and you answered only the first one. I can appreciate that there may be a language barrier, and I am sure you are busy at the moment. However, since we are not going to see the watch in action, it is all the more important to be clear in your communications. More information is a necessity at this point in the process. So to clarify, the watches we receive will notify the wearer (via bluetooth) of incoming phone calls, text messages, and emails. Will the display include caller ID? Will it display names or images from our Contacts stored on the phone? Will the full text of the text messages be displayed on screen, or will it only display the sender's information? Will email notifications include subject lines or preview body text? Will it be possible to control what information is displayed on screen? In what stage of development is the software? Are you beta testing, or are you still in pre-planning? Also, I am reposting the questions from my previous post, because I do not feel confident that there will be support for early adopters. 3. What differentiates the "Kickstarter" model from a standard production model? What plans do you have for the 5th iteration? What functionality, if any, is being left out of the Kickstarter model? 4. Will the software be compatible between iterations? Will new apps be backwards compatible with the Kickstarter model? 5. Is there currently any indication that you will not be able to meet the delivery schedule (July for the earliest delivery models)? How long does the manufacturing and certification process take? Kickstarter funding ends May 30th. You can't do a video of the features for another month, and then you plan to put the features into the watch at the end of June. Then you go into production, and still plan to ship in July? If you look at the problems Pebble have with shipping to Germany, this isn't an easy process - German customs want to see a manual in German, European certification, battery information etc. If the watch has WiFi, doesn't that require certification? I'm not convinced about being able to get everything done to ship in time, to be honest. Particularly if the smart features are still being developed. @Won Please answer @Benjamin's questions. Additionally please reiterate your answer to me in on eo fo the updates regarding the applications that will be on the watch at the time of shipping. I'm currently re-evaluating my pledge. A clear understanding of the watch functionality and feature set as anticipated at the time of shipping is essential. At this point your watch has not even demonstrated the functionality of the WIMM android smart watch of a year or two ago. Can't be a part of a company saying one thing and doing another. You promised an optimized video and now say its not worth your time but its worth our money! @Won, Thank you for your update. Yes you should have been more clear about being able to demonstrate the functionality of the Vachen. I am very disappointed that we will not see the Vachen functioning as a Smart Watch prior to the end of the funding campaign. Additionally, your post raises several concerns: 1. Specifically, what features do you expect the Smart Watch to have out of the box? What features will require additional software? 2. Does the software for Smart Watch functionality exist? Or do you expect to develop it after the funding has ended? Are you relying on 3rd party developers to create those features for you after the watches have shipped, to be downloaded via the Vachen App website? 3. What differentiates the "Kickstarter" model from a standard production model? What plans do you have for the 5th iteration? What functionality, if any, is being left out of the Kickstarter model? 4. Will the software be compatible between iterations? Will new apps be backwards compatible with the Kickstarter model? 5. Is there currently any indication that you will not be able to meet the delivery schedule (July for the earliest delivery models)? As a backer and someone who has provided you with support and marketing ideas at your greatest time of need, I will be scaling down the level of my support. However, I expect you to show us a fully functional watch before deployment and shipping in July. If you simply disappear after this campaign, I am sure that I can find ways of getting my money back through Amazon as well as make sure that your company does not enjoy the privilege of doing business in the US online or through retail stores. Thank you. "As for the video of the watch receiving calls and texts, that probably won't be ready until the end of June." So by the end of the Kickstarter campaign, the only thing that we have seen the watch can do is to change face?? @Won, I am concerned that the Smart features of the watch have not been developed or tested yet, and won't be until after the funding period is over. I am not interested in a watch that changes faces. I backed this project because I want a Smart Watch with a color screen. If you have not yet developed those features, how can we be assured that you will be able to delivered the promised product on schedule? You had previously promised to show those features. What has changed? Video is a must if you want people to keep true to their pledge! WON, a video update at this point is a MUST. Remember, we are the ones who got you to this point, with our unreserved support and advice you have been able to get over $24K in less than 48 hours and save this project from disaster. I am sure many will agree that we can pull back our pledges just as easily. Not technically difficult to show watch in action? Then take a camera and make a short video of what the watch, in the form you have it now, does. I am sorry but I have a feeling that multiple people communicate under your name and that can clearly be seen in the variation of written English over time and related to how " difficult" the question is. This gives me a feeling. Of trying to communicate with someone from an online Chinese knock-off android sale shop and not a serious company. There is still time, and I hope you are a reasonable person....ACT NOW! You have managed to get pledgers back and they have pledged even more and project is now funded. You have stated to show us a new optimized video of the watch and now have backed out of that. You are going to have pledgers back out if you can't keep your word and show us a video. This user's account has been deleted. Hi.. Won Rhee.. There is a Sea of Funding for "AGENT: The World's Smartest Watch". Can you compare with Vachen....????They are showing excellent Video how it works....Please show us the real working kickstarter edition watch.....time is running out....please dont be slient.... I agree with Kelvin... Won see if you can get the video of watch functioning... Don't show the prototype but actual "Kickstarter Edition" watch.. How it looks, how it works... Packaging etc. whatever is possible. hi Won Rhee, you posted earlier "Now we are doing system optimization for VACHEN smartwatch. After finish optimization, we will add the apps to the VACHEN smartwatch. We are doing our best now. Please wait for posting the video." So now that the project is funded this video not happening? Can we trust you can deliver what was promised? if you say "not technically difficult to show the our smartwatch to communicate with smartphone." The video is not just to show us what the watch can do but to enforce our trust and faith in the project. can you please upload a video of vachen receiving calls and messages... Without seeing a video of the watch in action, I don't know what I'm pledging for. I can't justify spending this much money on something that I don't know what it does. Best of luck with the project, but without seeing what it can do, I've cut my pledge to $1. @Benjamin, I understand the reasoning behind the first 3 $5K pledges, they turned into "regular" pledges, but there is another $5K pledge that popped up overnight for the " meet and greet" offer. Check it out. I asked for clarification on that one as losing that pledge would spell disaster for the funding effort. Still waiting for that video.... @Dragan, regarding the $5k backers, Won addressed that already. Each of them are known to the developers, and are intending to be distributors. They are real pledges. I suspect (reading between the lines) that the company was not willing to offer "preferred distributor" status to anyone who pledged $5,000 on Kickstarter, which would explain why they removed that pledge level. However, Won has stated that those backers have not withdrawn their pledge (and the numbers support him in that) so there is no reason to believe that they would withdraw at the last second. I'm glad to see we have reached the goal, and hope that everything is still on schedule for a July shipment. I also would very much like to see at least a beta demo of the Vachen doing something that qualifies as "Smart" before the end of the funding period. @Christian Dimension: 44 mm X 52 mm X 14 mm (1.732 inch X 2.047 inch X 0.551 inch) It is in the FAQ listed as the titanium case. The only titanium case they make is the round model. I suppose it was already asked and but what's the size of the titanium round watch.? @Sudeep, The question about Windows phone 8 was already adressed, the answer was august. The answer for BB10 was also adressed; no plans yet. The reason i know is because i had the same questions. Congratulations won, most often the last hurdles are the most challenging. I am sure you would appreciate more funding. Please update the video and hopefully we will see more funds flowing in. Also please let people know if and when the other mobile os would be supported like BlackBerry 10 and win8. WON, did you decide on the offer I suggested earlier, as well as some kind of demonstration video for the backers who are holding out from contributing more. Please act fast, as people can withdraw their pledges just as easy as they have made them. Just because the project is at $102K now doesn't mean things can't turn around against you again. Please keep up the communication open, especially in the final hours.. GOOD AT LAST NOW THE VIDEO................ I don't know who the 5K backer may be but I sincerely hope it is a real pledge, maybe Won can give us some clarification. Nevertheless, congratulations for now and I hope the pledges keep coming!!! And there you have it they finally reached their goal congrats!!! I too may withdraw my pledge. I want to see a more recent video where the product seems to function smoother. Like someone else mentioned, this is more of a Beta product. I was hoping for a more functioning final product. I am better off paying a little extra for the watch when it hits the shelves, warrantied and tested. WON, Just as with an add on watch, you can send an update saying that all existing backers qualify for a discount on the second generation Vachen watch. Things seem to be moving well, however, I will agree with BAN when it comes to video of a fully functional watch. I don't know what you guys have so far, but to post something within the next 24 hours would be crucial, so please make every effort to put something together and post it on KickStarter. Thank you for listening... 대박 나세요!! 훌륭한 아이디어 입니다 오늘 backer가 되었습니다 얼렁 내 손목을 장식 할 날이 기대 됩니다 good turn around, won i am hoping for the video with the optimisations, and video, calls messages, notifications etc....from what i gather the final product wont be ready before the kickstater project ends....unfortunately on that basis ill cancel my pledge because i dontknow what ill be pledging for....this project should have started when all the finalising had been done and a final prototype made. Its too much risk for all this money so ill be backing agent for now....hope to hear for future plans from you guys, ill wait till the last day if any videos are posted and it might change my mind... 6500/100=65 YES ITS ONLY 65 PEOPLE TO UPGRDAE OR BACK. WE WILL COME THRU..aND TO WON RHEE ........AALL PEOPLE ARE WONDERFUL ....NEVER FORGET THEM Won, I am curious to how shipping will work. If one of the watches ordered are scheduled for a july delievery and the other is scheduled for august. How would you ship? That is going to be a huge impact when released. I can't wait to see it and see everything the watch can do. Are we going to be able to see a video of an email/text message and also a call? Keep up all the communication and updates. Y'all have done an awesome turn around keep it up and this will get success!!! The home stretch....I feel the extra offer did the trick... Won, did you think of my other suggestion? That would probably secure a guaranteed customer base for a second generation product...and right around Christmas holidays... In the meantime, let's go backers!!! I'm back in! I am literally praying for this project to be successful. I have 100% confident on vachen. I really want this watch ASAP. I did not only come back, but have upgraded my pledge as well. Something tells me this product will be very good, especially for the deal we are getting for 2 watches. I sincerely hope that people will realize what a wonderful gift this watch can be and pledge extra to get this product fully funded. With the communication we had in the past 24 hours, this project would have been funded a long time ago. Unfortunately, we are now in a situation to wait until the last minute to see whether this is a success. I hope everybody learned a lesson from this experience, especially Won and Vachen. Good luck to all and I am keeping my fingers crossed for this project!!! We need just 60 people now to buy a watch to make this project a Kickstarter success!!! Please spread the word and everyone, tell your friends, tell your family, tell your gardener, tell your ex, or buy a second one yourself! Go go go! Hi! I just upgraded my pledge to add an extra watch. Will the extra one also come with the 2 straps & charging cradle? The extra watch will be a gift for my father's birthday. Thanks! Almost $3K extra just from existing backers upgrading their pledges. Let's hope backers from the rest of the world do their part overnight....Also, if there are any Agent backers out there, you may want to mention that now you can get 2 smart watches for just over $300 with Vachen ;-) WON, please come through on the discount offer as well and this is pretty awesome deal!!! As well for $184 - Square Aluminum Watch (White) is there. I am now confused about the metal watch.. It says "dark brown" on the latest update, yet doesn't resemble any shade of brown in the pictures. From the pictures it looks like a silver color (which I thought I pledged for)..can someone clarify please? If the watch uses Bluetooth to speak to the phone does that mean the phone can still use Bluetooth for car kits etc? For all of you about to change your pledge to get the second watch, please go to "manage my pledge" and then, based on the prices outlined in the latest update, enter the new dollar amount and confirm your payment method. Sorry if redundant, but it seems like there is some confusion on the update thread...Thank you. It seems like the extra watch offer is working...May I suggest another "deal" you could offer that would take this campaign a step further? How about an exclusive, backer only, 20% discount on the second generation Vachen watches? This will show to your backers that you believe in your product beyond this first production batch. A code that could be used on your website or other retail portal should do the trick. I have changed mine to brown+sarvoski=359 $ Seems to be working, pledges have increased :) Hey Won, I want to do anything to help out! You mentioned earlier that english being your second language seems to have a bit of an issue with your ability to communicate. I am fluent in both Korean and English. If you have any questions about translations or anything feel free to leave me a message I will always be able to reply within the hour. I'm loving the constant updates but time is running out hope you guys make it! Perfect..... Better late then never... Back in game. Gosh I had no idea about backerkit. @ won.... i guess we need a fresh update now. and like dragan said those kind of reward levels would go good with people. All the best won. Then when you send out your Kickstarter survey you ask how people want to spend their additional pledges. This would then tie up with the prices you list for each additional watch type. Hi Won, Ideally what you should do is release an update stating how much funds to add to your existing pledge for each second watch type. So if I wanted a second Aluminium watch i'd add $140 to my pledge. If I wanted a second metal watch I'd add $150 etc. List the prices for each additional watch in the update. WON, Make several options like this one, particularly one where one can combine men's and women's watch in the same order. I understand you have several price tiers for different types of watches, but try to do something like this: Add extra aluminum face watch to existing pledge : X dollars Add extra round face watch to existing pledge : Y dollars Add women's Swarowski watch to existing pledge: Z dollars Make prices uniform for each add-on across pledge levels, and make it public through an official update to backers so everyone who pledges gets it in the email. It is a three day holiday weekend in the US so people will check their emails and will be more likely to contribute extra. Time is of the essence, put something comprehensive together and send an update. WON, Whatever you want to do do it NOW and FAST!!! Just make sure to do it through an official update!!! Finally some movement, thankgod....if onlu you guys were abit afster at all this, im holding my pledge on the basis that i will soon see a video, with calls incoming and outgoing, messages, notifications, whatsapp capability and other apps...also the user interface, how it handles, it still seems abit slow so ill see what your final versions like, please make sure you cover all aspects in the video. These are the last few days so it all matters. WON, not at all, it is like I am pledging for two warches of the same kind so, naturally, I have to double the amount. Except, here you write an official update telling your current backers that they can add an extra watch of any kind (or whatever package you put together) for an extra dollar amount added to their pledge. There is also a pretty neat software/website called BackerKit that can compile all this after the funding is done and help with ordering multiple units. There you can set rules independently of Kickstarter (like, $300 pledge = 2 watches, etc.). Please ACT FAST!!!! Won- So if funding fails when will we be able to purchase a Vachen via retail (from the web or in stores) and what will the new cost be? For those of you wondering about Vachen's ability to deliver on time, I asked Won about the time line by email and here was his response: "The funding from Kickstarter will be used for this 4th pilot product and certification process. To finish our products in July, we have placed orders for parts in February. Once our first sample is completed in June, we will submit it for FCC and EC certification, and we believe the certification would be ready by July. We're currently working on the following: development tool, and a platform for combined watch face store and app store...we should have the apps ready by latter half of June. The watch face design is not completely tied to the hardware development, and therefore is progressing concurrently. We are working hard on taking necessary steps to ship in July and August." So the target is still to deliver by July/August. It's just that their time line and action plan had not been well communicated before. My understanding is the hardware is only undergoing final tweaks and they are working on the software side. With a target delivery date of July/Aug, I would say the Vachen watch has a good chance of making it to the market before Apple or Samsung does. I have been a backer for vachen for quite some time now and have been silent all this while. Looking at how the pledges have been going I hope that it reaches the pledged amount. I believe you guys should have got definitely more than the pledge amount. But now unfortunately I am praying that u get at least the pledged amount. I know kick starter does not allow you to add more watches as it is against their policy but as drag an has said if we could add more to the pledged amount for a second watch then maybe just maybe we could get more funding. Hoping to see this go through. Also post a video of a call coming on to the watch, a message being read on the watch. This is important for people to see. Hoping you can deliver. OK, now you guys are slowly but surely telling the whole story in a manner that could have helped people see the "big picture". You are based in Korea, as I previously stated and you have time difference and a language barrier working against you in terms of quickly communicating with backers. Your only hope now is to offer discount on the second watch. Each backer has an option to add money to their pledge so even though Kickstarter does not allow this as a "new pledge" you CAN send out an update saying "if you add $130 to your original pledge level, you get a second watch". This IS legal and after funded you will know EXACTLY how much each backer pledged. After you send out surveys you simply count number of,say $300 pledges and people who pledged at this level will chose two watches they want either in the comments section or just by putting 2 in the amount box. Please consider this again. It will work. Thank you.. I don't get it-- this watch blows the other current options away... Why is it falling short while others explode? Won Great video... But late. Still holding my pledge... Hoping a miracle turns it into reality cause I really liked the concept and do need this watch. "Every android developer can develop the apps and put the app into the VACHEN smartwatch with some authorization." Who does it need authorization from? If I write an app for the watch, how do I get it onto it? Looking on Kicktraq, the project lost $1500 in backing today, which is pretty awful when it's so close to the end. Won, Still holding my pledge too... But now you have stir the campaign for the last time. Give video of end product, show pictures of menu and interface, share as much information as possible. 420 backers are still with you... Hold them and get new.... Just 4 days left... DO IT. Still holding out hope for successful funding but with the current strategic retreat to the rear, it looks less likely. Good luck Won Rhee. I am hoping to be one of your backers. Interesting to see $15K in pledges withdrawn and the total pledge amount still at 87K. Is Kickstarter slow to update? In any case, thanks for confirming my previous suspicion that you are raising money for a not fully functional prototype and not a product we can rely on. If you want beta testers, product for that purpose is provided for FREE and not at 80% of full retail price. I am out. Even the $5000 backers dropped out, and there is to many unanswered question and concerns that you are not answering from us. If your still working on a prototype and don't even have a full fledged retail model to show all features you shouldn't be on here wasting people's time. I AM OUT!

This user's account has been deleted. +1 @ matthew The closer we get to the end of the project, the more worried I'm becoming. Every update, picture, and comment seems to be about the different watch faces - it's all been about the form rather than the functionality. Five days ago in a comment on an update, Won said "We will continue to showcase our new watch faces, as well as show features of our smart watch to attract additional backers.". Since then, we've heard / seen no more of the features. Reading the project page mentions an SDK for watch faces, but there is nothing about designing your own apps. Questions I think need answering: - can you build your own apps? If so, how? If not, are we relying on Vachen to do everything? - for connecting to email, does the watch / Vachen app need to know my password, or does it just pick it up from the phone? If the Vachen app needs my password, do you support Gmail two factor authentication? - can you disable watch face changing? The videos all showing when you tap the screen, but if I accidentally press the screen, I don't want it to change. - given the list of changes coming next year (see Baselworld update), are we not being asked to back a prototype, with the real thing (better battery, different charger, water proof etc) coming next year? I'm really, really looking for a reason not to cancel my pledge - I don't want to back out, but there's not enough information here to make a decision to continue. Look at the Agent project, and the creator is on there 24 hours, responding to questions, asking for opinions, and giving feedback. All we get from Vachen is faces and straps. Disappointed. OK, for every new pledge, one is lost. Pledge levels are NOT moving up. Come on Won, the ball is on your side of the court. Give us a deal and let's get this funded!!! I would even double my pledge to get a black and silver aluminum watch. yea, I would tack on 130 or so to get a second watch. If a 1/3 of us did that then we could easily bump up to the goal. Agree! I would pledge more for a discounted 2nd watch! I agree. WON, thank you for following up. Still, the fact that you came so far with funding and yet are so far away given that the pledge amount has actually decreased from yesterday should motivate you to at least offer something extra in order to rack in the elusive 13K you need to get this funded. As echoed by some other users, I would suggest a two watch combo at a discounted prince. This would probably motivate some portion of your backers to add to their pledge. You really only need about 80 more pledges to make it, so PLEASE consider this. If there are other backers who agree with my proposal, please chime in here so Won understands that this will indeed have impact on funding. Thank you. Im also still backing this project, for me it's an ideal combo of practical use and fashion. Good luck with the final stage! Won, I am not canceling my pledge. I am still backing this project. This user's account has been deleted. WON, I think you may have good engineers and designers but your marketing could use a MAJOR boost. You need money? Then SELL your product to backers by bombarding us with FACTS and DEMOS. What has been shown looks very amateurish and creates more doubt than support. If you have only a concept that needs development then say it: I have a shell that needs some major polishing and development. Your lack of "show and tell" clearly shows that either your product is FAR from "launch ready" or you just harbor some irrational fears about certain functions of your product being copied by competitors. But, you know what? I bet you another smart watch with color screen and fancy looking casing will pop up here by the end if the summer, they get funded, you lose first mover advantage, you're out. Will it look good on you to say " I have failed to fund with Kickstarter"? Do you even care? great, woohooo...i give up lol he just seems to have selective answering...WON the last time, look below, scroll down with your mouse and please address our concerns regarding videos, publicity, apps, watch in action....this is officially my last comment, i cant take this, illl be backing out soon regardless, i see no prospects unfortunately, i hate to think what its gona be like..Good Luck with the project everyone @Won, that makes sense. It is good to know that they are serious pledges, and not some people screwing around. It's also nice to know that you're out there promoting the Kickstarter drive. Any plans for photos or videos of the Vachen displaying notifications or other functionality? We're in the home stretch, but there is still time to have a surge of pledges, if backers start to see what this baby can do. @Dragen, it seems the $5k is for "preferred" distributor status, the details of which have been presumably negotiated directly. Distribution rights are worth what people are willing to pay for them, and every deal is going to be different. Preferred status and collaborative input could easily be worth that much, based on anticipated sales. I'm glad the distributors are contributing through Kickstarter, because it means we are that much closer to the goal. I assume that was the purpose of the pledge level. Thanks for the clarification, Won. However, I still think that $5K for distribution rights just does not make much sense. Anyone here with business background who can confirm this? Are there 2 more companies that you are in negotiations with? And why is it important that they contribute through Kickstarter? These deals are usually carried out "offline". How about addressing some other questions? Thank you. Aaaaand, that's how you lose backers. I am not worried about whether I will miss out on other opportunities, I am worried that I will spend a good chunk of change on a product that will be a) useless past the preloaded content or even worse b) never delivered to me at all... I don't know if the $15k pledges are from real backers or cruel jokesters, my worry is that they are from.... well fill in the gap yourself, but in this scenario, this whole thing looks pretty "scammy". Will give it another 24 hours for clarification, then I am out... Sorry guys, I am out. To many unanswered questions then the strange $15k pledge. I am backing Agent now, They answer every question and they have a huge community already. That translates to developers. With only 426 backers on Vachen and a proprietary closed store I do not expect very many working apps besides pretty watch faces. I wanted this very much but now I feel like many of you do, fearful so I am out. Good luck guys! @Melchy, that seems like a cruel thing to do, especially for a project so close to the goal. Hopefully its a genuine pledge, but its not that unusual on Kickstarter for people to play with high level pledges and then withdraw them at the last minute. I am worried why someone would contribute $5K if that would get them a watch and early access to technology/distribution. I would expect at least some heavy customization and input in decision making/ seat in the strategy meetings. And these pledges showing this late in the game... Sorry but something is fishy.... I'm curious about what the $5,000 corporate sponsorship level is, exactly. The description is rather vague. Glad to see Vachen getting some "corporate sponsorship" at the $5k level. :) Today's seen a massive surge in interest - at least $13k that I've seen. This morning, kicktraq had the project trending towards $97k and missing the goal, four hours later it's trending towards 108% of the total. Hi Won , I think by making an iphone app to support this would get more backers. Won, Thank you for clarifying the same. May I please ask what about rest of the questions? Any update on when are you updating us on them. It's just 7 days left... Company is based in Korea, Won is based in California it says right on the side :) I believe Won is based in Korea so he probably cannot answer question right away like the N.Y. guys... In any case, the lack of demonstration of this watch in action is concerning. I am sure most of the backers did figure out this is a Korean company based in Seoul. Yup more videos of funtionality is almost mandatory at this phase of the project. We want to see what the production model or something close to it is capable of. Other smart watch projects have done this and it makes it easy for people to compare devices. Without any extensive videos or pictures of the actual watch people are starting to move on to other more interesting projects that show all the cool things their device can do. I want this to happen so bad this watch has so much more capability than others I've seen! I agree with Ban... @Won the only one person who break it or make it is YOU... Speak Up... Respect the backers supporting your project... We care that's why we are pursuing... Else even you can see there is no limitation to choices in market. Please SPEAK. also tv remote functions, wifi functions, these are the things that backers are looking for...uses, pros, cons to others....honestly i look at the responses the agent has made to its backers comment, every few minutes and it shocks me, thats how it should have been done here...i have a feeling its gona be close or nowhere close At max447, totally agree with you, the lack of advertisement does this watch injustice, WON come on, post more pictures of the watch for god sake, been asking for ages, this needs publicity, why people should back this than others, show us the call feature, messages, notifications, future possibilities, play videos...man it just gets me annoyed, we get one sentence answers from WON, seriosly new watchfaces dont entice people, i think weve seen enough, we need to see the features...it in action, the final prototype, whats the future...some apps or im afraid this project isnt going to make it max477 is right, so far we have seen some really great watch deign and cool watch faces. But if the word "smart watch" is in the title people need to see it in action. I will admit I am on the fence now, I like the look of the Vachen but I want the capability of the Agent. I want to be able to read my text, email, control my music from my iPhone, count my steps in a day, keep track of my calendar and give me a great user interface that is not slow or clunky. The Pebble, The Martian, The cookoo, and the MetaWatch all have a dedicated phone apps that is a way to communicate with the phone, plus sync and download apps to the watch. The Vachen will not, that is a bit scary to me. Your example of a roulette game scares me even more. Its like a cheep knock off. I want to see it in action. i can photoshop cool watch faces BUT give me some evidence that it does more than that. You can see by the huge numbers that the Pebble and now Agent are getting that people want a smart phone companion. Vachen can be all of that but with the style of a cartier watch. Good luck Vachen! @WON, I really hope you are taking our suggestions seriously. I am sure you could start large scale production with the help of a big company backing you up but that would do nothing in terms of value created for you. Vachen would probably get absorbed by a big watch producer for a very modest sum of money. As an entrepreneur, I hope you do realize that in order to build value for your company you need to work independently as long as possible and build value by introducing more disruptive solutions. Kickstarter campaign would probably provide you with a good amount of cash to produce a couple of thousand watches and have them in user hands WAY before the competition. I hope this campaign is not for marketing purposes only, in which case it has failed. I hope you do realize how close to the goal you are and what implications getting this funding may have to your business. If I had $25k of disposable income I would pledge it in a heartbeat to get you across the finish line, although I would not take watches in return :-) Please consider further "deals" for the existing backers and act fast!!!! Good luck. Won, you need to show people what differentiates the Vachen watch from the competition. For me the main differentiating factors are: 1) it has a color (65k!) screen, 2) with a 240x240 resolution, 3) with WIFI capability. Show us some pictures of the Vachen watch displaying some photos (anything colorful, babies, pets, etc.). This is something that neither the pebble nor the agent watch is capable of doing. Yes, it may be gimmicky, but I'm sure there are people out there who would want to have personal photo as a watch face. Post some pictures of the Vachen watch showing off its 65k colors. Give some concrete uses for the wifi capability. Post the videos you mentioned earlier. You have a good product. Keep the updates coming. Thanks. A little late, but you'd probably get more interest by calling it a "smart watch" rather than a "smartwatch". If you search Kickstarter for "watch" this project doesn't come back in the results :-( @ ETHAN I TOO SUPPORT AN EXTRA ATTRACTION AND ANOTHER 24000/100 = NEEDED 240 BACKERS WE HAVE 413 TILL NOW EVEN IF 50% PLEDGE WE ARE THRU @Ethan, I second that idea! An extra watch for an extra discount would be great! Or, one male one female Swarovski watch combo for $300...I would upgrade immediately! Think about it, please!!! Or if we could get a bundle (2 watches) for $100 more. With the current backers it may help reach the goal. I think the Vachen looks way better than the agent and has a lot more potential. I would gladly up my pledge by $50 if there was another option such as earlier shipment?? Also keep in mind that the Agent doesn't ship until Dec... that's half a year from now and by then trust me another smart watch kickstarter will start and it will be outdated. That is why I am going with Vachen. It has beautiful style and colored face which I value over water resistance and wireless charging. I'm excited to see what you guys have to offer in the future! There is a huge difference between Agent and Vachen video. Agent focuses on user benefits while Vachen is more technology oriented. I can see first case to be more attractive to Kickstarter backers. Maybe something in the message to change rapidly to show the side functions and user benefits. Hoping hard that Vachen will make it ! @Won, No problem. Hopefully I haven't turned people away from backing this project. @Dragan, I wasn't the first to point to the Agent as an alternative, but I checked it out thinking I might rather back that and decided that there really isn't any comparison. They are different products serving different functions. I tried to remain objective, but to me the Vachen is exactly what I want it to be. I really want my Vachen (especially at the Kickstarter price!) and I want like-minded people to recognize how great it is. Having said that, it isn't going to be everything to everyone. Some people really want something waterproof, and don't care if their watchface is smaller, black and white, or looks nice with a suit. We've only got 8 days to hit that goal, so I thought a quick reference comparing the two might help people poop or get off the pot. I want to be wearing my Vachen this summer. Uh-oh, it seems the total pledge amount is decreasing...I hope the comparison bit did not do a disservice to Vachen by pointing people to a different product that just started their Kickstarter campaign... And it seems they are hitting their goal already. C'mon, people, have faith and wait this one out! I am sure Vachen will be a better overall product and it would be a shame to miss out on it now!!! @Won, thanks for the info about the case. Good to know that it is replaceable, even if we can't do it at home. Quick Pros/Cons comparison to the Agent, for those on the fence (@Ban): Screen: Vachen- Full color 1.54" 240 x 240 TFT LCD Screen; Agent- B&W 1.28" 128x128 Memory Display with Intelligent Backlight Battery Life (YMMV): Vachen- 48 hours; Agent- 7 days Charging: Vachen- Charged with Standard Micro-USB; Agent- Wireless (but proprietary) Qi charger Style: Vachen- Many styles to choose from; Agent- One watch style, black band with choice of accent color. Water resistance: Vachen- Splash/Rain ok, but has a charging slot; Agent- No charging slot, water resistance is intended by actual performance tbd. Price is similar, if you don't already have a Qi charger. Essentially, they fulfill different functions. I'm backing Vachen because I don't need water resistance, and I don't mind charging at night. It has the color screen with some great watchfaces, and the style I prefer. Found on net... <url>#more-452 I am backing this because I believe this will prove to be a better product then any other fancy gimmick. @Won 8 days to go... Push it. Update all. Almost there... It stresses me out that we are so close, yet so far right now :-/ Still some of us are waiting on a video, of notifications, calls, messages...vibration motion etc...what kinds of apps will be supported by this watch, are 3rd party apps installable, can other software program developers help the future of this watch with apps....so many other watches are coming now, i just hope the hype doesnt die on this...theres another smartwatch project just launched called agent so im in 2 minds..can unfortunately only back 1 I tipped Gizmodo as well. I tipped Engadget to try and get a story posted. We still need roughly 100 backers. Incase if we dont have VACHEN service center in countries like INDIA, DUBAI-United Arab Emirates... Then what is the solution for this.. I believe it will only connect to your iPhone via bluetooth and access your notifications. Vachen is promoting having a V- Store on the watch itself where you can buy and sell watch faces, apps that only run on the watch, and updates. So the watch works for iOS but if an iPhone user cannot use the watch app then how much of the experience would we be missing out on? It seems one of the main draws is to be able to download and buy additional watch faces..if I understand this correctly then an iPhone user will not be able to do any of that? Not to be critical, but I don't think more watch faces are going to entice more backers. I don't want to discourage you from making more, because all of them look great so far. It's just that there are already some very cool watchfaces, and if people aren't backing now, that isn't going to change their minds. Are the metal cases interchangeable? Because selling extra cases would certainly bring in some last minute funding. Could u confirm that well wont be charged extra customs like the some pebble users got charged here in the UK, could you please make sure when u send these watches you can label them as gift... Still don't know if it has been mentioned if the Vachen app will be available for the Apple store? No mention of the Kickstarter campaign on the Vachen website? Seems like one place you could definitely get a mention. You're going to need a lot of backers over the next 9 days in order to receive $25,000+ and get this project funded - time to put yourself out there! This user's account has been deleted. Looking forward to the Vachen watch. I've been wearing my pebble watch now every day for the past month and i absolutely love it. My main areas of disappointment with the Pebble are 1) the screen is only black and white (no gray scale, each pixel is either black or white) and 2) the resolution is only 144x168 (not a friendly resolution for round watch faces). My wish list for the Vachen (v2) would be to have better water resistance (I live in a very hot and humid climate), but hopefully without needing to resort to using a proprietary charging cable like the pebble. Is the ladies early backer more than the men's because of the Swarovski crystals? If so that's kind of unfair because I don't need bling if there is a smooth metal frame.... Maybe that's why there is less attraction to the kickstarter because the pledges are towards more male than female? Add me to the list of people that would up my pledge for a second frame. I have pledged for the metal but would love the silver or black aluminum as well. I would gladly backup, a black and silver aluminium Vachen watches. I wouldn't have pledged if I didn't think this project could reach it's goal. It's a great concept. @Ethan, Great idea! I would pick silver and black. If getting new backers is an issue to meet the goal, is there a way for you to add something for the current backers if they up their pledge? Something like a package of both aluminum and metal for an additional amount? @cres Yes! Hi. Does this products support for iOS(iPhone)? Please submit the watch on more websites like <url>"smart" functions of the watch. By this I mean how emails, sms, phone calls and appointments look. The watch faces are amazing, however, this is still a smart watch and I think more people would pledge if you can promote these functions more. We need more publicity for this watch. Articles published in popular technology/fashion/product design websites will help a great deal. Let us know how we can help. Is there anyway I can suggest for this project to be a Kickstarter staff pick? This product is unique enough to merit being a Staff Pick in my opinion. Thank You WON RHEE for being so informative and forthright. It gives me confidence that you stand behind your product and you listen to your backers. I cant wait to sport my watch! @BAN Thanks for answering. Hope this will push through! Hi Won, I just thought of a quasi-brilliant idea that shouldn't be too difficult. Kickstarter Backers tend to like special editions. How about a Kickstarter Backer watch face preloaded on the watches for Backers? Thanks for listening @Brian Choi: I'm a backer and owner of the MetaWatch Strata (<url>"smarter" than the MetaWatch, because Vachen runs on android while MetaWatch runs on its own custom OS? Hope this helps. You said range is around 10 meters. If I leave the maximum distance and walk back into range distance will all the backed up messages come to the watch at once? @BAN on May 03 Won Rhee wrote this in the coments" If a backer wants a Silver Aluminum case VACHEN smartwatch, it is possible for the backer to receive it but the delivery will be delayed to Aug. 2013." @ Nelson, where does it say shiping delayed till august for aluminum silver version, i might not go for that then myself lol Hi Won, will you be supporting the what'sapp messaging application with these watch? When will the SDK be available? I would love to start designing watch faces, I can see a Tag Monaco inspired face, a Panerai inspired fave and a military face. Not to mention modern Digital readout with weather and date. If I am correct there will be a Vachen App store in the watch where all of these faces and apps would be available. Will there also be an Android and iPhone app? Possibly a way to connect and sync info between phone and watch. Lastly I am torn between the all aluminum silver or the coated black version. It looks like the all silver version will be delayed to Aug. 2013 so I am sticking to black. Also the watch IS water-resistant, but NOT waterproof. How many watch faces are pre-loaded on the Smartwatch and do additional watch faces cost $$?? Also, on the chronograph style faces do all hands function? Its amazing after WONs updates on the watch and him answering to questions, the pledges within a day have reached 6000 dollars, amazing how crucial such things are...keep it up WON, Check progress on <url>#chart-exp-trend Nicely done WOn, love the updates with the video, thanku...was wondering do you have any plans with the metal case and the red buttons..that would be cool too... Also Won how about a video demonstrating a call, sms and notifications on the vachen, also could you plzz answer the customs issue bothering some of us with international postage...a few posts down we have mentioned it Will the watches have any type of WATERPROOFING? @ Sheryl, all the early specials include international shipping, so the 169 also includes international shipping.... Nicely done WOn, love the updates with the video, thanku...was wondering do you have any plans with the metal case and the red buttons..that would be cool too This may have already been answered but is there any plan to bring apps to the apple store? Hi just pledged the $169, and i am currently in Bahrain and would want to ship the item here. Just tell me if im right, that if it is an early backer theres no shipping fees needed or do i need to select the $179 in which the delivery fee is included in the package. Thanks. More power! HOPE THIS PROJECT WILL BE SUCCESSFUL!! I don't see any issues with this project getting fully funded in 18 days. Yes, they will not raise millions like some other similar projects but then again, those projects burned their backers pretty badly with poor execution. Let's wait it out, get our watches and with product IN HAND write raving reviews and make this viral. All they need is ~40K in 18 days...no problem, I say... Allow us to help! Give us updates! Like ive been saying in the last few posts, just seems a lack of publicity and enthusiasm with this project...its got so much potential...really hope it picks up, we can only 330 backers can only do so much, at the end comes down to the developers. I agree with the comments on publicity, You are only going to get so far with just the kick starter community. You are over 50% but you need more buzz. How can we help? An Engadget or tech crunch post will get attention of the kind of people that will want this. The Pebble looks boring and not for watch aficionados, the I'M Watch is similar but awful design. Vachen has a shot if done right, people want smart watches and wearable tech and if you are going to compete with the future Apple iWatch i think having a modern clean user interface and ease of use will be important. It should complement the great look of the watch. Lets get the word out! This user's account has been deleted. hi Mr. Won, how can we choose the colour of aluminium case? and what kind of strap do we get? hey Won could you post another video with the silver aluminum and red accents...like you did with the metal one. And can you please answer our questions below regarding customs and how the colors shall be chosen and what colors in fact are available with the aluminum pledge, so far i gather black and silver with red accents. This project needs more PR, still 45k$ to go, and the days goes so fast now @ Won, Thanks for the update on the watchfaces, they look impressive! Also, could it be programmed to show my facebook messages for example? I do lots of extreme sports and always get worried when I am doing sports with my phone in my pocket. This would be a great way to just leave my phone in my backpack somewhere and only go to check my phone when I see that I have a new message or something. Now, if the notifications are through bluetooth how far is the range on the bluetooth would you say? I cant wait for this, it looks sophisticated and modern. I hope the UI gets a facelift, I wonder how hard it would be to make your own watch face? I have many watches and I love how each watch has unique details. I would like to play around with carbon fiber, wood grain and mother of perl textures to get an upscale look or a bold digital display. I am concerned about battery life, will there be a built in warning vibration when your charge goes down to 20%? iPhone does that and its a good reminder to charge it up. I wind most of my watches in winders at night so treating this watch the same way is a good idea. Thanks! Yeh i agree with customs is based on a country but you can totally control whether a product will get customs or not...Juan and Mathew are correct in that way...the developer can make sure that its backers dont get charged as alot of kickstarter projects do, by declaring them as gift or making sure that if any customs still do arise they are paid by the developer....its very expensive for international backers when you are hit with customs because developers do a bad job in either notifying there backers and defeats the whole purpose. Im hoping Won can guarantee this wouldnt happen to us just like Smart herb Garden, guaranteed it, there awesome assured all EU backers, and the products they are sending are technically food products, even more hassle. @Juan that's a great idea!! Hopefully Vachen will label them for outside US shipping!! An easy way to Fix the UK custom cost is just to send the Packages labeled as "GIFT" that way they won't be stuck and wont have to pay the extra 20%... Other Projects solve it this way and it works... And technically it's properly done since we aren't really purchasing the watches, but pledging and receiving it as a thank you for helping No I'm just a pledger... and in DK its 25%+custom handling cost which is like 25$ @B4Me - exactly, Vachen could do something with the shipping firm to take care of customs, as many projects on Kickstarter do. I'm not sure if you work for the project or not, but I was after an explicit yes or no from the project whether the shipping includes customs fees or not. In the UK, that adds an extra 20% to the price, which makes a big difference, particularly at the higher pledge levels Matthew: As I answered before Won cant really do anything about the customs when going into EU, thats just how the system is.... only thing he could do is shipping with UPS or Fedex, which have their own customs, so it wont get stuck in your local custom facilities ... Hi Won - did you answer BAN's question about customs fees? One project I backed included the customs fees in the shipping costs, but I'm wary that when the watch arrives, I'll suddenly get hit with another 20% charge for customs because you're shipping from outside the EU. oh and won is there any possibility to get red accents with the metal case 179 dollar pledge, that would be cool Thankyou Won, it really means alot, i just wanted to know the product before i spend so much money, you have mentioned the silver aluminum in the 169 dollar pledge with red accents, so ill go for that, for some reason both me and Andrew thought it was a black case wit that level, so im guessing we can choose the colors in a survey at the end...think you should mention this on homepage as i can imagine new backers arent being sure with such options. Thankyou again for your response, looking forward to updates now i guess I think this is a brilliant product and have ordered the ladies' model as a present for my mother on her birthday - and therefore really hope it reaches the $100,000 goal! I just wonder if your campaign would be more successful if you named the device something other than a "smartwatch," as that word contains the word "****," and many people might find this word offensive? Even if this sounds silly to me and you, it might be stopping some people from backing this otherwise amazing and innovative project? Just a thought. Also does the watch have a mirophone or speaker Won u forget to answer our questions on color which me and another backer are asking for the 3rd time (few posts below), other questions came to my mind, How does this Vatch differ in terms of readability while in sunlight, the biggest problem with such watches is glare, has this been improved on the Vachen so as to read messages clearly while in sunlight. Can you also please answer mine and andrews questions a few posts down. Thanku....I am abit concerned, it has been a week with this project and no updates have been made, some questions are being left out.....im worried this is another case of a project where we support but no eagerness or enthusiasm about the project is brought forward. I mean whats happening with you guys for time being, any future plans, how did the technology show go, any pictures, any more videos with the watch in action with multiple scenarios, calls etc, any reviews from people...out of most projects this one seems to be dead unless we ask the questions lol I hope you will answer the color queries regarding the red accents and metal case or aluminium silver and red accents...like in the pictures. What kind of colors with straps are we going to get. Whats your plans after this project in terms publicity cuz ive never heard of Vachen or any organisations you might be affliated with in the future...Sorry so many questions Thanks Won for the quick reaction. @Frank, because, in case of android, i want to be the consumer, not the product. And in case of Apple, because i think different ;) Jurgen I have to ask...Why would you buy a gorgeous watch like this and then get a BlackBerry or a Windows phone? Just pledged the metal one, but left with a question. Will it be compatible with Windows Phone 8 or Blackberry BB10, just in case i buy a new phone. Thanks in advance and good luck developing! FAQ: Water Resistant It is water resistant - Suitable for everyday use. Splash/rain resistant. NOT suitable for showering, bathing, swimming, snorkeling, water related work and fishing. Does the watch have any kind of waterproofing? Hi. Are you thinking of titanium square face? Won what about color questions weve asked earlier @WON Thank you for your reply. I look forward to building some watch faces. "BAN about 12 hours ago Won i also have a question, im on the 179 metal case early backer special, now since worldwide shipping is included," isnt it saying that 169 is INCLUDING shipping outside US ? And BAN, customs WILL hit you.. its not the shipper but the recievers problem due to the way the borders works I am with BAN on the silver aluminum case with the red accent on the edge. Just like in the movie clip. Won i also have a question, im on the 179 metal case early backer special, now since worldwide shipping is included, im abit worried whether ill be hit by customs fee here in the UK, pebble promised all fees will be paid but their UK backers got hit by customs charges because pebble didnt pay it, could you plzz confirm whether well have not have the same problems once these are shipped abroad to us I think you should add another pledge for the silver aluminum case with a later delivery date. Backers will be interested in that Well if kickstarter dont reply, you can always send us a survey at end and we can choose which color to have from the ones given...also what about having the red tinge on the buttons panel for the metal case... @WON 1] Will the app store be available upon watch release? 2] What are your thoughts on pricing of Apps? Pricing of updates to Apps? 3] Will watch faces cost additional money? 4] I know CPU speed, how much RAM will the watch have? Roughly how many watch faces will the watch handle? Thank you WON could you answer my and Andrew Figueroa questions a few posts down, regarding having a silver aluminium case with red buttons, like the picture on your home page, or the possibility of having the metal case with red buttons....it would be amazing if they were offered Okay, would a custom remote app, comply? Do you maybe have a sketch of the store policy ready now? Is there no titanium square option? And there wont be any restrictions on which apps I can upload ? How will it be with running my own apps on the device ? And what about root access, will that be possible ? Which are the 2 different Straps that the Watch comes with? (Material and Color)? I think a little more functionality like changing songs on your iphones music player, ignoring calls would be great.. One important think to try and get would be some type of WATER PROOFING, that would make it great, specially since you use the watch every where even on rain. Also regarding multiple pledges, although Kickstarters is agains it, Campaigns always make it work by asking people to double or triple their pledges depending on how many watches they want, and then you take care of that later on: 2x169= ... 3x169=... etc... I'm curious about the metal one as in the video it looks quite darker than shown in the picture, would love to see some videos of people wearing these under some good lighting so we know exactly how they would look like and can chose accordingly. I agree with @Ryan. UI appears laggy and not smooth. I'm assuming you are still working on optimization and code. Which one is on the menu user interface video? I did not find a match! Thanks!! Hi Won Rhee thanks for the latest video. Can you create video where the watch recieves a txt message or phone call? Also the interface still seems to be a bit laggy. Do you plan on optimizing the interface to more responsive? Hi Won, does the watch support multi language, like Chinese, Japanese? Yup totally with you on that one, i love that too, really want it but couldnt find an option either, i think when won is free next week cuz hes been busy at a convention hell clear all these things up...colors and stuff, i hope there's also an option with the metal case and red indents, that would look cool too, but if were given an option of silver with red indents ill go with that, right now im sticking with metal case, i dont know black aluminum with red or black indents doesn't do it for me, too plain lol People im tryng to share this project with are already asking me questions on colors and shipping, cuz pledges just dont state the exact technical stuff, i think won would add such queries to the FAQ section once there team has time, its crucial for blowing away the target goal @Ban Thank you for the heads up. I love the silver aluminum one with red accents in the video and hope that we can get that specific one! @ Andrew, i think you would able to choose the silver in a survey that might be sent at the end. I totally agree WON should edit these changes on his plaedges as there very confusing, niether does it say about shipping in the early birds even though it is included, WON i highly recommend posting such details on the home page so people dont get confused with shipping and what colors are offered in the 169 and 178 pledge levels BJ what i do when i come across kickstarter campaigns that have strict policies and rather not take the risk since kickstarter can be a little fishy sometimes is to make 2 kickstarter accounts. You can make 2 kickstarter accounts but when u choose a pledge you can link it to the same amazon account, theres no way actual linkage but when you go to pay you can pay using the same amazon account, hope that helps... Thanks again for answers (I'm still missing weight of lady model though ;-) Concerning kickstarter guidelines: not so long ago I have pledged for two pens here: <url>"metal watch" made from? What straps will be provided with the watch? Leather, fabric, metal? Will we get a choice? Is there any chance a square faced titanium watch could be offered? Thanks. Never mind won. I figured it out. I didn't look hard enough! Won, I'm looking at the number of backers and the amount you have listed for your total pledge and the math doesn't seem to add up. $19,673 of $100,000. With the $169 pledge it states 428 of 500. Now if you have that many people buying that pledge you should have around 72k not 19k. I am only asking because I really like this project and want it to succeed. I'm just a little confused about the numbers. I have several questions: - how do I pledge for two different watches? - what material do you use in front - is it scratch proof (gorilla glass)? - what is the weight of each model? could you also answer my and ryans questions aswell in regards to performance i definately think WON should add these small details cuz it is very confusing, especially since the homepage doesnt mention it either No Melchy, i wasnt sure myself, but then was told, all the earlies backer sepecial include both domestic and international shipping which was awesome in a way. he mentioned it a few posts down. Just a quick question, do we need to add $10 to the $169 pledge for international delivery. Its not clear from the description. Also a question on scratch resistance, knocks, will the screen break easily..almost every watch ive owned has somehow had a knock against something... Good question Ryan, does seem abit on the slow side...may be there just prototypes, and the originals faster Hello are you working on optimizing the interface responsiveness for launch? From your initial videos there seems to be a lot of lag switching between menu settings Hello, can you tell me the dimensions of the watch? question: will the watch will connect to an Apple Iphone5 ? Awesome Won, exactly what i was hoping for, May be you could mention this on the homepage, im definately sure, non backers would be very much interested in this information and increase the pledges so we can reach our goal fairly quickly....Also i heard your say on the NFC model, my concern is, after we recieve our watch in the month of July, i just dont want to be in a situation where you release a version 2 or 3 months later. If that is the case i will wait for the second version since i have an inkling that will kickass lol Im in no hurry so do you have a date of when this will happen or whether it would happen, if im going to spend this much money i might aswell wait for the second version rather than be in the disappointment of having the first version for 4 to 5 months and then realising a better one has come out. Thankyou again for your replies, greatly appreciated, very happy now lol Thankyou your post has definitely assured me a little bit, i understand you guys have been busy but no mention of it was made to us so some of us got abit worried, Could you just lastly touch on the shipping questions some of us have in regards to each pledge, the early bird which ive voted and almost everyone might have says nothing about local or internationally shipping. Im guessing it is included, well i hope it is. Im also trying to compare this to the pebble, do you have a list of why people should back this project rather than the pebble functions it has to offer. I understand its not a competition but it would be nice to see where the differences lie internally according to your team. Whenever you guys are free its ok with me, thankyou again for the response. So the Wifi capability is purely for emergencies and stuff, could apk be developed in future which allow this wifi capability to be used and search the web online etc. Thanks for the update WON..glad to see this wasn't just a launch and forget project. Can you address the possible addition of NFC? Especially when creator(s) and backer know, the beginning and the end are the most crucial phases of a successful campaign here on kickstarter. Amazed... I'm glad someone said this James, and am glad it was exactly what i was thinking for the past few hours, at first i was like ok, they just need time, they'll answer soon but im totally gobsmacked by no response whatsoever, not even an indication....im really shocked, if this keeps up im just going to cancel my pledge...YOU HAVE A business model, u know it'll work, why aren't you guys replying, WON seriously, this is not how you handle a project that your getting people to back...im amazed really, either they've forgotten this project exists or there just not bothered with what backers think. Shame cuz i really believe this project has potential, i also believe its the lack of communication why this project hasn't skyrocketed as yet. Does anyone else find it odd that the creator(s) for this project have not posted anything? It looks like they have spent a lot of time, effort and money on both the product and presentation, but seems they invest no time or effort sense the actual launch. Maybe they are unaware that the project actually launched. You send to brazil ? Thank you . Exactly my concern too James, i just hope this project doesn't turn out to be another one where all they care about is the money, surely that's exactly what seems to have happened with the most successful project to date, hint pebble, some people are really not happy, so glad didnt go with it but i hope these guys are better...just waiting on the replies now This statement makes me want to wait until v2..."An NFC-mounted model will soon be released making payments possible..."unless they make NFC a stretch goal....hint hint. No idea abt water proof capabilities? What is the use of WI Fi? also would this metal shape be prone to rust and paint coming off...disputing between aluminium or metal, ill wait for your response im really trying to compare this to the pebble, i really held back cuz i knew theyll be better stuff coming out, and glad i didnt go with it, after production and shipping problems they had. just wondering whether this project is it...it looks amazing, love the bigger lcd, plus color, my issues are on water resistance, scratch proof and other stuff thats not been mentioned, plus since its android, its perfect..im trying to find information on you as a company, whether ull stick with what you say...your platform and your goal without compromising value for us backers im on the 179 dollar pledge amazing product guys. have a few questions, whats the purpose of the built n wifi reciever, plus u said nfc capability, i hope when we back this project and its been funded you dont come out with a version 2 other wise i might just wait for a version 2...also what exactly is water resistant, i mean, if its raining hard outside, like it is most days here in the uk, plus alot of humidity in the middle east, i dont want this watch to stop functioning...it is an expensive watch at end of te day, also im early early guy, i hope that includes free overseas shipping as it didnt mention...the pledges are abit confusing... so there are only analog watch faces .. Is it possible to have Digital watch faces.. ? What are the dimensions of the watch..?
