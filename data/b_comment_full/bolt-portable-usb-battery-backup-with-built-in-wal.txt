Hello Backers! We're back on Kickstarter with our latest project. Check it out and let us know your thoughts. We'll be back again with another cool FLUXMOB project in the very near future. Stay tuned! REFYNE - P1: The First Modular Titanium EDC Penlight The P1 is a bold, modular design that reduces the amount you carry by combining two commonly used items, a pen and flashlight, into a single functional and innovative package. Grade 5 Titanium Body Super bright 130 lumen flashlight Magnetic quick release light Removable/Rechargeable 10180 lithium Ion Battery LAMY M22 pen refill Introducing BOLT² We'd like to offer our original and AWESOME backers the chance to be one of the first to back our latest Kickstarter project! As a direct result of your feedback we were able to incorporate the features that you wanted most. We DOUBLED the capacity to 6000mAh and added a SECOND USB port but most importantly, MORE THAN DOUBLED the output to 2.4A. This means that you now have the ability to charge your phones and tablets up to 4x faster than a regular USB port! We were able to do all of this doubling while keeping the size down to LESS THAN DOUBLE our original. The first 400 backers can pledge to receive a BOLT² for only $35! Click the link below and head on over to our kickstarter page now! BOLT² on Kickstarter Backers, We've shipped out almost 1800 BOLTs to over 40 countries in just 5 days! It was a ton of work, but we couldn't be happier to get these awesome little chargers to all of our backers. Again, we can't thank you all enough for making this project a success. We'd like to take the rest of this update to answer some of the common questions we've been getting. My Tracking Number says "NOT FOUND" What's up? When we print out a label the tracking number is generated instantaneously and an email is sent out. This doesn't mean that the package has been received and processed by the post office yet. Give it a couple of business days, and you should see an update. If you have not received a tracking notification yet, please contact us at <email>. My BOLT charges when on the wall, but not when I unplug it. To start charging your device follow these handy steps: 1. Plug your device into BOLT 2. Hold the button down for about 3 seconds 3. The green light should turn on and charging will start We even have a quick video clip we posted on our FB page: How to Start Charging My iPad Says "Not Charging" When BOLT is Plugged In BOLT output is at 1A, so it will perform a slower charge on the iPad. The "Not Charging" message is displayed because the iPad is technically using more power than it's taking in at that time. To charge your iPad simply turn off the screen and the battery will charge. When using a shorter cable (such as our 3-in-1) The message probably won't be displayed, but it's still recommended to turn off the iPad screen to get the most possible charge for your iPad. My Lightning Cable or 3-in-1 Displays a Message on My Phone: "This cable or accessory is not certified…" The message may appear, however, that does not mean the charger is not working. Our lightning cables are not MFi certified, but they do function properly. If this message does appear, continue charging with the steps provided above by holding down the power button for about three seconds until the green indicator light turns on. Also, please feel free to use the cables that originally came with your mobile devices. These cables were included as a bonus and convenience, however you are not required to use the cable that came with your BOLT. My Question wasn't on this list. I have an issue. What Do I Do? Please do not ask support questions on this thread. For the quickest response: Send a direct email to <email> and we'll take care of your issue. Hey everyone, Our shipment has just arrived so we'll begin shipping out everyone's package right away. We couldn't be more excited for you to get these in your hands! Once shipped, you should be receiving a confirmation email with tracking. We have opted to use USPS for both domestic and international since the packages are so light and small. Once you start receiving your BOLTs, we'd love for you to share with us on our Facebook page as well as follow us on Instagram: fluxmob and use hashtag #boltanywhere so we can see all of the cool places around the world you're using BOLT! In the mean time if you have any questions or concerns please feel free to email us directly at <email>. We'd like to thank everyone again for allowing us to make our vision come true. Thank you, Justin and Alan Mass production is currently underway and things are moving along smoothly. BOLTs should be touching down in our warehouse in mid October. As soon as we get confirmation that the shipment is in transit, we'll post another update. For the time being we're organizing our shipping strategy and will be placing our T-shirt orders this week. We've also been working with a photographer and have a couple awesome shots we'd like to share. Backers, We received our second set of samples in all three colors and they are awesome! We're very pleased with the build quality and functionality. After we perform the final testing, we'll give the green light to our manufacturer and they can start mass production. We still need to tweak the graphite coloring slightly, but everything else is great and we're on schedule to ship out in October. It's been a phenomenal experience and we haven't stopped working literally around the clock to get BOLT in your hands. We've been holding nightly tag up meetings with our manufacturer and have also had our team member visit the factory to keep things running smoothly. As always if you have any questions or concerns drop us a line and we will answer you as soon as possible. Pre-orders are still available and if you're already a backer you can simply login to BackerKit and add on additional BOLTs and accessories. Here's a link to our BackerKit: <url>’ve been busy behind the scenes making sure every detail is exactly how we intended. We’re nearly done working on the final mold and PCB design, meaning we’re even closer to production. As soon as we get the final mold in our hands we’ll make the announcement and post pictures so you can see the progress. It looks like everything is right on schedule, BUT we still need your help to reach our stretch goal of $88,000 . If you can help us get there, all of our backers (who have pledged for a BOLT) will receive an international charging kit. This kit will include a US to EU adapter, a US to AUS adapter, a US to UK adapter and an awesome carrying pouch. We will also be offering a universal charging cable as a fourth cable option, which will work with Micro USB, Apple Lightning and Apple 30-pin devices – its pretty much everything you need, all in one!
