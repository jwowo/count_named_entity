Dear backers, 24 hours have gone since we launched the campaign, and we already are 43% funded!! This is amazing. Thank you for your support! (That wasn’t actually a header, but we wanted to put it in big letters). As promised, our Super Early Woodpecker Pledge has just come to an end. So well done on being so quick!! To keep the momentum up, we decided to introduce one last early pledge, which will remain for the next 48 hours. This is day 2 and 3. And then no more extra early pledges. If you selected the €10 Super Early Bird pledge and would like an extra Woodie, just add €12 to your pledge and we will send you an extra one. For all the other pledges (€12 included), just double your amount (or more) and we will send you an extra Woodie (or more). Be a cool early adopter This is also a great opportunity for you to be the cool hunter and share Woodie with your friends, to make sure they get a great deal too! You’ll also be helping us get closer to our goal, so it’s win-win-win . Click on the buttons below to share on Twitter or Facebook. If you’re not sure what to say, how about copying one of these two? Woodie just launched yesterday on Kickstarter, and you’re still in time to get the early bird price. You’re welcome. OR I backed Woodie on Kickstarter, I can’t wait to get my leather &amp; wood cable! You can get your early bird now, it’s great to charge your iPhone on the go. Thank you for your support! We will be back in touch throughout the campaign. The NaturWerk Team
