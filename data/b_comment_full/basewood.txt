This hardcover's production quality blows away other kickstarter books I've gotten at $75 to a $100. At $25 this book is a steal! Hope you sell through quickly and recoup. Beautiful dedicated copy ! I love it, nice job Alec ! Thank you ! My copy came in today! Thanks! This user's account has been deleted. Just received my book in the mail today. It is awesome!!! So pleased I kickstarted this, you need the physical copy to do the story justice! Amazing effort from Alec and all the people involved. Quality updates too. Thanks!!! Got my copy in the mail and it looks gorgeous, thanks for the book and your truly enlightening and comprehensive updates on its making. Book arrived today- looks awesome. Hi Alec, I've been following your well documented process and as a fellow comic book artist, it's been brilliant to see. I got my book today and it looks so well crafted. Looking forward to sitting in a quiet corner and reading it.Thank you. Got my book on Friday and it looks terrific! Hi Alec, I wasn't familiar with your work before I backed your Kickstarter campaign. A friend posted your campaign on his tumblr, and I clicked along. I downloaded the pdf you sent to backers the other day and read it on my iPad, cover to cover, in one sitting. The story is great and the art is incredible. I am really happy with this project, and that is before I even get the physical copy. Anyway, great job. I want to see more. I want to know more about your characters and the world you've created for them here in Basewood. Thanks a ton. Sincerely, Dan Boehl Hi Alec Before I pledged I borrowed the french version from my library to see if I liked the book. I noticed that in that edition a few pages had blank and/or cropped word balloons and I assumed if was a printing error. I took a quick peek at the pdf you just sent us and it's the same thing , they're around page 60. I'M curious as to why you chose to leave the blank spaces on the pages rather then simply not putting any word balloons. Thanks , Luc Woo-hoo! Stoked on this! Congratulations! Looking forward to your updates! I discovered this on my Kickstarter app the other morning and after reading the whole book online (I wanted to stop halfway to keep the ending a surprise but couldn't) I have to back this! It's awesome, and while the e-book PDF is practical for me as an Aussie backer, I think it needs the real book to do it justice! So I've gone for the $25 pledge with shipping. Great work Alec! Hey Alec I'm totally pumped to get a copy of Basewood! What are the odds we could get like a t-shirt with that amazing logo as an add-on or something? This looks really great and interesting, but I have one question. How did Basewood get published in French? I have never read this comic but the art looked amazing and after reading more about it I had to back it. I am really excited to read this. Just saw this and had to become a backer! Looks so good. I backed at the $40 dedication level, so where do I tell you which character for the sketch in the book? Thanks Impressive determination !!! I Just can't believe this it's really awesome :D I love your style! It reminds me of Hans Jurgen Press. Very cool project. This is one of the most inspiring pieces of work ever to be created in the graphic medium. This is the kind of comic/graphic novel I love. It is not an ongoing story that is to be homogenized over the years by an nTH number of writers, lovelessly manufactured month by month year after year. This story is the realization of a young artist's dream that has been meticulously forged page by page and tempered by Alec's whole hearted dedication year after unrelenting year. I love creator owned comics because the work is actually the formation of the artist's vision, unbridled to the trite restrictions of a continuity that is not their own. Basewood however, is more than just a creator owned comic, it is a dream that has been so fully realized that in every line of every panel on every page it still inspires in the reader that, even though the story is now tangible and real, it was born as a dream; a dream so vivid that it was never to be forgotten upon waking. Ive just read the first 3 chapters of phase 7 and its just so enjoyable to read. That part were you got burnt by the wind made me laugh. Cant wait to get this book im going to eventually get them all lol. Peace!! Congratulations, Alec! This is so amazing. There is a disturbing mash-up of the songs "We Are the Champions" and "Baby Got Back(ers)" running through my head right now. Congratulations on blowing up the kickstartersphere! CONGRATS on hitting your goal so quickly, Alec! This is just wonderful. So excited to finally get my paws on this! I know longer think of ZZ Top when I see those long beards. I think Basewood. Good luck, Alec. You are well on your way. Alec, I can't believe you are practically 50% backed! Amazing! Good Luck man. Basewood deserves a great format. Well on the way. Good luck. Looks great. I just read Phase 7 #017, which is all about Weezer's Blue Album. I became an instant fan of Alec's work-- his work is super thoughtful and put me in such a good mood! Can't wait to see Basewood! Go, Alec, Go!!! Off to a fabulous start!
