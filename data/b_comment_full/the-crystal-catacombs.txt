Hi, I see there are only 18 reviews on Steam, and I sincerely doubt any backers here will have bought it there a second time. Any chance of sending us free keys, as many of us will use Steam as our primary game distribution platform? Might help getting more reviews in for the game! Congratulations with getting the game on Steam! (<url>"I'll also be posting daily updates concerning all kinds of fun aspects about the game. DAILY UPDATES!" I get that this wasn't feasible, but not even bi-monthly updates? Any news/updates? :-) Woulden't mind an update Coming from another kickstarter that is a failure and asked for a refund, I'm really hoping this guy isn't doing the same shit cuase I'd hate to ask for a refund on 2 kickstarter projects in a matter of minutes... So Maxwell, bud, please give an update thank you. I just read the update, and I'd like to ask that you talk about what this means for the original backers of the game. If us original backers don't back on indie go-go, what does that mean for our original backing? Will we still get the full game? Or will we only get a partially complete game? The update isn't clear enough. Thanks! Well, seeing you finally came out of hiding, I feel like I should have asked for an update much much much earlier... :-( So you planned to announce "bigger news" on April 7. I'm guessing that was about the BETA? How about an update to tell us what went wrong and/or delayed everything? Any updates??? An update would be nice. Do we have an ETA? Hello, any news on the game? I haven't checked in lately. I don't have facebook. is there a link I can get to it? @Maxwell Heya! I don't do Facebook so I don't have an account. Any updates? Many thanks, looking forward to playing. So it's been quite awhile, I haven't heard anything. The website seems kinda dead. Whats up? Any info on the game? Now we are in the new year, how is Crystal Catacombs coming along? +1 for update - and who won the contest? (In spirit?) Hi guys. Just checking in to see how the game is coming along. We would love to see a new update added! Thanks. :) Thinking about distribution, Steam just announced Greenlight which is a way to get your game onto Steam using the community website. Sounds like it's launching in August but might be a good idea to get ready for it (unless you already some sort of talks in place). Website is here (<url>Â´s go for it! I noticed you mentioned that you'd like to port to XBLA, if possible. It's worth mentioning that Xbox has the XNA Indie Games platform, which is much easier to get into, and get your game on the Xbox platform. I love procedural generation in games! Backing this because I want to see more games that use procedural techniques. We need this game to come alive! Good luck! Can't wait :) Good stuff Maxwell. I can tell you put a lot of work into it. Awesome! Can't wait :) Go Max, Go!!!! Been waiting for this one to come back. Now it's time to get the word out and get this backed. Just wish the Pitch video was more of the game at the start of it. What sold this game to me was the amazing pixel art I hope it funds this time! I made my pledge :)
