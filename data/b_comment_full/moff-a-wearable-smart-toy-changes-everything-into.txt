Anyone have success getting the Moff to work with an Android device? I'm still sitting on a useless item that won't connect to any android phone I've tried to connect to. To back what J Dubrow and Keith Laflam said.... Would love to have an SDK to develop against. Android App would be great, SDK would super great! Any chance you would considering releasing the protocol to the public domain so that we may create our own applications? Great job with the band's. Quick question? I have switched from apple to android any idea if you'll come out with a android app in near future? Recipient has not received. Can you provide tracking number? Still have not received anything can you provide any tracking info please. I HAVE NOT RECEIVED MINE TILL NOW DO YOU HAVE ANY TRACKING INFO I gave up on the install of this. It's sitting in a heap of unused junk. I've done the install according to the video three times on two different devices with different IOS installed. One an iPad 2 another an iPhone 5. The concept is cool, but I have to say the user design is atrocious. Still looking for an android version but I managed to get it working on a gen 2 Ipad. Here is a link to a vid of my kids loving these things. We have been playing for almost an hour straight now...great stuff <url>#1, #3 and #5 are not there can we have it via iOS app update in future? Got mine today, Bangkok, Thailand. Can't test it yet, since it requires 7.1 and I'm still on 7.0.4 (I hate to update). Any special reason why 7.1 is required and not 7.0? Anyway, I'll probably update to 8 soon. Just got mine today. My kids are going to love it. Big note: battery cover is opened CLOCKWISE. The three pins align with holes and then you may need to use something to (gently) pry off cover. When putting the battery in, slide it down into the side contact and make sure it is fully seated before closing the cover. Got it today in Sydney, Australia. Are we able to activate and deactivate some sounds in the next update? I personally don't like an idea of having gun sound. @Magaret Takaki @Johanna Stein: Turn the battery cover clockwise till the 3 metal legs of the battery cover are aligned with the 3 holes. Then flip the device over and tap the battery cover slightly, the cover should drop if it's properly aligned. Also, it's easier to insert strap after straightening it. Got mine today in Quebec, Canada! I will test them as soon as I can Got mine....guess what I'm doing tonight.... I already tried a coin(s). It appears that the cover is stuck. Help! Eagerly anticipating a response. I can't get the battery case open! How do you unscrew it? how do you install the battery????? My Moff just arrived. Wow that's fast for the shipping. Too bad, Android support is only available Dec 2014 or my daughter will be very excited to play with this. Only thing to do now is to check whether the hardware is ok. It's mid Sept now. Any revised shipping date? Congratulations on solving the design and manufacture issues. Really pleased about your meticulous attention to detail and the high standards you have for Moff. I was wondering whether you have started work on an Android version of the App yet, and if not when you think you might get started on building it? Any shipping updates? Any revised ship dates yet? Hi there, you did say in the campaign that Moff would work with Android - how far away is that? Cheers, Mat. @Creator. Oh no. IPhone 4 is not supported. Can you support the well known Android phone instead? @Creator. Can I know which iOS is compatible with? I have an iPhone 4 which I have yet to upgrade to iOS7 due to the battery issue reported. @Mikael Nordgren . LOL iMoff. Android support is a must, otherwise you can rename it to "iMoff". Please provide a firm date when you are supporting Android as you are delaying the delivery by 2 months. @Creator. What do you mean you are not supporting Android when you ship to us? The statement is this comment stated you are going to support Android. <url>
