This whole thing could have been handled so much better than this. Can't remember the last update I got on this project. Even if they turned around and said the project is dead and there is no more money left, i'd be less pissed than I am now. Live and Learn. One thing I will take away from this is no more using kickstarter. No way am I planning on wasting any more of my hard earned on potential projects.

I had a mail conversation with kickstarter. They told me that it is not up to them to do anything about this project. As soon as they transfer the money to the project, they are "out"... :-( So in my opinion, it would be helpful if we could get the names of the people who started this campaign and took our money. Maybe we find someone who lives and works in their country as a lawyer and might be able to fight for our rights. Or maybe we find a journalist who can investigate on this issue and at least help us to get clarity. Any ideas? #EyeKickstarter at Twitter...

I got this message from Kickstarter when I contacted them. “Thanks for following up, and sorry to hear that backing this project has turned into a frustrating experience for you. Kickstarter’s mission is to help support creative freedom and independence. Our site operates on a system of trust – we expect and encourage creators to be honest with their backers about project delays when they arise. While we provide a platform for creators to fund their projects, we don’t step into the actual creative process itself or manage the fulfillment and shipment of rewards. If you haven’t already, it might be helpful to read through our Terms of use, which outlines the responsibilities of backers and creators. We hope that helps to answer your question. Please let us know if we can help with anything else in the meantime. Best, Gary” I encourage everybody to go to the very bottom of the campaign's main page and report this campaign to Kickstarter.

Also, Hillary didn’t win and Epstein didn’t kill himself! This is a shame I demand a full refund Here are the updated terms of use for those who do not know who teach and like to offend instead: <url>’ve failed to live up to the basic obligations of this agreement. To right this, they must make every reasonable effort to find another way of bringing the project to the best possible conclusion for backers. A creator in this position has only remedied the situation and met their obligations to backers if: - they post an update that explains what work has been done, how funds were used, and what prevents them from finishing the project as planned; - they work diligently and in good faith to bring the project to the best possible conclusion in a timeframe that’s communicated to backers; - they’re able to demonstrate that they’ve used funds appropriately and made every reasonable effort to complete the project as promised; - they’ve been honest, and have made no material misrepresentations in their communication to backers; and - they offer to return any remaining funds to backers who have not received their reward (in proportion to the amounts pledged), or else explain how those funds will be used to complete the project in some alternate form. The creator is solely responsible for fulfilling the promises made in their project. If they’re unable to satisfy the terms of this agreement, they may be subject to legal action by backers. I opened a ticket, let's act together for our rights. Me and more than 5,000 bakers are waiting for over than 2,5 years for an iPhone case - Eye (Smartcase for iPhone) and the creators are absolutely unresponsive about the project and more, are trying to rise funds in another crowdfunding platform. I would like your help to get my money back since Kickstarter brought these guys to its platform and even saying it is nos responsible for what happens to the project, it was through Kickstarter Facebook ads that I heard about this case. Hence, the platform act as attracting backers, but in the middle of the journey just "wash your hands of it"? Definitely, no.

I was reading through Kickstarters terms and conditions and they have rules and guidelines that state that any Creator of a Project that is successfully funded has to deliver their product to backers. If they cannot successfully complete production on the product they need to explain why and refund money to the backers. If they cannot refund the money then they need to provide proof of how the money was used and provide an explanation of why a refund cannot be given. Kickstarter also has a rule that states they do not get involved in any disputes or take legal action, and that basically they aren’t at fault and it’s not their problem. Now I am wondering, how can you have rules if they are not governed? Maybe someone with a better understanding can help me out, but it sounds like these rules don’t have to be followed and kickstarter is itself a bit of a scam and really won’t do anything to help...or even care to try. How can it be legal to offer a platform for “kickstarting” but have no repercussions for fake projects/scams? I am a backer and have not received my reward. Please refund.

I demand a full refund for my pledge amount. That's the spirit! Hear, hear! :-) Fuck you Esti. You have ruined crowdfunding for me. I was excited about all the cool stuff I might get, but you assholes screwed me. I was on iPhone 6s when ordered. I’m getting my iPhone 11 today. I hope you burn. That’s the only way I can get my moneys worth now. I still have not received the goods. When can I get it? Is my address wrong? Here ya go <url>’t the CEO anymore he is now the CTO... but has deleted his Twitter, everything else is still there including his YouTube. So KS TOS now state btw we can take legal action against Esti. They (Esti) have not fulfilled their promise and their end of our contract. Does anyone have any idea how to start a class action lawsuit, as well as start a FBI investigation against Esti for foreign embezzlement? Has shipping taken place on September as promised this July? Nope Fuck you guys Did anyone get there money back? Bye bye money another scam that's right ! We need a bigger display! So originally I wanted this to fit an IPhone 6 now we are on the iPhone 11 Pro. Even 5" displays are outdated now with the bezel increases. The question now will be does it fold? Dovete morì male,ladri!!!!e adesso usate google translate!!! Wow, I backed this 3 and half years ago, what am I going to actually do with it if I ever get it.... it has totally put me off crowdfunded projects. Think of all those other projects that I might have been interested in if this crap didn't happen... When are you going to update this broken campaign? Getting tired of chasing ESTI Inc. for any kind of answer on this project. DO YOUR JOB! Unsure if you are engaging in fraud or just incompetent. How do we get a refund or where do we file a complaint UPDATE! IMMEDIATLY! I complained to Kickstarter days ago They don’t answer the emails. Another scam. And Kickstarter don’t do anything. You need to contact them directly for a refund. Unfortunately they aren't replying to emails. So your best option is sending a complaint to Kickstarter. If we get enough complaints I'm sure they'll force a refund Made a complaint to Kickstarter. They aren't following rules. Hopefully I can get a forced refund @FBI fraud Another scam with a crowdfunding project. Not the first and not the last. I will never more spend my money with these stupid scams. First and last time I try Kickstarter !!! 😡 If you go onto “read more about this campaign” in the very bottom it gives you an option to file a complaint. I think I have given this project more than enough time to produce a product. Time to get our money back. 😡 October 1st, no UPDATE, no shipping. September 30th, no UPDATE. Refund me please! 29 September - NO UPDATE. Refund!!! I can’t believe how stupid I was doing this ... How do you get a refund? I don't even have the same phone anymore. It was a good idea, but 2 + years to produce a product is way too long. We havent even received an update since May. That's unacceptable. Oh boy, I can't wait to get an update from you promising to support the iPhone 11! Will you include a little survey for us to fill out if we want to switch to that, so you can take them and immediately delete them forever because it doesn't matter because we'll be right back here next year announcing support for the iPhone 12??? HuaWei mate30 Pro! refund September 26th,no UPDATE. Got an email asking to confirm my pledge and asking for additional payment. When is your product ready for shipment? And why should I pay when there is no commitment to ship any time soon? HELLOOOO!!!!! I want to update to an iPhone 11. Do you support iPhone 11. if not your product will be worthless . 2 years in the making is way too much. Please refund! September 25th, no UPDATE. September 24th,no UPDATE. I get iPhone11 Pro MAX. change EYE to new EYE for 11Pro MAX. When you aren't a con man, report your progress! You're better off contacting the website and forcing a refund. They haven't gotten back to anyone I would like to request a refund on this. Oh and the FBI internet fraud department Just contact the president if you're in the USA. As much as I might not agree with everything. I'm sure he would LOVE to hear how another county scammed the USA out of MILLIONS of dollars. I want to update to an iPhone 11. Do you support iPhone 11. if not your product will be worthless . 2 years in the making is way too much. Please refund! Will the eye smart phone be updated to the new iPhone 11 max pro.. I was hoping to be able to use this case on my iPhone 7 when said rls would have happen original. Now my phone is out dated and would love to have it on my new iPhone 11 max pro Looks like another scam. Hope I’m wrong My smartphone is changed because of slow shipment. My iPhone is changed to the new iPhone 11 Pro MAX. Can you please change it to the correct version. I can’t find to adjust it. My smartphone changed because of slow shipment. My iPhone changes to iPhone11ProMAX. So please let me adapt to it. I'm having trouble sending an iPhoneX version now. 私のスマートフォンは今度iPhone１１pro max になります。あなたが時間がかかっていたのですから対応したものに変更してください。 ALways saying open communication only on <email>. I emailed numerous times, never got a reply. Please answer this question: I upgraded from iPhone 6S to iPhone XR, but no such option to change in the website. Does that mean you are not supporting XR series? What's going on? It's been several months with no update. You've said nothing about any cases for going on 3 months now. No updates about the iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max. I plan on upgrading to the 11 Pro Max. I really like your concept. Mophie doesn't make good cases anymore and this gives everything I could want. Your last update said shipping was to begin this month. I'll give you until October. If nothing comes by then I'll need to contact Kickstarter directly for my refund. It makes me sad that such a great product never made it past the concept stage. Yay.. someone that gets it!! lol INVESTMENT.. not purchase.. there is no such thing as a refund of investment, investment is risk for return.. this time, there was no return. Annoying, but people need to realise kickstarter is not ebay! 私は今、iPhone Xを使用しています。いつになったらこの製品は完成するのですか。 A new iPhone will be announced next week. When will this product be completed? Any updates? Please refund my investment! Please refund my investment! Please refund my investment! Backer number 2284 You ever going to release this case or refund my money you ****? Clearly you are a scam you won’t respond to emails, messages on here, messages to your Facebook, nothing cause you just scam people and run with the money and lie about actually doing any thing. You have showed the same pictures to us years later of things happening that you showed at the start of this campaign. I’ll never use Kickstarter again it’s a joke full of scams like this one. Just in the process of totalling up the cost of “successful” campaigns I’ve put money into across Kickstarter and Indiegogo and I’m expecting to be adding this one to the list soon. It’s a shame but I honestly think these sites are just too risky an investment. I’m hundreds of dollars with nothing to show in some cases. I truly hope this one can pull through as the idea was great and I hope they can speed up the redesign and production so that people haven’t upgraded before receiving their devices. It’s been so long that I’ve upgraded phones. Sharon won’t respond to my inquiry and chat on their site doesn’t work either. I really hope ESTI just doesn’t keep making promises they can’t keep and support gets better. Mesuit case There is a meusuit if you can get one Hi I want mt money back Yes 👍 the surveys are still open look for your backer kit email No not really you can try a charge back but good luck if it comes out which I hope 🙏 it does sell it Hi. I know I'm not the only one, but, since the launch of this campaign, I've changed from phone and, actually, I did quit iPhone for Android. Obviously, should it finalize one day, I'm not that interested in this project anymore. Is there a way out...? I'm pretty psyched if they ship the XS Max next month. ANY BACKER who posts terms of service in the comments section imho meets criteria for violating KS Community standards that state “Don’t be a jerk.” Only a complete selfish jerk posts these unnecessary messages that gum up the comments section making it that much harder to have any meaningful communications with other backers and hopefully the Creator, too. So has anyone else found any comparable products that I could use as this is smelling dead? I have messaged them about the beta testing but they never got back with ne I still very much want the product and can wait for it too but was hoping to sign up to be a tester like in their last update they stated hopefully they ask us I really just want the product been waiting years for one and I can wait a bit longer if I have to Honestly, the whole terms and conditions thing that everyone copies and paste is just something to give them false hope, I agree with you about ESTI lack of communications between backers wanting to switch to a different model for their case or any other concern. But in my case, if it comes out, I would be happy and all, but if it doesn't I wouldn't really be shocked considering it's taken 2+ years and they still didn't have anything for the older devices. I am no longer using the phone I filled out the form for, can I change it? I am now using the iphone 6s. I understand the frustration everyone has with this campaign, and I share it. However, it is a Kickstarter campaign. You didn't buy a phone case. You supported a startup that is trying to produce a phone case. ESTI has clearly been trying to fulfill their campaign commitments, and has posted over 50 updates since it started, including one just last week. I have nothing to do with ESTI and am just as frustrated as anyone, but it's also getting frustrating to see people cite terms of service from 2012 that don't apply to this campaign, or people 'invoking their rights' and posting terms of service (many people multiple times - one person over 40) when those very terms of service only show that ESTI has been fulfilling their commitments as specified in those terms, and even if they end up failing outright, are only required to return unused funds to backers, not full refunds. No doubt ESTI could communicate better with their backers, but at least they've been posting updates, even if they haven't been responsive in the comments or by email (which is how they've asked to be contacted). To ESTI, I would suggest being more responsive. I would set up a web site to manage backer issues, such as through Backerkit, so everyone can update which phone they want the case for, and their current address. To other backers, I would suggest chilling out. If you no longer have a phone supported by this project, or don't want it for any other reason, get one that supports the most recent phone model and sell it to a friend or on ebay. Maybe when they start manufacturing ESTI may have a way to offer a refund in those cases, but they don't have to, and suggesting they do doesn't help. You can't sue them if they make it and ship it to you. There is no penalty in the terms of service for being late. If you're new to Kickstarter, you should know that most campaigns are late. This may be later than most, but the fact that they're still posting updates shows they're still trying, and that's all the terms of service require of them. Those are not the correct terms of service for this campaign, as the terms were changed in 2014.

In all honesty I had actually forgotten this fiasco was still continuing. That is until this morning when I saw the update notification, at this point 2yrs on my anger and disappointment has subsided somewhat and as I chuckled out loud to myself I thought .. Are these guys really still now posting updates. I did the official, “invoking my rights under blah blah” thing several months ago, to no avail from Kickstarter or anyone else, I’m no professional to say where we all stand with this, but to me at this stage, It’s clear that we have all been scammed, I don’t expect to ever receive a working product although it would be nice, then again what phone will I have at that time ..? What I cannot understand is why these guys are still posting updates, maybe to rub salt in the wound or maybe for more notoriety, really I don’t know, but what I can see in one possible future is that this may well be being a crowd funding story to tell future generations of how so many people handed over so much money for a product that never really existed and probably never will .. Welcome people to The modern day “snake oil” Who really needs this product anyway .. ? Surely by now it’s just as cheap, most certainly faster and from previous promo images slimmer and lighter to buy your two phones and put them in some sort of folio case that protects them too. 💡 Anyone wanna crowd fund a case to do this ....?? Doh !!! ... Already done and already purchased. Anyhow rant over, I look forward to future posts. Is anyone started a lawsuit or a class action suit against them for not fulfilling their promise but their est. time over a year ago. invoke my rights under Kickstarter's Terms of Use <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill."

I think that the creator has used made up person names for the campaigns. The only name that we can trust the existance of, is the creator Elimelech Wittow (Google indicates that this is a person in Denver, CO, and that goes well with the currency being US$) because Kickstarter ensures that this is the only person that can get the money from the campaign. Give us our fucking money back you thieves. Joseph Sabri also successfully funded an indiegogo campaign for this device under the name Joseph Savion. Lots of complaints on that site too. Looks like it was a scam from the start. I’d like to get a refund please thank you. Did anybody get a refund yet? Is there any chance that Kickstarter will help? Any information where to find the company physically? Is anybody among the founders who lives in Israel and might have a chance to find these cheaters? Any other suggestions how to get our money back? We demmand frecuent updates. This is my formal request for a refund of my pledge amount.

Please report that the creator is using the excuse of "Updated design" to delay this project. I just want Kickstarter to acknowledge the issue and take some actions . Please Report them and tell everyone you know. Hi. Thanks for this feedback and sorry to hear about that emergency. Hope everything is OK. Now, I must admit that this (almost) two years delay change my interest in the product. I was an iPhone user, but not anymore. What do you suggest? Please reply to my email on crowdox. I just changed to iPhone XR, but it doesn't say anywhere in your campaign that you will be supporting iPhone XR? Let me know asap and thanks in advance! @Esti just stop with the BS. At least be honest and say you don’t plan on shipping. It’s worse to keep lying. If you guys really needed money you should’ve just made a gofundme campaign.

I still have an iPhone 6splus and have not received any updates or the products I have pledged for. You keep stringing people along, telling them your working on latest model. Well I am still waiting for my original order for 6splus. WTF!!!!!!!!!! Maybe a class action lawsuit is in order. i understand your SCAM now, since you cant make what you promise. you wait for new iphone to release and then ask your backers to send more money so your case will be compatible with the new model and your R&D starts all over again. 2 years and still no products. you dont answer emails, you dont answer comments on this page. this is a SCAM... are you run off? What’s the status now to receive it? It’s due now based on you comments I long time without information. When will you ship ? How i can get my money back? It is more than 2 years have past and nothing!.. I wrote email but no one is answering me. And no updates for more that 3 months! U said that u will do it every 2 weeks! Answer our questions please! Pls tell me how can I get my money back.. You let us know when you're ready - may be ill fund you again. But for now I want my money back.. For two years now we have been waiting for the product, and although they say that the emails respond, the real thing is that this is not the case. They are playing with the credibility of the company. For some time now, the fans have asked for the money to be returned, which seems like a scam. I ask you to reply to this email and either send me my cover in a short time of one month or return my money. Otherwise I will report you for fraud.

Or i think we just need to report that this company is SCAM. :( Yeah I’m done. With all crowd funding. There will come a day when these websites shut down after showing the complete lack of customer care. Every failed campaign adds a bunch more dissatisfied customers Please let me know when I can receive my reward. Thanks Yes Hello, I would like to change the model in Apple iPhone XS Max. I ask for confirmation. No answer for my Mail. Does the company still exist? When can I get my stuff? If we don’t get an update in the next few days I will will go on every social media outlet and reach out to influencer about this scam. You promised delivery in April! LOL! I forgot about this for a good 5-6 months and came to check on "status"! Hilarious. What sucks is I hate all of Kickstarter for getting ripped off with this. It has been too long. Please update about the current status. I do not seem to be talking back. I’ve updated my device twice already WTAF? Have u start delivering????????? AAAHHHHH!!!! Loookssss AMaazzinggg ya'lll!!! Can't wait! update????? Another one down the drain yet again. These cheats are becoming too rampant. I have basically sworn off tech campaigns as they seem to have the highest rates of scams and yet KS is doing nothing about it. They've even stopped with the fake project updates now. I was starting to enjoy those. This company stole our money!!!!! We have to sue Kickstarter for this company for lying and stealing our money! 3-Nen-go ni wa, hyōjun de daburu OS sumaho ga tokkuni hatsubai sa rete iru to omou. Hayaku de shikin o kaese! 42/5000 After three years, I think the double OS smartphone has been released a long time ago in the standard. Return the funds quickly! When will I receive the product? This user's account has been deleted. UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If Esti just sent us backers the product unbox therapy recieved, at least we'd have a "working product in hand" by now. Looking at the most likely fake update it seems Tue newest iPhone will get their supposed smart cases next month.... While us original backers will get it the month after, however after all these delays and lack thereof actual customer support I highly doubt this product will come to fruition, it seems most likely our money went and disappeared on us with no chance of actually receiving a product. I doubt by this time that any sort of product will ever be dropped off at out doorstep, and if it does, it'll be a cardboard box marked "smartcase" and a picture showing "insert phone here" Any more update? Update??? Money back? anyone know how to report this developer？ they just fraud for all funder never send product out Well, sure seems like this was a scam from the moment funds were released. I just wrote to the KS admins, thanks for the tip others > Click on campaign, scroll to the bottom and click on "report this campaign" New iPad Air and iPad Mini are come, New iMac is come. New AirPods will be come. Next! New iPhone will be come!! iPhone XS will be gone!!!!! Addendum: also for me anyway I think it is best to forget about the full screen, although it’s nice to have one.. the prototype shown in inbox therapy and everything Apple pro is in a sense what I’m looking for. As this will just be a convenient side device that is an android phone on an iPhone . I don’t think people looking to buy this device needs a full back screen as they already have a front screen that is just as large for anything large.. the aspects that people are looking for it are the non iPhone stuff such as the IR blaster headphone jack etc not another “phone.” In the sense that they need the entire screen. if they wanted full screen android they would have went with any other smartphone (non-iPhone) I was being hopeful As they did have working prototypes showed in Apple pro and unbox therapy. And they had a mock up video which wasn’t exactly received well as the thickness of the case appeared to be the same size of the phone. I personally asked for dimensions and got no response that I know of. Now I ask of you, To 1. at the very least (many will be unhappy) an update 2. Although will make people unhappy just manufacture the prototypes or the “final” ver. That you already have 3 . Give up and offer refunds (yes I know what this entails but this project is overdue) Click on campaign, scroll to the bottom and click on "report this campaign" Let kickstarter know that you are being scammed and that they are still accepting money on another site which they are letting them link to from kickstarter, so I fully hold kickstart liable if they continue to support a scammer. Their policy specifically tells the campaigners that they are responsible for delivery or refunds: <url>サワダ様 日本どころか世界中どこにも出荷されておりません。 というか、製品は完成すらしてませんよ、、、 Hey you, crowd starter team... still waiting for your creative spin on your scam/ fraud or whatever you call it. Tell us what is your new obstacle??? We would not get our hard earned money back but guess you are glad spending it. Death knows no calendar, by the way. Good luck. :D 日本人出資者です。 製品、まだ日本には届いてないですよね？ MediaTek Helio P20? Can we get a SD835 or better, or maybe P70/P90 for the delay? Literally 2 years has passed and still nothing has materialized. I don't want to bash but I mean damn. Also, I would assume Android Pie will be on this. I mean this now has to work for the iPhone 6/6S, iPhone 7/8, iPhone 6+/6S Plus, iPhone 7+/8 Plus, iPhone X/XS, iPhone XR, iPhone XS Max. Hopefully Apple keeps the same design style as the XR, XS and XS Max this year, but by the end of the year that'll be 7 different cases, with a possible 1-3 more, not to mention the different colors. I wish you luck, but we need some feedback! February was gone! Do you produce? we should prepare for mochup of eye for iphone XI At all - please write to Kickstarter Help-Center. Even when they reject any responsibility in their Terms and Conditions it cannot be in their interest to be abused for fraudulent doings. The fact that it is now 19 months past original date of delivery and that there are no more updates doesn´t allow any other interpretation. This user's account has been deleted.

We are in 2019 and we still do not know anything about the product. I want my money. € 151 More interest for two years. The biggest Kickstarter regret I have, this company lies out their ass every year and has still not released any products. At this point, those of us who purchased cases for our phones 2 years ago are never receiving anything we ordered. They want us to purchase their cases for "new" phones, despite still never having released a product, and somehow people keep giving them more money for these make-believe "upgrades". I want my money back as many others have demanded, but I'm not naive enough to believe I'll ever get it back. This company scammed us all. Just stating the obvious but we have all been scammed. It's is clear that they never intended to make this case. As long as they keep providing bogus updates they can get away with it. Unfortunately Kickstarter doesnt care. This is not the first scam on Kickstarter and won't be the last. Please stop telling them you changed your phone. You are not getting this case. You have lost your money and there is probably nothing anyone can do to hold etsi or Kickstarter accountable. They call it a bad investment. For those that don't understand. You will never get this case or your money back WTF happened to this project ? Kickstarter should help us Hello it’s been a long time I placed my order for your product and I don’t see it materialising any more. Please I would like a refund of my money Hello it’s been a long time I placed my order for your product and I don’t see it materialising any more. Please I would like a refund of my money Another update coming or any time soon? Really not impressed with my experiences with Kickstarter so far. Two projects backed and neither appear that they'll ever deliver on their promises. Please prove everyone wrong and get this product out soon. WTF happened to this project ? Kickstarter should help us any updates? It looks like even the bogus updates have stopped. Any update Just stating the obvious but we have all been scammed. It's is clear that they never intended to make this case. As long as they keep providing bogus updates they can get away with it. Unfortunately Kickstarter doesnt care.

The biggest Kickstarter regret I have, this company lies out their ass every year and has still not released any products.

I want my money back as many others have demanded, but I'm not naive enough to believe I'll ever get it back. This company scammed us all. I too am frustrated with delays and company choice to manufacture for newest phones first, rather than what was presented to backers. However, I would still like for the company to complete this project and deliver what is really a pretty nifty case considering the amount of money I donated towards the project. And though it is delayed, at least the company continues work, whereas other kick starters have completely gone non communicative or filed for bankruptcy. Please do continue the work and please do deliver to us as expeditiously as possible. I demand a refund. Seriously every year that there’s some BS delay about how they have to reconfigure everything. Like WTF. I have been waiting for the product for almost 2 years now and it just keeps getting delayed! This is ridiculous. Dear sender, I must inform you that until now didn't receive what I ordered. Please inform me about status of the shipment or send me information and confirmation about money refund if you are not able to deliver my order. Regards, Roman Rajic I just want a refund. Are you still in business? Hi, is it possible to update us on the new design and software status, please. Thanks. This honestly muß be one of, if not THE, worst crowd funding project ever. I ordered it in April 2017 for my 6s plus with a shipping date of August 2017. Now it's one and a half years later, and not only didn't I receive the promised product. They didn't even FINISH it. I'm sorry, but that honestly is fraud. I WANT MY MONEY BACK! I need my money! F*ck this! Well then you are just dumb. Thanks for showing the whole world. Can’t anyone from Israel phone the police with regards to this matter? In my country criminal fraud is punishable by law! At this point in time this phone case is already outdated... we’ve waited close to two years for this product to be “under redesign”? Absolutely ridiculous!

What a cheat firm and all bullshit is been shown.. 1 - the screen of the case.. Earlier updates showed it was a full screen from top to bottom as the cameras are used from that of the iPhone.. And lately the update shows a screen which is so outdated and was used for a smart phone of first introduced almost 10-12 years ago.. 2 - just 1 handset is designed ordered from China, hardware arrived this that bla bla bla bullshit.. On the otherhand. Millions are used enjoying other things.. What a master mind i tell you.. To make millions like this.. Estamos en 2019 y aún no sabemos nada del producto. Quiero mi dinero. 151 €. Más los intereses de dos años. We are in 2019 and we still do not know anything about the product. I want my money. € 151 More interest for two years. No he recibido nada después de dos años. Quiero recibir el producto o la devolución de mi dinero. Looks like our money's gone Everyone else has pretty much said everything there is to say but I just have this to add; this better be some case . sholem aleichem If you select the iPhone Xs Max, how much more can you change it? Existing iPhone 7 plus -> iPhone Xs Max change, I hope to be able to receive the last change questionnaire. Of course, new things about change can be hard. If time permits, thank you. Thank you. I want my money back now and it’s a piss off that they r not making one for iPhone XR and I demand my money back Backer No1,025. Now using iphone XS Max. Still waiting.

What a joke amazing if you look at the delightful timeline for all this you’ll see any iphone that isnt the current iphone will be shipped a month after April(if you even keep with this and not come up with another bs story) so what your saying is screw everyone who doesn’t have the latest and greatest iphone and will have to wait another month after you ship to the newest iphone users? not everyone can afford to upgrade every year or want to upgrade every year. getting to the point where i no longer care if this product will ever exist. :/ shame as it was a really good idea. welp no more backing projects on kickstarter refuse to get screwed again by false hopes and dreams when I backed this project, I had a 6s, then fast forward a year and I went from the 6s to the iphone 7, and then another year, i went from the 7 to the X, i think by the time (IF) it comes through, I'll end up getting the iphone XV. I’m pretty sure that 0 people complained about how thick the case was. More BS I need to change my order to iPhone XR I wonder if this company knows that others have been sued in class-actions from Kickstarter supporters due to these “unforeseen delays”. It might be time... 1-9-2019 8:30am PST. Of course another alibi and more delay on the project. What’s new? Is there any updates on the production and can I get a schedule of the release, please. and i need to change to XS max! Is there any updates on the production and can I get a schedule of the release, please. Okay , do we need to change from iphone 6 to 7 to x to xs .. now x1 Are you still in business? No update for one month! Please say something! HAPPY NEW YEAR! I want EYE for Ⅺ MAX. NO MORE for XS MAX! Hahaha, I feel your frustration! Where is the link to actually change the model I want? The one below does not go where I want it. Shut up, Alex last 5days! Do you prepare for shipping? When are you planning to complete it? Is there no plan for the schedule? Will completion be extended every time a new iPhone comes out? I would like the investor to explain. When will the item arrive? This comment has been removed by Kickstarter.

This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. This is the link to change your phone model and/or any other details :-) <url>’s comment below) Happy holidays same, I also need to change my case version. anyone know how we go about doing that ? No, only everyone else can. You're not allowed! May I change the case to iphone xs max model? Because I have changed my phone! Same it's been a long time since my pledge and i've changed my iphone model, where do I send you my new phone details? May I change the case to iphone xs max model? Because I have changed my phone! If I previously pledged for an eye without cellular connectivity, can I change it to an eye with cellular connectivity? The big delay making our previous choice become meaningless.. I afraid that when it really goes to MP, there will be a new generation of iPhone coming. That really made us frustrated. They won’t. We got shafted. Refund! I am not sure how this product (in case there is one) will work with the new phones which don't have any borders any more. And I am very confused, that comments made by me and others here on Kickstarter seem to have been censored... everyone who want to change size, please search "crowdox" in your email box. you can change EYE for new iphone. I request a refund on this project. Can you contact me please Please contact me. Just switched to big iPhone. realme c2 still cheaper & worthy than this case! iphone 7 plus owner still waiting and you made me disappointed! Delay! As I understand now, your going to first produce a case for the newest iPhone first. Then work backwards. Which means, you are going to service all of your backers after attempting to attract new customers. Most of your backers, including myself, bought into this quite some time ago (March 2017). Would seem to me, that they should be priority. Though, you have no idea what version phone early backers are on. Think you need to add a team to focus on customers now, if you truly are near ready to produce. But, I fear that your customer support will be less then acceptable based on everything else we have seen so far. I truly hope I am wrong. You can still knock this out of the park, but you need world class support. November will go, December will come! ship ship ship!! deadline will come!! Here’s an update I got via email. So basically, it doesn’t matter that we’ve been waiting forever for the models they promised. They’re going to focus on new models first. This is just going to keep going on. 🙄🙄🙄 “We're sorry for this inconvenience. I see that you ordered for iPhone X. X model as well as all other models will be shipped a month after the XS Max. Technical considerations got as to a point we'll be shipping the case for the XS Max before all others. As mentioned, we still plan to ship for all other models. -- Please let me know if you have any other inquiries. Best, Sharon from Esti team.” Will this be compitbles with iPhone 4? I orders before change phone and now give refund becuase no longer have iPhone. Thanks for telling us all. That's made my day. Good for you. Fed up with the delay, please speed up the production and shipping. You never show the both sides of the device in the same sequence. When you turn to the other side of the Eye, you cut the video and show the other side in a new sequence. I suppose it is because you are not able to propose a 2 sides working prototype at the moment. I hope that I am wrong and that you will finish the project successfully soon Thanks for the update dear Creators I need to switch mine from 7 to iPhone xr Here's some advice from a superbacker. If enough people click report this project on the web or Kickstarter app, something will change. Guys stop asking for refunds they dont care and have ignored the request from the begining. be happy that they are still engaged and showing updates. Before sender no Eye, will you send a mail in order to confirm the phone? It has passed so much time that lots of people have changed their phones Refund !!!! Ok, you said "2 weeks"... and now ? What’s up ? I want to believe, but you don’t answer our emails and you are not able to show us a working prototype. Honnestly, I don’t understand why it was so difficult to build this mock-up. I can create something similar with a 3D printer (not the same quality aspect, but faster). Now I would like to see a working prototype with all the abilities you promised. It is just a shit ! From iPhone 6 to 10, it is still no any product come out. Can someone help me? How do I get a refund I want to get a refund REFUND REFUND REFUND REFUND Haha. These guys are riding this fraud for all it’s worth. Every time apple or Bluetooth make a change gives these frauds the opportunity to postpone. So the can continue to collect more “investment” money. Simple and eloquent scam. Keep crying for a refund friends that’s all the joy we’re going to get. What’s the timeline on the original cases? Why is there no update on that? Oh. Because you’re scammers, right, I almost forgot because your mock up video and subsequent snarky update was *so* convincing. 😑 不用等了，到死也看不到这玩意儿的。 每年都会重复同样的话，各种中国假期无法生产，各种原因无法生产，然后又回等到新iPhone发布以后说支持新款，等一等就好了，然后就是各种重复。 送这个软件、这个项目一句话：操你妈逼。 What happened to the Mobot timeline? This is just another large money project where kickstarter and the so-called developers get the money and you are just SUCKERS. Something I predicted a year ago. All you SUCKERS get is a card board MOCK-UP video, congrats. I don't use an iPhone anymore since it was a iPhone 6 when this project was first announced. There is no chance this project is going to delivery their product. Do not go to the Indiegogo page since they are still collecting money for this project: <url>#/backers The product has been in the development for over two years and they still continue to make updates on newer iPhone models, but have yet to deliver the models they were first announced. DO NOT GIVE THEM ANYMORE MONEY! It is a nice interesting idea, but they have yet to produce a working prototype on the first models, unless you are talking about the prototype given to a youtube reviewer. But that version have been released by now. So, I have no faith in this project. Need to recover the money. What do I have to do? Not interested anymore. by far the worst project i have backed on Kickstarter! Are you going to make a case for the Iphone XR? I need two... Asking the same question Asking the same question Asking the same question Asking the same question Asking the same question Asking the same question Found it! As it's been a while, my iPhone 8 is looking kinda old. I know I booked to get the iPhone8 case, but can I update to the newer models? Can't seem to find my BackerKit email and I need to update my address. Anyone got a link handy? You are still stolen our money and just want more time to continue escaping Dear Creators thank you sir the mock up but it looks pretty thick than expected, it's almost like caring two phones There have been 5 other projects I would have backed over the last year, but because of THIS scam, I have not taken the risk. Kickstarter is losing out and so are other, possibly legitimate projects. I will never back anything on Kickstarter again. Cause this project its taking longer than normal I upgrade my Phone from the iPhone 7 Plus to the iPhone xs Max it is possible to change my option to my new phone Just saw your mock-up video and the first thing I see is DAMN THATS THICK. Like unusable thick. Yikes. i just change samsumg s9 + the iphone 7 case not event make it ! they not going to make the case ! we all got scam ! I need refund I need refund I emailed Kickstarter, they sent me a long explanation but basically they said that kickstarter app is a place for us people to fund and help them reach their goal but if they cannot reach their goal, it means that the project will result in unsuccessful project and no money will be refunded. Kickstarter said they will learn from this mistake and prevent something like this to occur in future. NO MONEY WILL BE REFUNDED!!! According to Kickstarter need to change the order as i have a new model. and no update at all.... Next scam called digicase project is live in kick starter Well that’s good news to hear I now have the iPhone XS max how do I update my order I tried to update my order as well and sent two emails. No response. I'm starting to lose hope... If I were to see the Esti guys on the street: Booooooo! Boooooo! Boooooooo! Booooo! Boooooooooooooooooo!!!! Booooo!!! Kiss your money goodbye. Kickstarter is such a crock. Same. There's literally nothing stopping people from just taking money and running. Crowdfunding is such a scam Where’s the design render for XS Max “in 2 days” ? I have still have not received my I can update my order from iPhone 7 plus to the iPhone xs Max??? cause I upgrade my phone to the new iPhone XS Max and need to change it Exactly!! People are actually still funding this and buying it over at indegogo <url>#/backers Literally they are still making money off new suckers. how do I change my order from a iphone 7 to iphone XS ? And by the way, this could be a problem : "While the iPhone X and iPhone XS have identical overall dimensions, a new report suggests that iPhone X cases may have a slightly imperfect fit on the iPhone XS due to very slight changes to the camera bump dimensions." <url>商品が届くのはいつでしょうか？ 至急にご連絡をお願い致します。 I invoke my rights under Kickstarter's Terms or Use: <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill." I demand a full refund for my pledge amount ASAP. So what you’re saying is, that the phone that barely came out (iphone xs max) is going to have a case made faster than the pre existing phones that have been out for a while and that you already should have already finished the designs for and already should have a prototype for (6/6+,6s/6s+,7/7+,8/8+,X). At this point, theres no point in being optimistic, you’re just stalling at this point since you clearly don’t have at least a prototype (even though you had sent a prototype to unbox therapy for them to review it) thanks for the web site. No real information on the site. Looks fake I just assume I’m never getting my smart case, but, my optimistic side wonders why the updates keep coming? If you really are working on this case still can you do us all a favor? Stop trying to recreate the case for every new phone that comes out and just finish what you got then move on to the model. I have the XS Max now please upgrade! I want my smart case So as an early bird contributor; I'm no longer considered early bird (1st to receive products) because I don't have a iphone XS Max? HA HA HA . I call BS. I bet we will still be getting similar email when the iphone 11 is announced. Another update without any proof. Blah blah blah. It’s very frustrating. refund Oh also: 5. In what stage for the software development? I do not think the native android os will support those functions that you mentioned to work with iOS... I try to stay positive as I have written it off from my wait list, but still I want to ask some questions about the project and hope (finger double cross) someone can standup and tell 1. It’s Oct already, which you mentioned in the update section that the product should be ready and Nov for mass production. Please give us some update. 2. Also in the backer survey it appears with the choice of iPhone XS / Max series, do it mean those are supported? The delivery schedule mentioned the Plus model first, and the X 7 8 model come a month later. How about these new iPhone series? 3. What about the 256gb and power bank option we paid for? You didn’t mention any for a very very long time. 4. What is the expected performance on the hardware Spec and android version for 1.5 years ago? So much to ask.... please give us some answer and....hope.... if any.... I have a new iPhone now. What to do What to do Wait let me guess ... It doesn’t matter. I am switching to iPhone Xs MAX Refund my money please! I have the XS Max now please upgrade! I want my smart case 🙂 Iphone7plus switched for an Iphone XSmax. Please let's hope this project isn't dead on arrival shipping out cases that are for phones most of us no longer have in our pockets... It is mentioned in the last Progress Update (1 September 2018). The website is <url>’s been)and still know smart android case for my IPhone I don’t know the only thing I got to hang on to are this updates I wonder if we will ever see this. Can I change to iPhone XS max? Please, i want to change the mine to XS PLus model. Im buying the new one. Lets do the class action suit against ESTI Inc. and KickStarter. This is a scam. Please refund my money I switched to iphone xs MAX Thanks! This information is great and should have been emailed out by the creator in an update. So, are we getting refunds per the Kickstarter T&Cs? No, silly people, that money is spent. We all got fooled by a hip grandma. Please refund my money - i switched to Samsung Galaxy s9 :-\ Refund my money, or I’m starting a class action suit. This tech is not viable any more. You took too long. you said"next iPhone come, we can change eye for next model" by #13 upgrade. I want EYE for iPhone XS Max. Thank you. Thank you ! While I've somewhat given up hope on this product, I did go back to open up my survey and the new iPhone models are listed. I plan on getting an iPhone Xs and so I switched it. We'll see. For those who want to switch but don't want to go back through the updates, I'll post the link. For those who don't want to trust the link I copy/pasted, the link comes from the September 13th, 2017 update titled Changing to the iPhone X/8/8 Plus. <url>’t be bothered by your mind games but either you deliver the damn product that we contributed OR you get fucked by karma, trying to rip us off. Be truthful & owe up! You fucking jewish **** ! Gimme my money back Mother fucker Dick ! When can products be shipped? I have an iPhone 7 Plus, but let's change it soon. I think. Which type of iPhone are you planning to handle? Depending on the answer I would like to make a refund. I am waiting for a good answer. I invoke my rights under Kickstarter's Terms or Use: <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill." I demand a full refund for my pledge amount ASAP. Although this is my 4th comment.. But I cannot see my older comments in the list... Are there any others too whose comments have been removed from here.. Amazing job kickstarter / ESTI... But this will definitely end like this the way you've planned, to fool all of us and digest the money... Soon you shall see a miracle... Rather we shall see a miracle.. Just wait and watch.... Countdown is on... Boooom Oh Damn... Now i get it... Have been such a fool to not realise this on day 1.... The AD... The mysterious Ad!.. Hey guys you remember the Ad video.... A 90 year old Lady shown using this case, dancing and jumping inside out,,, that means you shall have the case at age 90 only... Oh damn... Why did I back this project, I am not even sure if I will make it to 90... What if I kickstop at 60 - Hey ESTI Team, does this case comes in with a life insurance too?? iPhone 7 >> iPhone 8 >> iPhone X >>> iPhone 9 How to use iPhone 7 case into iPhone 9 ???? If you support iPhone 9 design, I will waiting your minimum 1 year to re-product ? Are you suggest me keep use iphone7(back this project, the mobile is new. hope no damage) or use iphone 9 & your smartcase for display only in my storeroom ? ( I'm regret back the "X4 units of Eye 4G Family pack" share to my friend, but they are change to other mobile now) I’m done waiting. I want a refund? How do I get a refund? Making phone cases must be the hardest thing: iExpander case on kickstarter failed Smartcase case on kickstarter failed umii-iphone case on indiegogo failed popslate 2 on indiegogo failed I could go on and on. Go on any of those and read the comments. They are almost the exact comments as you will find here and in the end, guess what happened ? Nothing. No one got anything I invoke my rights under Kickstarter's Terms or Use: <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill."

This update they have named the manufacturer so how to see something in hand LOL as if anything will ever be ready I put this in my will already for my grand-kids to get this case after I pass away ! Are you kidding me !!! I changed 3 phones since I did this pledge and today I have a Google Pixel 2 XL and I see no point of having this case anymore ! I want a refund because this is getting ridiculous !!! Even if I received the case by the end of this year it will be already out-dated and wont be able to sell it even !!! ESTI will be response for all court cost once it’s settled. This is ridiculous. I’ve already been through 2 phones in the time they’ve taken to jerk us around. They have to understand that we need to be able to at least change the model we originally ordered against....that is if they actually plan to release a product...ever. Someone has a lot of patience clearly That honestly doesn’t mean jack-sh/t. Many people have done civil suits. To do one for this project makes no sense, as court fees will cost more than the pledge! I request to see where my money is going. You can not deny this request as it is part of Kickstarter’s Terms and Conditions on article 4. Guys I’ve filed a civil case in superior court on Wednesday in NY. The lawyer will be reaching out to Kickstarter to get contact info of all backers involved in this mess. I will ensure they refund everyone’s money and plan to push for jail time. This company must not understand that this is 2018. Civil cases similar to what there doing are won by Customers everyday in superior court. Sharon I’ll advise you to distance your self from the company soon. That’s my legal advice. I am backer 4452, before backing I asked a few questions about how ESTi might be different from the iExpander. <url>’m over this! ESTI is a scam company but I’m personally disappointed with Kickstarter. I have lost complete faith in Kickstarter, who refuse to do anything about this scam. Will NEVER support any Kickstarter project from this point forward. We should abandon Kickstarter for their lack of accountability & care for their backers.

I was suprised to this also funded on the inigogo website: <url>#/comments Wonder if we'll ever get it.... funny though someone is answering people questions on the indiegogo web page but not here... Esti- you guys ROCK! This project proves that no matter your skill set or business intelligence, raising huge money can be achieved with a high-production quality campaign video at Kickstarter. Well played, Sirs. Well played. Of course if the same people who made the promotion video then had continued to also lead this project post-funding...maybe Esti would have an actual product at market and a huge bunch of Kickstarter backers as fans. totally... Lol, I lost like $200 on this. It used to make me mad now it makes me laugh. That’s how far behind you guys are. I’ve gone through all the stages of grief. Any new update? How long we will be delay? I would like to know if I will be getting the latest case for the newest iPhone? i no longer want the old case for the iphone Refund or update and support for newer phones Seems like a bunch of low life cheats in this high tech scam... karma awaits your team... Esti, Please do continue your work. Though newer iPhones include some of the Eye's advertised features, the Eye still brings creditable functionality making it a viable product. Apple continues to update older iPhones via software, so they too remain viable. I look forward to receiving the Eyes which I backed to add functionality to my iPhones. Please increase your frequency of updates to demonstrate good faith work on the Eye. Refund Refund Refund Refund Refund Refund Refund Refund Can I change from iPhone 6 to iPhone 7 Plus? Let me know how to do it if possible. Refund? I want a refund, most of the kickstarter campaigns are just bunch of cheats I think We will get Eye in 2020. Apple will invent foldable iphone.... iphone7.8.X...will be fossils! you said, final proto type would be completed at 18th July, Today is 1st August! When mecanical trouble was occurd, you could explained at 18th July. Why did not you explain on time!? Refound NOW! I've been waiting to the point where I went from a iPhone 7 to a iPhone X, and now I wonder how they're gonna deliver if the design of the X is vastly different from the 7 and plus how long will it take for prototypes to ship out? perhaps when the next iphone is released? or maybe longer than that? Just be honest and inform the backers you have ran out of money and "probably" looking for investors to further fund this project. It's been delayed for so long, How have you been paying your staff? How have you been paying yourself? Admit this was a god honest attempt, but it failed and you're crap outta luck. There cannot be delays after delays with whatever issue with China manufacturers, it simply does not make sense, because they've come pretty far making devices with the advance in technology. Unless of course you were conned into signing with a dubious manufacturer? Whatever it is, stop with the updates and let your backers know what they've known all along, you failed. There's no way anyone from this campaign will back any of your future products nor any other campaigns. Let your backers move on from this nightmare that is Esti. @Michael Elliott we get it, you eat everything they feed you. Just be honest and say you won’t come through with the product. That’s the least you can do. Getting a notification from you guys is always so disappointing because the only news you ever give is about “delays” I moved recently. Please tell me. How do I change my destination address? I'd like to change my order from iPhone 8 to "refund" ha! Is this still in development? Timeframe update? When will my item arrive? Is it possible to change my selection to an iPhone X or newer iPhone when available? After 2 years, coming back to this page is like finding your old phone in the drawer. ESTI Inc. this product is no longer relevant in a bezel less world. The BEST you can do now is deliver on time (without delays and no more design changes). I plan on purchasing one of the new iPhones for 2018. What opportunity will there be to change to that set of sizes since this project isn’t delivering anytime soon? Gents, Can I change to get the cover for iPhone X since I bought it recently and not using iPhone 7+ anymore? Do we need to wait for 5-10 prototype or need to wait for all 30-50 prototype for testing finish before showing ? if 5-10 prototype is completed i think can show the 5 -10 of it first without waiting for the rest to be all fully made All excited to see the prototype One thing good that came out of waiting for so long for the product is that I could still change my product from a iPhone 7 model to a iPhone model, because if one for the 7 came I wouldn't be even able to use it at all. It's amazing the claims of scam that proliferate on this board. One of the unfortunate aspects of KickStarter is that too many individuals pledge without understanding what they're actually getting into. This creator has, IMHO, completely missed the mark in estimating the time frame to manufacture this product. However, incompetence does not equate to scam. This is the risk those of us that pledge on KickStarter take when making a pledge. Accusing the Creator of evil intent may make you feel better, but doesn't really make sense. There are some Creators that, if they have other backing and/or an order backlog outside of the KickStarter pipeline, will provide refunds, This, however, at the discretion of the Creator, and NOT a requirement of KickStarter for Creators to provide to backers, unless the Creator has determined that he/she will not be able to fulfill a particular Backer's pledge (ever). Our recourse, when a Creator fails to deliver on time, is EXTREMELY limited. That is the nature of KickStarter. Individuals can vent on these forums, but that has no real value (maybe it makes them feel better). They can identify the Creator(s) and use social media to make sure their circle of influence are made aware of the Creator(s), and thus reduce the Creator(s) ability to garner support for future crowd-funding campaigns. If they truly have evidence of fraud, they can contact KickStarter - but missing dates and changing product specs is NOT evidence of fraud. Nor is poor communication. They are simply evidence of a Creator that is unlikely to succeed in bringing their product to market post KickStarter, since if they demonstrate a significant level of incompetence in the KickStarter process (in delivery and/or communication), that will likely carry over into regular production and result in failure. For the individual quoting KickStarter terms, a refund only applies if the buyer has determined he cannot fulfill your reward. It does NOT apply simply because the buyer has missed the delivery date. The terms clearly state that dates provided by Creators are simply their best guess at delivery, and NOT a commitment. I got a message from them about 2 weeks ago when I requested a refund. They said it's not possible to refund us, they also said due to them expecting things wrong it will unfortunately be "Very much longer" until the product is done. They apologize. Does anyone have a class action lawsuit started, or any advice on what steps to take? I'm gonna start looking into it. KS support has been very helpful but they can't do anything because the campaign owner already has the money. Therefore it's up to us, to take the legal steps necessary. @ESTI - Any update ? It’s been almost month since last one. That's true I did figure that out with KS CS however I was informed via KS that they can't refund us. It's up to the creator and KS actually has no way to contact or verify anything from the creator so if we can't come to a resolution with the creator, then it's up to us how we progress. Indiegogo started after Kickstarter and the funds value is inclusive of KS funds but they are responding there and no response here Yo contribuí con 151$ el 14 de Marzo del 2017 y la entrega estimada de la carcasa era para Septiembre del 2017. Bien pues a dia de hoy yo no he recibido nada. Desde los inicios han ido mejorando la imagen del producto y solicitándome que hiciera encuestas. Empiezo a pensar que esto es un engaño XD. Espero que Kickstarter.com no permita que en su página web se cometa ningún tipo de fraude ya que la reputación de la página quedaría gravemente afectada y estoy seguro que con este tipo de fraudes ninguna persona estará dispuesta a contribuir con proyectos que se patrocinen desde kickstarter.com Um... SO I just found out they had an INDIEGOGO campaign going at the same time as this.... in total they collected $1,463,220 from backers via both companies. This shit needs to be reported to the FBI for fraud and the FTC as fraud. They aren't going to refund our money so we need to contact Kickstarter support and your local Attorney General. Here is their Indiegogo page <url>#/comments Hey. I really need the money spend on this joke for other more important things. Please give me a refund. <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill." I demand a full refund for my pledge amount ASAP. I have backed the iPhone 7s plus model and still waiting. It is already iPhone X now. The only hold up for me to upgrade my phone is actually because of this case. I don’t want to upgrade my model to iPhone X then by the time I get it, it’s iPhone 11. So today is the day the finalized electronics are suppose to be complete. Hope everything is still on time based on the time line. Can we get some confirmation and updates on what’s going on. Also I’m curious to see what this sliding mechanism mock-up look like and hopes to see some testing on the prototypes soon. They emailed me and said it's impossible for them to refund me. It's not possible to refund. They are working on the product and trying to release this year. Agreed: Can we all agree to stop saying we are provoking rights that were posted in 2012. I agree with @Andrew Limon. Please address this issue with your backers! This case is going to be obsolete once it is released. Can I get one for the iPhone X plus???? Now it comes in October for the x model or September for 8/8plus... Dear Creators were you able to come up with a mock up piece Can we all agree to stop saying we are provoking rights that were posted in 2012....and can we please get some sort of update I had to laugh at EverythingApplePro's video this morning. I'm pretty accepting of the fact that i'll probably never receive my case but to see knockoffs coming out of china (even if this one is crappy) before something I ordered 12 months ago is a bit of kick in the guts. <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill." I demand a full refund for my pledge amount ASAP. <url>’t reach the goal. So... it’s not waterproof. Looks like you don’t answer the questions... What about the 64 GB some of us pfledged ? Because now the spec are 32 GB (not 16 GB as said at the beginning). Does it mean some of us spent monney for... nothing ? I hope you will respect your words and sens with 64 GB or more (I don’t speak about the microSD card). Is it going to be waterproof? Should the survey question be changed for more accurate reflecting of the iphone ? Is it still going to be available in jet white? It's better to tell us directly that you are fraudsters, so that you don't have to work hard to make an update every two weeks. Previously I was applying for iPhone 7plus but changed to iPhoneX the other day. I would like to change my application to iPhoneX. Thank you for your consideration. Really nice on the latest updates of the design, Can't wait for the real product to be released. Just a little question, for the basic sized model / iPhone X, there will not be any fingerprint power button as compared to the plus sized iPhone? I hope the design for the iPhone X is real if so I am excited to receive mine nice job on the design To everyone trying to invoke your rights under an old set of Kickstarter terms and conditions which don’t apply to this project: please read section 4 of the current terms which DO apply to this project. <url>’t be ignorant, For 64gb extra dollar u charge, is it the same as 32gb? please answer. I would like a refund for my full pledge amount please. As others have said, under Kickstarter's Terms of Use: <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill." Thanks. I want to update my phone and shipping details how do I do that?? I would plzz like a full refund I don’t have a iPhone that i order it for no more plzz can I have a refund Where have guys placed finger print sensor I would like a refund for my full pledge amount please. As others have said, under Kickstarter's Terms of Use: <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill." Thanks. In addendum to my previous comment, you most certainly have the ability to perform refunds: <url>"These are the terms that apply when you’re creating a project: You can refund individual pledges if you want. After your project has been funded, you can cancel and refund a backer’s pledge at any time. If you do, you have no further obligation to that specific backer, and no agreement exists between you. " Everyone of the backers that funded this and are requesting refunds are more than entitled to it considering the incredibly slow progress and poor estimates for completion. I would like my money back, please. I would like a refund for my full pledge amount please. As others have said, under Kickstarter's Terms of Use: <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill." Thanks. I bought it for iPhone X, so please return the investment. Thanks for the recent updates. Hopefully there are no more delays. Looking forward to finally getting this.

Hey, please reply me how to get the refund, I dun want to wait anymore I invoke my rights under Kickstarter's Terms or Use: <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill." I demand a full refund for my pledge amount ASAP PLEASE @Marteen. No NFC is the least of your problem. This project has become an obvious scam. Unfortunately I don’t believe you will ever see this product. The bogus updates are part of the scam. As long as they try to show they are actively trying to create the product, it is very hard to go after them criminally because we that suckers are actually considered investors and not all investments pay out and they come with risk. They are using this to facilitate what I believe to be a very methodical scheme to defraud. You will see months of further bogus updates that talk about production and engineering errors and having to change manufacturers etc. all to continue the scam. I had mentioned in a previous post that this is unfortunately the second time I fall for this so I am not angry. All backers just need to realize that complaining about certain features or lack thereof is pointless at this time. You won’t see this product or your money back. I want my money back don't want this anymore I'm done. Fake updates and fake project Please refund my money I invoke my rights under Kickstarter's Terms or Use: <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill." I demand a full refund for my pledge amount ASAP I do not see NFC in the latest spec? This was part of the original spec and the only reason I'm interested... I personally think there may be also other that are interested, since iPhone's have a very limited access to NFC. I WANT MY MONEY BACK NOW!!!!!!! I am not happy at all P.P.S. Don't blame the project team/hustlers - they're here BECAUSE they are faking it till they make it. Sadly, most are not clever enough to avoid hardware production traps and also have never worked with the product supply chain to have the required experience to deliver a product to market. Blind leading the blind - but sometimes they get lucky. P.S. ...not a single failed/delayed campaign ever returned my money, so any cries of "refund" only help in a cathartic sense, not a monetary one. However, I have successfully won credit card chargebacks against defunct / fraudulent campaigns so there's hope for you there.. Hey backers, my experience with this and other IGG/KS campaigns aligns with those who feel extremely frustrated with the lack of even a general delivery timeline from these crack-shots: this is one of 9 diff campaigns I've backed over 4 years since crowdsourcing became a thing. Of 9, only 5 delivered, and only 2 delivered ontime. This is the last time I back one – regardless of the fairy tale perks. It is cheaper to wait it out until Amazon sells it. The end. This is unacceptable. New iPhones will probably be out by October. Please explain this now! I invoke my rights under Kickstarter's Terms or Use: <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill." I demand a full refund for my pledge amount ASAP. What happen to NF Does the update mean October shipping for iPhome X? I would like to refund as I am no longer wait for it What happens if I no longer even use an iPhone anymore? This project has taken so long, that many of us have moved on to other phones! Its all good and well for people who just upgraded to another iPhone (that is assuming you will send them the case for their upgraded phone), but some of us may have moved on to an android while waiting for this. I had very high hopes for this product and was convinced that you had everything worked out. you didn't look like a scam at all. I am completely disappointed. I am very disappointed. I'm extremely hurt by the continuous delay. I would be very surprised if the case ever came. Still, the enormous delay is very hurtful. NO LONGER SUPPORTING KICKSTARTER. THEY DONT PROTECT CONSUMERS. 2nd time i’ve been ripped off. won’t be a third. @J. C. i totally agree with you that Kickstarter protects no-one in its platform and i have been scammed twice here too. But before the 2 scams, i have backed some projects that's successful, the biggest one would be Pebble then the TicWatch. But my conclusion is still to stop backing any kickstarter projects, because if the project successful, you can buy the same product in the market in almost the same price here. Sometimes even cheaper especially during festive seasons or special promotion like Black Friday, Cyber Monday el. so why take the risk where the return is identical. that's what i've learnt. One year late 😱, Does it fit Iphone L? F**k Folks. We have all been scammed. This is not the first project on Kickstarter to be an obvious scam and it won’t be the last. Unfortunately I fell for it twice so shame on me. You won’t see a penny back from them, Kickstarter will do nothing about it and they are sitting on the other end of a computer screen stringing us along with bogus updates so they give the appearance that they are “really trying to bring the product to market”. This is unfortunately the risk we take when we back a project. I just can’t believe that Kickstarter allows it. In my opinion they are enabling the criminal enterprise by not policing their own site. When will the case for the iPhone X be available? This will be the last thing I ever back on Kickstarter I can hardly ever get a response from the company when I email them, I backed this company a year ago thinking I would receive my product about 6 months later. Yet I haven’t. They have failed to keep their word. Maybe Kickstarter should follow up on company’s they sponsor. It’s a big fraud!!!! I invoke my rights under Kickstarter's Terms or Use: <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill." I demand a full refund for my pledge amount ASAP. I ordered on Apr 15 2017, but now I still not received. This is scam? Where's my case? Where's my money? HI, I need to change my delivery address, how can I do this? More than 2-3 week no updates already Any updates guys, if there is any feasible update do post it for us How about we all agree to stop posting that “I invoke my rights” crap. The very first thing it says at the top of that link is that those are only applicable to projects BEFORE 2014. It doesn’t apply to this one at all. These are the T&Cs for this project—and unless were all going to sue them? We have no rights to invoke. Give it up. “If a creator is unable to complete their project and fulfill rewards, they’ve failed to live up to the basic obligations of this agreement. To right this, they must make every reasonable effort to find another way of bringing the project to the best possible conclusion for backers. A creator in this position has only remedied the situation and met their obligations to backers if: they post an update that explains what work has been done, how funds were used, and what prevents them from finishing the project as planned; they work diligently and in good faith to bring the project to the best possible conclusion in a timeframe that’s communicated to backers; they’re able to demonstrate that they’ve used funds appropriately and made every reasonable effort to complete the project as promised; they’ve been honest, and have made no material misrepresentations in their communication to backers; and they offer to return any remaining funds to backers who have not received their reward (in proportion to the amounts pledged), or else explain how those funds will be used to complete the project in some alternate form. The creator is solely responsible for fulfilling the promises made in their project. If they’re unable to satisfy the terms of this agreement, they may be subject to legal action by backers.” Reliability is low. Please let me know. When will the latest news be updated?

This is my first and last Kickstarter. The Etsi brand is garbage, but Kickstarter should do something because this makes me not even consider any other campaign.

Is a creator legally obligated to fulfill the promises of their project? Yes. Kickstarter's Terms of Use require creators to fulfill all rewards of their project or refund any backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill. We crafted these terms to create a legal requirement for creators to follow through on their projects, and to give backers a recourse if they don't. We hope that backers will consider using this provision only in cases where they feel that a creator has not made a good faith effort to complete the project and fulfill. So the only way you're getting your money back is a lawsuit. Not worth the hassle, honestly. Just wait another 3 (or 6, or 9, or 12) months when it's delaye... I mean released, then immediately sell it on eBay to another schmuck that will regret their purchase.

As this was stated in the supported spectrums, I challenge this as a breach of contract to deliver product as defined in the prospectus. Please confirm receipt by the project team and Kickstarter management. Advise of the time in which I shall receive my refund. If processed within 30 days, I will not seek compensation for interest adjustment or escalate for governmental oversight and review. Merely wish to set clear expectations and potential courses of action. Further note - if this does become a legal action, I will seek to move this from an individual action to a class action.

I demand a full refund for my pledge amount Where is my device? Enough is Enough! They blow so much sunshine in our ass that it begins to shine through the mouth now I think this update confuses the situation more. The issue is not the iPhone X case model (as stated by your survey back when that was the "new phone"). But now the new phone by apple that will probably be released around September 2018. Will we be able to wait the 2 months more (assuming this case is ready in July) to get that one insted? Please be open and respond to our comments, you're not helping youself by not. I find it ironic that you can find the same cases online all over for half the price I pledged on this and these company’s didn’t have all this kickstarter money backing them, And had a product completed much quicker but hey ESTI is a scam so what are we to do. Maybe we will get the product in the next year and a half. I know after this I’m done with Kickstarter. I have backed three projects one was successful and got the product out. One was a scam they took the money and never released it and then this. Needless to say this one doesn’t look much different Then the last. 全額払い戻しを要望します。 今更ケースはいらないので、すぐに全額返金してください。 What a stupid update - By the time they do research and development for iPhone X, new iPhone will come we will want the EyeCase to work with that new iPhone. I really think we should all just get our money back, because they will never get the timeline correct of getting the case out in time. Lol this is fun update, you had said this on the day iPhone X released, so better stop such updates and update something materialistic I invoke my rights under Kickstarter's Terms of Use: <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill."

If you all would have figured this all out earlier then we wouldn't have this problem. What phone models are you making this for? If the iPhone follows the regular pattern, then the new phone will be out about two months later (in September). Well the good news is that if you still want this android case for your iPhone, you can now widely buy it on ebay! And it's cheaper than buying it on kickstarter!

What you do is take a big update and split it into one week and the other the following two week update. Also it would be considerate to give a small update on how the meeting went from the production partners as your lack of communication is not as well as other companies post updates to keep their backers in the loop. invoke my rights under Kickstarter's Terms of Use: Http://www.kickstarter.com/terms-of-use/oct2012 "Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannor fulfill."

It’s about principle. When anyone goes into a contract, it’s on a basic principle that you do your part I do mine. Not about throwing my money down on a crap shoot. I think you are misunderstanding the main point here. I’m not crying over $149 or whatever the pledge was. The point is Kickstarter needs to hold these people liable for their BS! Otherwise people will see this as a way to make some quick money and get over on folks. So for now on, I will wait until the product hits the market and pay full price if I want It. That’s how much I don’t care about being an “Earlybird” or a “supporter” because nobody is supporting us! since You seem to think money is the main factor here. I’d rather spend more $$$ for a finished product, I can decide on with a warranty and/or legit return policy.

Read the first line of the link you are posting: This page applies only to projects launched on or before October 18th, 2014 at 11:59pm ET Now, does it suck that we might not see our product? Yes. Did we go into this knowing this? Yes. So, suck it up buttercup! That is part of the deal with Kickstarter. If you are spending money you can’t afford, step away from the keyboard! @THOR ITO Try the survey I guess @Dustin Wilson they mentioned in a previous update that they couldn't issue refunds at this point I believe. @Seungju lee your best bet is probably going to be the survey. @Edgar Allan Oblena see my last two posts about surveys. I dunno if they'll honor changes at this point or not, but it doesn't hurt to ask. I imagine their inboxes and what not are kinda overwhelmed with the constant "I invoke my rights" spam. Seriously guys. I get it. You want a refund. Your rights, however, aren't crap and unless you've got a local Attorney General to act as hero for you (which is about the only way to get any traction at all, most lawyers I read of explain that KS's Term's of Use boil down to "Try really hard, ok guys.. otherwise Yolo". So we get it. Let people talk in the meantime. @Hermes I would look for the survey link and see about changing it, there was an option to wait for the next phone originally, I'm sure some folks clicked that. It might have been you! @Coleman Search your email for the address eye-smart-android-case-for-<email> or your history for "<url>" you can't use that link just to go to the survey however, as it requires some ?foo=bar variables in the link as to link it to your account.

You promised a product one month after release of new phone. So does that now mean you have not even started on that case?? This is going to ship after the next iPhone comes out making it useless. Refund please. WHERE IS THE UPDATE??????????????? No refunds are possible. Slimy POS don’t give refunds. Jodio Hi Creators please give us valid update, your last update was little better. Please keep the design shared which was rendered as image in initial updates after sucessful campaign Refund please and answer for our requests. So tomorrow is an update which I am hoping brings better news as others have not brought anything other than angry backers as you have made the making of this case to a crawl as you haven’t picked a manufacturer to make this case as well as given us any info on the MFi and if all the other necessary things needed to make this case are ready as in update #30 you were going to communicate better which with what I can see that has not happened. Also have not seen anything of you supposedly been at CES and even though the white case was a prototype I am hoping it has a lip to protect the iPhones screen. And as Chinese New Year comes closer as they will be off two weeks you haven’t mentioned that as the holiday will surely put a halt of production of any type. Sooo, we are waiting. At such a slow pace, the stuff will be outdated and not match any phone when it comes out. i wanna change to model with sim please. Please finished this project either by giving the product or refund the amount. I was order and backed this project when their is not even iPhone 7 exist but know world and exprenicing iPhone x but you guys not yet finished the project. So its better u should start refunding process. I ordered two iPhone 6s cases and can I change one to the iPhone 7 Plus model? So it seems like the creator doesn't care about people that have been asking for a refund, stating "these answers will probably be the same even if you keep sending refunding requests" ("We can't refund, it's used towards development") I suggest those of you that want a refund go to your bank and file a chargeback with the charges you've placed during the campaign. I'd also suggest reporting this project to Kickstarter with the "Report this project to kickstarter" button on the Campaign page at the very bottom as well. Please, i want you refund my money, because i changed my phone for an iphone X. Our latest prototype has allowed us to have representatives with devices on hand at CES this coming week. So where are the pics and info about you supposedly being at CES 2018?? The next update is this Sunday 1/21/18 and hopefully you have better information of getting these cases made and fulfilled to promised time of Mid 2018 as holidays are coming soon for I think Chinese New Year and they’ll be closed for two weeks I think. I have already changed the model from iPhone 6 to iPhone 7, can I use it? Thank you for the better worded and more informative update this time around.

The battery in the case is supposed to be able to charge the iPhone. As for network compatibility, I suggest that go with method that has more global significance, which I think GSM is it. Basically people needing multiple SIMs are those whom are traveling a lot. So the global usage is more important then just the US market. Mediatek has a reputation of providing solutions, it might probably be useful to contact them. First of all I want to say that I don’t want a refund - I still believe in this project and hope to hold mine in hands soon. But I wondered how you would manage the fact that the iPhone X (which I own) has the camera vertically placed - I wonder if the display size could be affected by this fact. I changed my back early to an iPhone X Version because I knew I would get one and now I’m curious if the vertical camera could change the case. I hope I’ll get an answer soon and looking forward to get mine finally, A still believing Guy from Germany �� I’m not sure if this will ever be read but... You are attempting to hit a moving target and failing. The longer you delay the worse it will be. This year, I opted to get an iPhone X and signed up to the refresh program. I think this means that you are unable to provide an Eye for my present phone, and by the time you are, I will have moved on. “Caveat Emptor” I realize that if i’d thought about this carefully I would have realized this was a zero sum gain. As it happens, my provider has created a secondary digital line and so my reasons for investment no longer apply. Keep my investment with compliments, I hope you can produce your product in time before the target iPhones are retired. This investor no longer requires their reward. Goodbye and Good Luck.

I demand to be invited to any amazing parties. This will be my last Kickstarter ever. In future I will wait to see that a product is successfully launched then pay the retail price. F*** Y** Kickstarter. You need better terms and conditions to protect the backers from shams like this. So disappointed. I invoke my rights under Kickstarter's Terms of Use: <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill." I demand a full refund for my pledge amount I invoke my rights under Kickstarter's Terms of Use: <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill." I demand a full refund for my pledge amount At this point you should be saying “we have listened to our backers and we will do the originally backed 5.0 inch and do the 5.5 inch when the 6.1 and 6.5 iPhones come out in 2018.” It shouldn’t be hard to tell us a lot of information we have asked for and even more since you took about 1.2 or 1.4 million dollars from Kickstarter and Indiegogo. Chinese New Year is in February and there is two weeks lost so I hope you took into affect for that holiday. You should also have the maker of the case and have all the parts but for some odd reason your dragging your asses and mid 2018 is when we”ll supposedly get the cases per your saying. So January 7 is the next so called update so there better be good news other than the copy/paste stuff you’ve did lately and add a small bit of new information.

I demand a full refund for my pledge amount I invoke my rights under Kickstarter's Terms of Use: <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill." I demand a full refund for my pledge amount After this failure, I’m done with Kickstarter, not funding anything else unless I get a refund. I would like to ask for a refund as well. My iPhone 6 is due for replacement in August and my company is now allowing Androids anyway. I thought this would have been shipped by now and at this point I have no confidence in the product (assuming this starts up) Can you by chance include the iphone 8 series in the line up.. Rip forgot this actually is supposed to have a headphone jack If anything this delay will hopefully allow them to include a headphone jack into the case b/c Apple is not getting money from using the headphone jack Can i change my pledge to an iPhone 12. Thanks I'd hereby formally request a refund of my pledge amount. I don't feel this is leading towards a good end and I'm not willing to wait until mid2018 only to hear that all the funds are gone. So, please, refund my pledge. A little early for that Nadim. They technically still have time, even if it's not looking good. I invoke my rights under Kickstarter's Terms of Use: <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill." I demand a full refund for my pledge amount Yet another useless update. Suprise Suprise Are these guys even trying anymore? I swear I’ve seen the same update for the last 3 months. I think we’d rather have no update instead of a copy paste job every 14 days. Come on guys, please give us a real update. If this is a non-starter, then come clean. If there is a possibility that this project will be available within the 1st 6 months of 2018 then great, if not, let us know. Good luck & I hope to get a more detailed update asap. We still haven’t gotten a picture. I asked Santa for one but I guess he didn’t hear me lol. And please others stop getting mad at ppl for being upset. We all put money into this and we are have a right to say what we want about it. You may not agree with it but it’s the truth. Because honestly I still want to box with the owners for my money but they haven’t taken me up on my offer. Jaime Lopez - I hope your anti-Semitic comment is soon removed. Too bad you posted it today because if it were yesterday...you’d have a lump of coal in your stocking this morning. Maybe you were trying to just be funny but if that IS how you feel then let’s hope it goes all the way with the joke on you taking you straight to bankruptcy. Glad to not have biweekly update And I thought jokes about Jewish people and money were just that... jokes. Apparently the joke is on me Time for refunds! Not sure if it would work. Kickstarter can say we "backed an idea" so we don't get money back. That's what happened to me when I filed a dispute. Would be great Spencer. They are not willing to corporate (a part of) a refund I have already begun the process to file a class-action lawsuit against ESTI INC from the United States District Court of Norfolk, VA. As soon as an account is set up, I will post more information on here as to where to email your information so you may be added to the list of filees. Everyone check out “inkcase” as it offers much of the same features here. It offers a 2nd e-ink screen on the case. Doesn’t have a second sim chip or the fancy screen, extra battery, qi charging, or an android cpu...but protective case, images, e-reader, selfie-help, key messages/alarms/weather- yes it does. It also is at market now and can be purchased for $69 at Touch of Modern up to $149 depending on the model/size. Meanwhile this project is limping along with poor to nonexistent communication and no delivery date in sight. Very bad signs for this project ever making it... Overfunded by 600% and produced nothing. Still advertising for more backers when they can't fulfill orders already placed. It smacks of organised theft and Kickstarter say there is nothing they can do? How about shutting the f**king page down? I won't be backing anything on KS again. F**k 'em! Who knows where they at hands and feet Calm down everybody, they will release this one sometime in 2020 or later. I have had a couple messages back and forth with them and each time they said that they are unable to refund our money and it does not work like that. I think this is theft and theft of money is a federal offense and they should get in trouble, but they won't. They have told me two or three times they cannot refund our money. They can take our money but they can't refund it? That sounds like bullshit to me and kick starter won't do anything either. Ton me Kickstarter is just as liable as the criminals that took our money. I will never use Kickstarter ever again thanks to these assholes!!! So you promise a product but can’t reimburse or deliver on time. Remember this is a global community where reaching out and touching someone is easy to do and relatively inexpensive if u can’t do what you initially promised than You should start refunding backers ASAP. �� Can we just square up for my money. Don't think I would lose. We might as well have fun on the comment section. I'ma get my money worth on these posts. Honestly nobody in the company whooping me ���. I think that the people who want to refund are foolish because the investment for this product is on their own responsibilities But I also think that your replies were always disappointed us because I felt you are not doing your job. It’s your responsibility. You have to keep your promise you will show some pictures of the product or prototype! I don’t hope you to refund but to send me the product early. Are you ok? I apologize in advance that English is not my first language. Regard. I'd like refund please. Thanks These people are full of it! I would like a refund as i've purchased a iPhone X after the screen issue settle already then they will say they have issue with the casing material , bluetooth , wifi , etc componet need to change then again drag until 2020 the casing still not out yet Whats next etsi? "We invested your funds into bitcoin but unfortunately our Wallet got hacked"? Stop messing about and get the product done. I want a refund as i've got iphone x already The next thing they are probably going to say: delay due to controversial capital issues... I anyone using the wrinkles in their ass could have told them the screen size they mentioned was an issue. You don’t need two weeks to figure it out. Where is the proof that you tested it? Documents, videos, anything to go off of? Here's what's going to happen. They are going to update every few weeks. There are going to be these small issues that cause delays for like 3 years. And then they'll tell us they are out of funds and run off enjoying their free ride. It's a story happening more and more here on ks and on ig. Sucks when it happens, but I suggest everyone just email, tweet, facebook messages to kickstarter letting them know that you are not backing anyone future projects on their platforms until they fix this problem. And then don't. Until we speak with our wallets, this issue ins't going to get fixed. If you're not willing to do that, then my advice is to honestly just walk away and forget you ever backed this. You will just be pissed everytime an update comes out. 3rd project this has happened to me on and it's not worth the headache following it. You aren't going to get the product. You aren't going to get your money back. Safe yourself the headache. Sorry, but that's just how it is. sucks. big time. Hey, so new to the whole Kickstarter backing program. First project to back was this one but much like the comments I am getting a new iPhone next year that will make this case obsolete. I'm just wondering if there is an actual way to request a refund and cancel my support of this product. Please comment if you know a way to do that and to the creators of the EYE Smartcase campaign. I know that it's not a simple process of telling you to make the damn case already, but I backed this as a college student. The 150 dollar backing was not an easy thing to budget for, thanks for taking the time to read this and hopefully provide some insight. In the meantime, I'll be looking for a solution to the problem at hand and update progress. Just tell the truth! That you guys spent the money on **** to fuc us in the @ss. You guys can go to hell ! I hope I get to see you guys face to face real soon here. Everyone of you having problems or upset and losing faith, go report the project/people to Kickstarter! If enough of us report them for their deceit/incompetence, maybe we can get the refund we requested! So I will be switching to the Note by Jan. Which makes this case useless for me. I like the idea of the case but it has taken to long. I'm no longer will be having an iPhone. Unless this fits the note. If not I would like a refund. I think like many of us we are losing faith in this project. And like many people, it's about to run an update cycle of my phone from the 6s to the 8. I'm hoping that if this project does get off the ground we have the option of selecting whatever our relevant phone is at the time of shipping well its getting closer and closer to being a year since they took our money and no product to actually show. :/ Welp Won't Be Backing Anything Else On Kickstarter Or Any Other Site Lioe Kickstarter :/ I hope the next update will have video of how you are testing the screens and not just words. Steve I would like it before the phone I got it for is obsolete Can we just worry on the 5” inch case and worry about the 5.5” until the 5.8, 6.1, 6.5 supposedly comes out next year? I would like this case ASAP Zak were you refunded ??? Hahaha this is funny. Looking at a new design before the first one has been produced. Daffy Duck must be managing this fiasco. Thank You for issuing me my refund! Please stick on with 5 inch screen S Nunn +1 For all those that are new or green on backing on Kickstarter,whining because they don’t want to wait or complaining about the updates. This is a CROWD FUNDING PLATFORM. Give your creators some love and help them by being positive. It is not easy getting a project to come to reality. EyeSmart,I have faith in this project,please don’t waste time or money on redesigning,unless it is absolutely necessary! Once you have your 1st products completed and made well,then you go on to eyesmart 2.0. When you switch things up because you guys can’t make up your minds,it makes you all look wishywashy and people loose faith. I have backed many many projects and am considered a superbacker of Kickstarter. Not all projects came to fruition,lost 1000’s of $$$$$’s. STICK WITH YOUR PLAN AND YOU WILL GO FAR! ONLY Make changes when absolutely necessary Please stop making changes to the design and make the product we paid for already! I feel like reading every two weeks the same thing, let's say the same shit, there is no progress, it feels like a scam ones again on kickstarter. tired of this, please be a bit decent and refund ! No, you can’t get this product. It doesn’t exist and never will. These are con artists hiding behind a huge string of lies and fake product drawings. Complete fake. Will never be delivered. When they have used all the money (within a month) they will announce that they can’t deliver and will walk away leaving supporters holding the bag. Criminals and liars. How about just stick with the concept you had on your KS project and make the 5.0 screen and do the 5.5 inch screen next version and give the backers the price you charged for this case as I’m sure the backers want their cases now and not wait further to get the 5.5 inch screen and make it make it later after mid-2018 I feel sorry, the way you have been treating your more than 600,000 USD investor/backers. This attests to the way the KICKSTARTER type campaigns destroy the image of potential innovators. Well, if you have any honesty left in your soul, offer refunds along with whatever interest that you have earned from the money invested in your project! I hope you’ll listen to my request. Can I get this for the iPhone X? hello, i changed my mind, i requested to wait for new iphone, but i decided to remain with current iphone 7 (not plus) . so can you already send me current model? where to write to tell my decision? there is support email? is good to write here? please inform So the rumors are at it with the 5.8, 6.1, 6.5 inch iPhones for 2018. Makes me think if I should just stick with my plus or wait for newer but since it’ll be almost a year to get this one if that I would be stupid to wait another year for the 2018 case. Hopefully tomorrow will be somewhat good news but considering the lack of communication from the team I doubt it will be good news as supposedly these cases will be out Mid 2018 no sooner as they said in last or latter update. @Barry Miller: Ditto, iPhone7 6 inch display smartcase for IPhone XI (11) Only they can do post biweekly updates till IPhone XII (12) You guys used kickstarter to robbery !! Thats all i can say ! Well done, good job Announced 5’ inch Now 5’5 inch Next 6’ inch I purchased an iPhone6 only for the purpose of carrying my new Eye-Smart Case. Will you offer an iPhone SE version? I decided to change to an iPhone SE as I think it's the best iPhone made to date. Glad to get response :), it's not an easy project so would like to support the creator and wait Do you have an iPhone x design? I'very contacted them many times about refunds and this is the latest response from them... ESTI Inc. says: Hi Carl, Sorry for the late reply. As we already answered you as well as explained in our weekly reports, we are completely aware and very sorry for the situation that the delay combined with lack of details that we can supply had created bad feelings and even loss of faith. We really hope that in relatively short period (after will sign a contract with the manufacturer) we will be able to give more details. In any case the Kickstart support includes risks, we really trying to make sure that the only risk in the case of the Smartcase will be the delay of supply, since your support is used for the development, we cannot issue refund. We really hope that you will continue to support us with the same spirit that made you support us at the beginning. Regards, ESTI team I demand a refund. So another update that actually gives us NO UPDATE! Bunch of scam artist. Love how they claim to address non existing request but fail to address the most common request here. REFUND!!! If you guys don’t get MFI certification, make it USB-C power delivery. Make it future compatible please fxxk No more kickstarter project for me too Another week, another bullshit update. Face it everyone we all got scammed, this will be the last project I will back on Kickstarter! Another useless update :( Please wait calmly. Kickstar is non-refundable. Eye must make good products. Don't think I am a fraud. Sgnl, Wait one year. Sgnl do unveils quality products that are good for good designs. iphone X change :D Thank you for updating. I look forward to it. Despite not getting things set up for the manufacture to have it made for holidays hopefully there will be viable news as in mould pics, parts, MFi certification. Please guys, communication is the key and let’s us know what’s going on. Refund my money please Marties I don't agree with you, have asked them about MFI approval status at least few times here and privately, no response till date. Can u please find out as they are responding to you. Again am not interested in refund can wait for this case. All the best Esti guys @Steve F I think it's a combination of when you posted the private message because the comments are probably a real giant mess right now and if it was reasonable/formal enough. By formal enough I mean a genuine question and not you shouting at them for a refund. This is Kickstarter. Sorry to break it you guys but no refunds :/. To prove my point on the fastness of their replies. I had some genuine questions and I just noticed I got a reply (sent wednesday and I received a reply on thursday). When I noticed I got a reply I sent another message and they replied in about 20 minutes. The last message is showcased in my previous comment. I'm going to wait a while on this product and encourage Esti to keep their head up. They can still deliver a great product. Also theirs a lot of negativity in this comment section so I'm being optimistic. My question: Hey! Are you still making the charging dock for the phone because I pledged $20 extra. Also can you give us guys a timeline on what you are doing etc. Everyone has been asking for it so please just make us less scared by giving it to us. Esti's Response: Hi Maties, Yes,we will make the charging dock for the iPhone. We are fully aware of the hard situation with our backers. We share with you the information that we can share at this time and we know it is not enough. We will do our best to minimize your scared and to give you more confidence with our great product. Thank you for your support, we appreciate it. Regards, ESTI team refund x infinity. FML Again an again the same problem. People try to create projects and they don't have the competences. I stopped lost my monney, this project was the last I baked. Once again Esti has logged into their account without answering comments/questions. So I guess this Sunday Nov. 12 we’ll get another useless update. You have lost the trust in your backers due to the lack of communication. Hello sorry to do this but I need to request a refund. 2018 is just too far away. I don't even know what phone I'll have by then. I was intrigued by idea but I just can't wait that long. Thankyou. I would like a refund. I will have had multiple phones by the time mid 2018 rolls around. Refund please 私の117ドルはどうなっちまうの？ My order is iphone 8s, can I change it to iphone 7 plus? I’d like to cancel my order. Please give me a refund. Please report this project at the bottom of this page, contact KS and state this as fraud, scam, file a sue to ETSI team if possible. shipping by mid 2018.. i’ll have a new phone by then, making this case useless to me, thanks guys �� These people... We all feel got scam! Refund! Refund ! refund please @wendy I agree with you as a regular backer, but this was not how things were expected to turn. So I feel the backers who are not happy need to be refunded as there has been completed mishap from creator. I can wait though. All these paper should have been iron out with the relevant authority or iso or etc . Someone in the chat had asked n I recalled they say they had get the necessary paper approved . Which left the funding for the production. Now it turn out all these r not done . I would say it is scam or fraud. Dear Wendy, I am sure most people here didn't pay for their "hope" nowhere in the ad does it state "maybe you will get the case" So you are welcome to take it for what it is but the rest of the people here i'm sure don't feel as you do. First and last Kickstarter experience. Please refund. When you back a kickstarter project you are taking a risk. Think about it. You would be getting basically two phones for $100ish, it's a cool idea. We backed an idea that may never be feasible but we liked the idea so much we wanted to see someone give it a shot. If this is money that you need to feed your family, you should not be "investing" in kickstarter projects. You are basically giving money to someones dream/idea that you believe in and hoping it will become reality and you can show your friends the cool, newest, hippest product to hit the market. If it doesn't happen, it's not because they didn't try, it's because of a million little problems along the way that add up. But you shouldn't complain because you gave this team hope that they could make this idea a reality. There are no sure things in kickstarter. Quit complaining and take it for what it is. On their main campaign page, it says "GET NOW" - HAHAHAHAHA One year late.... thus far.... Product delayed is product denied. We've been scammed. Good luck with chargebacks. It's unlikely. When i tried, kickstarter sent my CC a copy of their terms of service and said i funded an idea... Anyone who has back with credit cards should call them to inquire as I call Discover and requested a charge back and told her the reason why and that the creator fails to reply to comments on here and emails so we shall see if I get my money back. This is the last time I back anything else due to this. If they replied to backers comments then I would have no issues waiting til mid 2018 but what’s funny is they supposedly hired someone to reply to comments and emails. Thanks a lot ESTI, you ruined it for creators with good ideas and create their dream. I also want to add, its pretty obvious this item will never be shipped. This guy is clearly trying to wear us down with useless updates and eventually we will forget about ever ordering this. This is my first and last kickstarter I will ever back. What a fiasco. I dont blame this guy anymore, he scammed us, fine, we are all suckers, he is likely on a beach somewhere with over half a million dollars laughing. I am more upset with realizing Kickstarter will allow anyone to post a project and collect money without the legal need to fulfil the project. Condescending “update” is nothing but a token gesture. We no longer support you or believe in your ability to deliver. You are presently engaging and my activities that you should have already completed over a year ago. You refuse to refund even though you know you cannot deliver. I assume you misused the funds. I am at the stage where even if you can ship today, I want no further dealings with your sorry excuse of a company. Issue refunds now! Please be respectful and considerate of the backers and kickstarter community, issue refunds (I would like a refund). Guys, i have high respect for KickStarter... If you are not able to deliver by Mid Dec2017.... please REFUND. I do not wish to wait any longer. Please be considerate This is 'Ridiculous' its almost over a year.... I don't think i want to wait any longer.... Please REFUND. Nice! I’ll have my $100+ case for a whole two weeks before I get a new phone! Refund Please. This is rediculous. By their estimates, even if delivered on time, the next Iphone will be right around the corner. In short - I want a refund! This project is getting worst. I was willing to give the benefit of the doubt and believe they were working towards something earlier this year but the continued lack of communication & response from them along with the mid 2018 delay now is the last straw I want a refund Reported in kickstarter They never deliver their own word. middle of 2018? FXXXXX! Do I use iPhone 7 until next year? Refund my money Yes, in all seriousness, I want a refund. Hundreds of dollars to back a project that was nowhere near ready for production. This is a formal request of a refund of all funds. Anyone know the proper route since they will ignore this comment like all others? FXXXX, EYE made me a fool... Full refund~! If comments and emails were answered I would somewhat accept the delay but since comments are only done every two weeks as an update I’m not accepting the problem. I want full refund!!!!! Can you see the reactions very unprofessionally done you certainly wasn’t ready to come forth and ask for backers you are not even ready to start now you need to make an effort to make this right and personally I for one don’t know how you could Kicck starter is a forum to get concepts of the ground but come on your really stretching it I will be surprised if you keep any original backers but then that’s a good business move cause no one will get it for a cheaper price shame shame shame @ESTI ... We pledged under certain assumptions and expectations... that you couldn’t keep. You should refund the money and do another Kickstarter campaign when you’re ready. So far you’re only words (false promises)... NO Action. Report this project !!! I guarantee they cannot delivery Mid 2018 as well... which by the way is not a solid date... Mid 2018 could mean anytime till fall. Unacceptable !!! Will you be updating your range to include the iPhone X & the 8 Series? WTF!!!! 6 months delay. Thats ridiculous u should have given a good estimate date of shipping while we were backing. 2 months delay is ok. December shipping was fine but mid 2018 is ridiculous. Apple comes out with iPhones every 6-8 months and by the time u say will ship there will be an iphone 9 and more. Either ship in December-Jan or refund our money. I’ve reported this project and everyone else needs to too. You can do it at the bottom of the projects page. Everyone please report this porject at the bottom of the project page. I would also like a full refund. If the problems are severe enough that the creator can't fulfill their project, creators need to find a resolution. Steps should include offering refunds, detailing exactly how funds were used, and other actions to satisfy backers. For more information, see Section 4 of our Terms of Use. I'd also like to request a full refund. Full refund! Please issue me a full refund, by the time this is project comes to fruition the iPhone Xs Plus will be released. Between this and Smartkase I have had it (throws hands in air) I want a refund, period. Dot. End. Before my order Is “fulfilled” as quoted from those @$$holes at “Smartkase”who sent me a prehistoric prototype of some kind and deemed it a fulfillment. 我操你妈 means I am your mother fucker I just lost my hope! Then I see this update! Mid of the 2018 ??? iPhone 11 is be soon coming out ! What is happening with you! Are you kidding us!! I want an refund now!!! Backer Number 1217 I don’t think so we can get our money back ! They are already use all the money on **** and heroin already! WTF ! Err... mid 2018? Can I at least get a partial refund? I backed 2 hoping to get one before the new iPhones were released and one after... now I’m stuck having paid for two but won’t need the older one anymore if the timeline is mid 2018 LOL and now we’re up to mid-2018... time to file that dispute with my credit card company. So should I be excited as tomorrow is another boring azz update like all the other 24 of them?? I Demand full refund!!!! Yeah. I looked at the esti.me site and misread that part thinking it said internal memory. :( 64GB is highest for internal memory for $59.00 and can take up to a 256GB microSD card It's honestly quite frustrating that I don't have this yet, but others I've talked to have said that it's not uncommon for projects to be delayed and that they've gotten what they've backed. So I'm holding on to hope that you guys come through. Please don't let us down. I see on the campaign and web site that it now says upgradable to 256GB, but the survey doesn't give the option to do so. Only the option to upgrade to 64GB. When will we have the option to do so and how much will it cost? @Tyler - I got the same but would you really want to spoil your beautiful X with an Eye?! Enjoy! I managed to get an iPhone X delivering on launch date. Would love to see what the prototypes are looking like. I would also love to see my unit by xmas but I can wait. Same old s$&@ just a different day with these guys @SwordmasterT Yes they do work. I was successful in winning my dispute a few months ago with another campaign. I paid with American Express, which always favors the customers over the merchant. Anyways, as expected, they did not reply and I went ahead and filed my dispute. That campaign also used Crowdox for dispersement and I sent the screen shot itemizing what I was paying for. Feel free to join the Facebook group that was setup for that other campaign to get tips from other backers that successfully disputed their charge. YMMV depending on your bank. <url>’m frustrated with your lack of updates. I’m about to file a dispute for both, but I thought about it and I’m willing to make a compromise with you. Refund me for one of the case and the added upgrades and I’ll hold off on my dispute. Once I get the first case, I’ll purchase the 2nd one. I still believe in your product, but I’m not seeing any significant progress. I’ll give you a week to reply. If not, I’m going to file a chargeback for both. Thank you for your understanding. Well it's 10/22 and haven't gotten a reply, their last login was 10/19. On 10/23 I will be filing a dispute. I double checked with AMEX before pledging and I have a year to file that dispute. I had such high hopes for this campaign... another disappointment! No Update and respond... Ignored 4 of my direct messages and you think this isn't a scam? If money is not used can easily do the refund unless otherwise. We need substantial proof n evidence that the necessary paperwork had been submitted to regulatory or authorities n had been approved. If it is not approved, what is the next measure . It will give us the confidence which included regular reply n communicate, not 2 weeks 1 update but without any substances . At least make the effort to reply daily . If u show effort we can still give u reasonable time but if no effort everyone will ask for refund . Lastly when can the production start n end . There is no answer . i aked fo refund but they said no and that they assure me i will be able to sell it to make a profit... can i please get a refund... u can sell my unit and keep that profit urself Well damn. The update wasn't helpful. I put in a dispute in September but today Kickstarter responded to it. So RIP. Patience is one thing but gives us a reason or something to help be patient. Your comments hold no wait. So at this point, I assume they are coasting time until they don't have to update or something anymore. I would love to be proven wrong. But I do doubt it. Probably my last Kickstarter. with android Z... it is come out when iphone XXX come out Refund my money please Every comment in here being ignore.... This product is complete and utter vaporware. I want my money back. Very Disappointed, Not Responsible, Very reflect the Eshhit. Please Report to police anyone live United States.... Not encouraged. Frankly the excuses don't sound too great either. Bath water? Baby? Who-what? Get things figured out fast because you are running out of backer confidence very quickly. Not trying to be mean, just letting you know that pressure you feel is real; lots of people are trusting you to deliver these cases, and you aren't doing a lot to inspire confidence. Creator please update MFI approval status while you are speaking to manufacturers, guys ask for MFI apple approval status than spamming about refunds and that status will give us better idea and you guys can force refund bases on that, for me am not interested in refund I want the case that's it. ESTI Inc. says: Hi Carl, We understand your refund request for the money you have paid for the SmartCase campaign. The KICKSTARTER module is based on using the raised money to develop an innovative product and deliver it to the backers and then to the market. Such a model is irreversible. Your decision to support us is highly appreciated and we are doing our best efforts to make it as good and as fast that we can. We are happy that we can say that we succeeded to operate very thin, so far and we are managing lean process to make sure that you will get a quality product. We have to admit that due to wrong and too optimistic original road plan, the project completion will be quite much longer. We can assure you that we are doing everything that in our power to accelerate it . Regards, ESTI team To Anton Jalil and all those asking about refund or demanding refunds, I emailed Esti Inc. and they said that they are unable to give refunds. It's bullshit because they can, they just WON'T. I plan on going to an android phone soon and they still said that they "can't refund my money" Give a dateline once and for all. If you can’t or missed it again, refund the money. We can’t all keep waiting forever. You initial deadline was misleading. Saul, if you’ve a credit card provider willing to refund a 6month+ transaction, once again I beg you, tell me who they are so I can sign up. That’s one of the major drawbacks to kickstarter; they themselves never refund and by the time you realize there’s a problem it’s too late for the bank/cc company to do anything either. It’s great for criminal protected fraud. In the meantime folks playing internet lawyer and asking for refunds is doing very little to actually help. If someone has a magic bullet to get our money back, or better yet get us out cases that would be super awesome. In the meantime it’s all just noise. My hope was to encourage folks to search out that magic bullet, I’ve tried myself on several projects (super backer here, backed tons of stuff, got ripped off a great number of times) and have yet to find that magic bullet. I,too, used to call for refunds until I did the leg work and discovered Kickstarter has no routes for this and the cc/banking companies are moot at this point. Hell, my wife backed a project that someone else claimed copyright on AFTER it was funded. As such Kickstarter won’t give the project creator doesn’t get the money to actually do the thing and the backers aren’t getting refunded either. If you’ve got ideas; please enthrall us. I don’t understand what’s the hold up. I’m going to come meet you guys face to face to get some answers. Answering and addressing your backer’s questions and concerns do not qualify as updates. That could’ve and should’ve been done in the comments section or the FAQ section. An update is providing information about the progress you’re making for our device. I’m not seeing any progress. I will be filing a dispute. Let me know when you have something substantial to report and I’ll retract my dispute. Also Esti is complete ASS like I don't care at this point. This is beyond done. I strongly encourage a class law suit if possible. It should be done before they can claim bankruptcy “We assume that some of you may be frustrated reading this report and we are sorry to ask you to keep your patience longer.” Patience isn’t voluntary. This company is either staffed by the most idiotic and redundant of staff and management, or they are highly effective con artists. We got scammed. Mark no one is asking you. If people would like to ask them let them. Some people have to ask in order to get their money from CC companies. Basically they paid their money if they want to ask let them Ok kids, * Refunds: If you can't tell by the way they've not been addressing them, we're not getting them. A refund on a project like this is an all or none prospect as all these parts have to be purchased in bulk so if half the people are refunded the remaining people won't get anything. Logistically that's one reason for them not to refund, another is they simply don't want to. That's well within the KS guidelines for them opt to do (or not do in this case). You can not request a refund from Kickstarter. They do NOT issue refunds. We're on our own and there is nothing in the KS terms of service that offers us any protection at all nor is there anything in there to punish creators of scam projects or failed projects. Honestly because Kickstarter doesn't want to be in the business of playing judge and jury trying to decide who attempted to do it and failed nobly (there is risk involved in ANY ks and sometimes stuff doesn't work out as planned), or if they merely took the money and ran (which I've had a couple kickstarters do as well). Rico Serrano mentioned a charge back; if you have a bank that will issue chargebacks on transactions from Mar 16 2017, some 7 months ago, please do tell us the name of the bank here so I can sign up. For the majority (read as "all") of us, that simply isn't an option. In the interim, all this talk of charge backs from over half a year ago are like people threatening to call the FBI because walmart won't take back an item without a receipt. TLDR: Refunds & chargebacks: They ain't happening, so let's move on. On the slight chance that there is some sort of refund; then I guarantee it won't be the full amount as they've doubtless spent a great deal getting this far in the process. What a suprise, another useless update. REFUNDS.... HOW ABOUT ADDRESSING THAT???? I’m sick of these BS excuses. I have been waiting patiently for a long time for y’all to post something good but now it seems more and more worse. Please give me a refund This is the first time I backed something on kickstarter despite hearing horror stories. I thought this product actually was great and close to being released. Please refund those who want a refund. I want one, but doubt I will get a reply. Chargeback might be my only route. Unless someone wants to go the class action route. I agree with David Willford. So let’s hope for some useful information along with a timeline. So will tomorrow’s update be a good one? I doubt it will as the past ones were sad and as they’re all quiet there probably won’t be any good news. Start replying to your backers so we know what’s going on and get your shyt together. I say we all start blasting these clowns on social media so everyone knows about these scam artists. Repeated inquiries from lota of backers keep getting ignored so must be something to worry about. I wholeheartedly echo what @John said below... Hey ESTI, It's been about 2 and half months since your CTO debacle, that is significant amount of time for you guys to regroup. With that being said, please provide a detailed time line of your activities, projections and production. I've stayed quiet with your lack of substantial information your last couple of updates, but I'm losing my patience. You've had adequate amount of time to get your shit together by now. You don't want to have another chargeback pending... I have sent a message to you already, in addition to email last month. I would like to get my money back else I will attempt dispute of charge. I understand the challenges you must be experiencing, but either start issuing refunds or give an actual timeline. When will I receive the item, now it is mid oct, please perform a refund urgently. I received an email saying you are ABOUT to sign a contract with manufacturer, by the time we receive it will be the launch of iPhone XI. I NEED A REFUND, no negotiation. A few more days until we get another update. Here’s a guess “We haven’t got a final design” “We don’t know when these will be released” “We actually have no idea what we are doing” “We’ll skim over the thousands of posts asking for a refund” “Another key member has left the project” “We’ll give you another generic ‘update’ in two weeks” I would like a refund. The delivery date is past and you have not provided a new delivery date, so I will provide 72 business hours before I contact my financial institution. Thank you. I would like a refund I feel as though I have waited long enough and that you are failing to keep your word on this prospect Once again you log in for sh*ts and giggles with no reply to questions nor even a tidbit of news as next Sunday is Update which the way the past updates have been I am sure this one is going to suck as well. Is it to damn hard to tell us if your starting from scratch and redoing the Eye case and if your not when in the hell are you going to start production and whatever else you should be giving us. If you would give us better updates and communication we the backers would be so hot with you. Am not interested in refund gimme that Damn case at the earliest List give an answer then we get the god dam case ! That is what I want to know about ! Hi. U cannot give us any details or whatsoever!! Can U at least tell me how the heck Can I change the postal address!!! 1 of the lousiest Kickstarter Public relation ever PLEASE STOP IGNORING PEOPLE'S REQUEST AND QUESTIONS ABOUT REFUNDS. I would also like a refund please, your updates are total nonsense. Please tell me how to go about receiving a refund. Hi again like the other i think that u had enough time....estimated delivery august 2017 we are in october and there is not a schedule on when we’ll have that eye inour hand...today is my brother birthday,that smartcase was a present for him...i ask u again for a refund I’ve waited and waited... hoping you guys would release detailed information related to the development of the product... I think I have waited with patience long enough. I would like my money back. Hello! Due I don't have an iPhone anymore, please, make a refund. Backer number 2007. Thank you in advance! Everybody really lost the hope ! The cases is not going make until next year! Halloween is coming they will be have reason to say “ oh ! We are need days off on Halloween “ then next moth is coming November ! Thanksgiving is coming “ we will need to go shopping “ then days off ! Then the next Next moth ! December is coming “ oh shit Christmas is coming! lol need days for holiday! Then .............2018 ! Maybe can deliver! Its so long ! Its so so long time to wait! We been waiting so long ! on many tech stuff on kicksterter.. we wait more than 1 year... sooo noobs , it‘s a normal thing ,) I know that I am wasting my time typing this but what are you all going to do as far as software?Android 8.0 Oreo has been released. To anyone looking for a refund, we are all screwed. This is an email sent to me by them... ESTI Inc. says: Hi Carl, We understand your refund request for the money you have paid for the SmartCase campaign. The KICKSTARTER module is based on using the raised money to develop an innovative product and deliver it to the backers and then to the market. Such a model is irreversible. Your decision to support us is highly appreciated and we are doing our best efforts to make it as good and as fast that we can. We are happy that we can say that we succeeded to operate very thin, so far and we are managing lean process to make sure that you will get a quality product. We have to admit that due to wrong and too optimistic original road plan, the project completion will be quite much longer. We can assure you that we are doing everything that in our power to accelerate it . Regards, ESTI team It better start the refund process, I'm replacing my iPhone 7 with the new one x, what I will do with this order now? You should stick to your timeline or cancel your project....Right? At this point i want my money back...i don’t really care about your partnership...u had a timeline...cmon lets start the refund Another useless update. Update us on the SPECIFIC PRODUCT. The progress on development, not your partnerships. Provide a proper update with photos of the process. When you order it for the iPhone 7 and have to switch to the iPhone 10 due to production time lol you took too much time. I originally purchased it for my iphone 6 now iphone 8 is in market.. I want my money back . plz refund. I know my self that i am wasting my time right now to type these comments in my phone, because you guys never gonna open these msgs or reply back !!! I am so disappointed My first and last Kickstarter project !! If my product is not delivered by October 14, 2017, which is an ample amount of time then I request my money back due to failure of meeting agreement previously discussed with my investment!! what options do we have since this looks like vaporware at this point? chargeback credit card? I agree that this update is not a true update. From previous updates and communication, some more work needs to be done before entering into production. What we are looking for is update in this area which is of true meaning to the supporters. I think the point of contact for a class action would appropriately be in the location of jurisdiction for this case. This is just pitiful, you have a total of between Kickstarter $659,531 and Indiegogo $775,370 about 1 million 500 thousand (give or takes few nickels and dimes) and your STILL looking for a company to build these damn cases??? So these cases aren't even built yet?? Christmas is just around the corner and China or wherever get HIGHLY busy and if orders aren't given by October or November they aren't making it on the shelves for people to buy so I'm guessing these cases may not be sent out until next year if that and by then the iPhone 9 or whatever it'll be called will be out later next year. Nexpaq had software issues I guess and they're given refunds back but you haven't even done that yet little lone made the cases. Anybody going to make something should've had common sense before the backing was done was to seek electronic help on how long this would take and etc and your NOW to a point getting to this stage?? Time to start a class action lawsuit against this company. Does anyone want to volunteer for the point of contact for this. I am speaking to lawyers in the Titusville FL area this week. That's not really an update. Please include something about timelines/progress of actual development next time. Thanks! I have been pretty optimistic and yet to make a comment or say any thing, however you keep pushing the dates back I understand having issues with people and so on but you seem to not understand that when people ask for updates we are asking for updates on the product not your hiring or people. I would for a wireless carrier and have seen a case just like your product now am on the verge of just pushing for a return or funds and buying that. I invested in you months ago expecting it to be released when you said I wasn't mad when you pushed it back it's technology I am however upset that I feel as though you are feeding me and other backers false promises and lies at this point. We aren't seeing any true progress. You wanted to build a product with the help of our funds yet you can't seem to keep up with any promises you made to us at the start. That's not a fucking update!!!!! That could have been put out as an email and has nothing to do with the case at all. So today is Update day and I'm hoping there is good news and not introducing new members as you are past due obviously for the September release. If I knew it was going to be this hard to get this item out when it sounded all you needed was funds I wouldn't of backed this product. You supposedly paid someone to answer questions but yet have I seen replies in the comments section and getting an email took two weeks to get and the last email was sent on 9/17/17 and have yet to get a reply. I was thinking of getting this case for every iPhone I get but with lack of communication other than every two weeks a person is better to get the case if it ever makes it to the store and pay the heftier price. Waiting for another joke of an update. I think you should do the right thing and offer backers the ability to request a refund. By the time you ship the product it will no doubt look dated anyway. If we ever see it that is... If my product is not delivered by October 14, 2017, which is an ample amount of time then I request my money back due to failure of meeting agreement previously discussed with my investment!! No quiero que sepan que su nuevo empleado, donde ha trabajado, porque no me importa. Sólo hay que conocer la información sobre el producto, cuando las mercancías de la nave o cómo recuperar mi dinero. Creo que todos piensan así. por traducir la aplicación Não quero saber quem é seu novo funcionário, onde ele trabalhou, porque eu não me importo.

Acredito que todas as pessoas pensam assim. traduzir por app لا أريد أن أعرف من الموظف الجديد الخاص بك، حيث عمل، لأنه لا يهمني. أنا فقط بحاجة لمعرفة معلومات حول المنتج، ومتى يتم شحن البضاعة أو كيفية الحصول على المال مرة أخرى. أعتقد أن كل الناس يعتقدون ذلك. ترجمة التطبيق 私はあなたの新しい従業員は、彼が働いている、気にしないので人を知りたきます。 私は、商品に関する情報を知っている必要があります商品を出荷するときまたは私のお金を取り戻す方法。 すべての人々 がそう思うと思います。 による翻訳アプリ Je ne veux pas savoir qui est votre nouvel employé, où il a travaillé, parce que je n’aime pas.

I just need to know the information about the “eye”, when to ship or how to get my money back. I believe all backers think so. @ESTI Inc... Please limit the updates to the product design, production and timeline... We are NOT interested in your recruitment efforts and contracts signings. 답답하다. 언제 출시 되는 겁니까?. 품질 좋은 물건을 출시 하고 불안감을 해소 시켜 주세요. 이런 나쁜놈들아 Three days til update and there better be a substantial update with when this is going to ship and what's with the silence since someone was hired to answer questions and etc but yet not a damn peep. Is there to change the shipping address for our order? I am not able receive packages until after October, since my apartment is not ready until then. Can i change my pledge? Iphone 7 casing to 7plus casing?? So I see you logged in but yet didn't answer questions on 9/24/17. You are getting highly sloppy in not answering questions posted on here. As far as this coming Sunday there better be some highly good news as your starting production and shipping dates are "*". Hi I've sent you a few messages about wanting to switch my pledge to one case instead of the 2 that I originally pledged for since I got the Note 8 instead of the iPhone. My bf is still getting the iPhone X and he doesn't want the 4G capability, I just want to get 1 regular case and I'll use the extra pledged money for other accessories. Can you please retun my pm please. I also need to change the shipping address as well. Thanks! 私が思っていたよりも納期が遅くなりそうですね。ここまで遅くなると思っていなかったので一旦７＋で予約したが、私は電話をiPhoneXにと考えていますので、予約内容を変更して欲しい。 Many of us are proud supporters of your enterprise and efforts. Your's is not a retail endeavor in common terms. Stay the course...for each negative there are many of us who are patient. I got told by them today that it will not ship before Xmas . And no clear answer when it will ship I've sent few question regarding "postage address change" by email and they didn't even bother to give me an answer about this!! This pledge was worst spent money!!! Awful communication!! Wtf!!!! The customer service is really poor / zero not professional unlike when they want us to fund , Everyday there will be reply , after fund get already. No reply except the 2 week of crap update What if still no manufacturing update ? What can we do ? Come the next update which should be October 1st there better be tandem information like when manufacturing starts and other things because this crap is getting old. There is no news when the manufacturing beginning I need my money!! Will he 7+ case fit the iphone 8+? If I want to change my phone how do I go about changing my pledge? I would like to cancel my pledge. I pledged for a product that was stated to be delivered by August 2017. I am now requesting for you to refund my pledge due to failure to meet original campaign commitment and lack of useful information due to us as your stake holder. Anton, I believe that's already built into the case hey guys one. q: lot if people use magnetic car holder like tetrax or clutchit and we glue some piece of metal to tge case normally - can you build something like that in the eye case please? I need to change my mailing address as I've moved this week. Creator, please contact me. Thank you. This is ridiculous. GIVE US AN UPDATE ON THE PRODUCT! Maybe I should call the number of the person in the update you collaborated with in order to get updates on the product. That's apparently going to be the only way to find out any specific information about this case. Yep others have said it stop telling us who your employing to do something that should have been sorted and show us something solid like the progress of what we paid for and not the new staff of your business Poor show fellas these aren't updates these are staff newsletters hi, I cannot open the link for changing the model of phone. What is the use of this update? All the talk n talk , we want to see progress n photos of production. All this looking for Consultants, sourcing for manufacturing partners n etc should have been done during the crowd funding process , not waiting until now . All the certification need to be submitted to the relevant approving authority n if it was done before the funds start to come in , now the production should have started at least mid phrase or close to the end. I want my refund back as I do not see any actual production of the product Til date . I suspect that the technical officer who left brought away how to build, that is u now it is starting from the scratch Here we are two weeks left in September and we ain't got sh*t to let us know where you are with production other than just dragging us along with useless updates. Can we get a "REAL" update with production pictures, assembly pictures, testing pictures and etc along with when shipping date is along with tracking numbers please? Unfortunately, this update continues to not provide even a rough estimate as to when I'll be able to breathe some additional life into my ailing iPhone 6. I will not be getting another iPhone when this one finally goes belly up, so the Eye will be utterly useless to me once that happens. Of course I pretty much doubled up my pledge level with extras, which is just more money to be out if this is never delivered or is still months away as seems to be the likely best case outcome. The update is better than nothing for sure! Hope next update includes info about production coming up and some dates. We need the case mass production videos and pictures update ! Can you install apps on plugged in memory for android devices now? I had to root my early android device to do it. I'm hoping that this Sunday 9/17 will bring a better update to where you are right now and when this case will truly ship so I can buy my 200 GB memory card and install some apps so please give us a very good update and nothing like the previous updates. I still believe you guys will deliver this product and it will be great I've been waiting patiently these guys will come through because at the end of the day when people get there cases it's going to be a hit more people are going to want this case there's more money to be made and a lot of satisfied customers Hey so you guys sent an update with a link to give you information to what iPhone we where getting so you can send the right case when the case was ready to be sent out I went to the link opened the survey but it didn't give me the option to choose high case I needed please get back to me when you can with a reply Can I get my refund please? This is my final warning to ESTI. I've talked to one of my close friend from Akin Gump law firm. This is your last chance to do things right. We'll give you 4 more weeks to come up with substantial plan and timeline. I'm not buying any of your bullshit any more. just send the prototype, im fine with that. i dont expect any of this anymore. very disappointment on you guys, those lie never ending. Im Indonesia and shame off you "Eye" No one is ever getting a product lol The reason people are asking for refunds is because cc companies require you to ask before they can start the process of issuing one. Therefore don't tell people to stop asking for refunds. This is a lot of money and they haven't deliver their end of the bargain. So if you want to be stupid and let them steal from you that's fine, I however won't be taken advantaged of! If dates where given it would be one thing. But we are getting videos that are old and are being past of as progress. Stop being delusional. Do Canadian customers have to pay duties and taxes? Can we still change our phone type? or get a refund? This would be interesting, charging two phones at the same time wirelessly! So I just received a message saying that my pledge won't be refunded, is it the same for everyone else or did anyone successfully have their transaction reversed? I have one question. Can I apply Eye case for iPhone 8 ? With all this delay I am surprised you have not made it clear, in writing that we will be able to re-select the model we will get our Eye for. Realistically, how many of us will actually have the same phone when the product is actually released. I look forward to your response. Everyone stop asking for a refund. Yes 100 dollars if a lot of money,but they give your money back that causes the people who stick with the project to suffer because Esti wouldn't have enough money to finish the case. I have a question. You said, when new iphone appers, case becomes new one. new iphone has wireless charging, can you be available? Refund I wish to cancel my pledge and request a refund. I thought the shipment is supposed to arrive to me on Aug. But it's Sep now. I want to know what is going on As mentioned, if you cant dispute with your bank, you're not gonna get a refund. kickstarter isnt a store where you can get a refund when you ask for it I wish to cancel my pledge and request a refund. Is there still a way to change what version you would like as I'm probably going to buy the latest iPhone when it comes out?? I would like to have a refund... how ? Vishal at KS we find ideas and get rewarded, so guess none of them would refund us. We risk by funding a project and we fund the idea and will be in of the first to have products. So am afraid we cannot get positive response from creators, but yes you can raise a dispute at your bank and try. Am still keeping hour on this amazing idea and guess they would update us something practical, fingers crossed <url>"updates" and they haven't fallen off the face of the earth yet, but really they're nothing. The YouTube video they shared is uploaded to Joseph's (former CEO/creator) YouTube channel and features him in the video...like what happened to him leaving? Or is the video not new? And--we were shown a completely different design a few weeks ago that differed a lot from the prototype, and this "new" video shows the original prototype design. But nah that's not confusing or fishy at all. guys give them a break damn. obviously their original estimate was way to generous i knew that when backing it. every kickstarter ive been on is never on their estimate except one. One was late by an entire year.... they are trying and it doesn't look like they quit yet. When can the production start ? Showing that video does not help . Need to show is the photo or video that it is in production how long it will take to complete the order in kickstarter before they proceed the order in Indiegogo They didn't even show it closely. We need the close up video of the updated video. @George - My thoughts exactly, the same case used as the initial "prototype." Total cop-out vid when they've already shown the design has changed. There seems to be no continuation of development, the video shown seems to be the same device use in the campaign, and quite different from the design concept shown in the last update. This further indicates that they are starting from scratch and trying to avoid any explanation. We seem to be ignored. And too much sweet talk going on. So today or tomorrow should be an update since Aug 21 was the last update posted. Let's see what will come of this newest update, let's hope good news as this is supposed to be sent out this month for me and last month for others which was a no go. They lost a lot of my faith. I put in today for a dispute. If it's successful then yay. If it turns out that this isnt a scam then i can back again on indiegogo Have you guys ever considered that he meant to say 3 - 4 months and that it was a mistake when he said "years". Remember that they are in Israel (? or somewhere in that region) and that English is not their first language. Mind you that the original targeted release date was August/September, so 3 - 4 months at the time of the posting (in April) would make more sense. If it is 3-4 yr , no point getting this casing . I want a full refund Highly disappointed in this project with the lack of communication and supposedly there was someone hired to answer the comments and questions but looks like that isn't happening. And what makes it worse and sneaky is from your main website on comments that someone asked about delivery and the creator said 3-4 years and no one from Esti has came on commented about that. By now if at all there should be some info as you had a team knowledgeable on these types of issues and show us how they're helping and give us when this damn case is going to be sent to the backers, is it going to be this year or as the reply to the comment 3-4 years? I can confirm Kirsten's claim about the comment. Joseph Savion aka the founder responded to DJ Owe with a delivery time of 3-4 years. The post is dated 4 months ago. Definitely scammy behavior. So when can u start the production? 1 month plus ago u say u start the production, now u say u sourcing for manufacturor We need a timeline n commitment when u can deliver the product. How.. delay ? What a surprise !!! I backed nearly 40 projects. 4 situations : 1• Scam (>10) 2• delayed not delivered yet (>15) 3• received with a delay more than 6 months (5) 4• delivered on Time (3) Now that you have delayed the shipment, the new iPhone is coming. Can you update my Survey from the 7plus to the new upcoming iPhone 8? Thanks Simone Not sure how true it is, but on the ESTI website a commenter asked when the cases would be delivered (this was in April) and Joseph commented at that time with an answer of 3-4 years....yet had a Kickstarter campaign going that said August/Sept? Idk to me this is getting more and more scammy. I'm just waiting for my CC company to finish the investigation now but looks like I'm getting my money back. Just go to www.esti.me and scroll to the bottom where the comments are. Seriously bummed. Think I'm going to turn around and order the Oaxis InkCase instead which is not nearly as exciting as this could have been. Hi, is there any update on a possible delivery date please? When hell freezes over, and you guys are able to ship, please send out another survey so that we can perhaps change our case type. The next iphone is coming out on Sept 12th. Unless you are successful with your credit card dispute, do not expect a refund. Definitely don't expect kickstarter to do anything. They changed their terms of service around 3 years ago that completely absolves them of all liability. See section 4 <url>’t know if you are aware what kind of Website Kickstarter is? This is not a shopping site, this is not like pre ordering something. You support the innovative and creative ideas and dreams of people. Ideas that probably non of you could bring to life. So what is your point when you want a refund? Backing a project is not just throwing money and getting the thing shipped ASAP. Maybe there was a lack of transparency and information in the past, but these guys are Humans! Show them some respect! So let me give you this advice: If you want a Product like it’s in the pockets and homes of 100k+ people buy it on Amazon ffs! With the release of Android O are the cases still coming with Android N? Also what will the case be able to upgrade to newer versions of Android as they are released? Dear creator the case send to be thicker than expected As usual, more delays. Shipping will be on. September ... September 2019 I am switching away from iPhone and no longer want/need this if it ever ships. Please refund my $129. ESTI I still believe in you despite all that's been going on. I appreciate the updates that's been giving. I will say that the case definitely gained some "weight" or better yet some thickness. I personally think it makes sense especially with all the features that are suppose to go in it. Do we like that not really but if it comes to look like the final product picture I'll be satisfied because it looks clean. I'll just see it as having a otter box phone case on it. If at all possible before the next bi weekly update can we get some dimensions for the eye case? A generated final photo of the white version as that was a color option? And a hint at the next goal you all are planning to accomplish for these two weeks. Thanks. Keep up the great work. Communication for updates have been on time. Had us a little scared for this update but delivered nonetheless. Thanks. Looking forward to great details soon. So by when do u think we will get our product. U said there wont be delays. But delays are all we have seen. Give us a proper timeline. And what if i want to change my model for the latest iphone. Coz of the delays i might buy the new one. What now??? I'll change my iphone7+ to Samsung phone. I want to refund. How can i do? Hi. I have chosen the case for iphone6s. Due to your delay, what if i change my phone to a newer model? Can i change my case to suit my model in the future? I guess they're not going to even bother to try to intellectually regurgitate the same garbage excuses for a third time. Yeah, well we're waiting but once again you have failed despite you logging in today. This report we would like to let you know that the design proceeding and hopefully in the next report, we will be able to share with you pictures/drawings. The new management is reconsidering if we currently have the best engineering and production teams or we need to choose one that will fit better. Since, no budget was expended for this purpose yet, this is the right stage to make the decision without negative affect on the expenses. We will give you more details regarding the decisions and the changes, during the next updates. No update? Wat happened every 2 weeks??? Hey! I want to give as much info. My speculation, like some other backers have said, that without the CTO, they decided to change the design from both models. We are all pretty uncertain which specific thing led to this change. This message they sent me contains confirmation about the design for the iPhone 7 plus (and lower models) and the delay of the shipping... which we knew already. ~ Hi Maties, (My name) Sorry for the late answer. Yes, the design of the iPhone 7 is also going to be implemented on the iPhone 7 plus. Regarding the shipping date: As we already reported during the last few bi-weekly reports, the original promised date had been made with very optimistic view of the process. Now that the company has a team with the required experience, we are trying to put in place, all the resources and the required timeline to complete the production and to complete the legal compliance. It is definitely going to be much longer than originally planned and we don't want to commit before we will have confidence regarding the new due date. We will keep you informed with the bi-weekly reports and will let you know the updated schedule as soon as we will have it. ~ Good luck ESTI and have a good day all the other backers Well there should be another update tomorrow Yep, it is Popslate 3. We are sorry but you are totally mistaken and there for wrongly excusing us. The SmartCase will be delivered. Yes, the original estimation for the time that is required to make a product from "proof of concept" into a product that is delivered from production with all the regulatory approval were too much optimistic and therefore the time line was set wrongly, nevertheless the money was kept and the amount that was spent until today was spent cleverly mainly on the design and in a careful way that leaves ESTI the ability to supply the product even if it will be made several months later than originally promised. ESTI is doing what ever it can to make sure that all the bakers will get qualified product as was originally promised. If during this time because of the delay you will upgrade your iPhone you will be able to get SmartCase that will fit to your new device. Since we are not yet sure regarding the completion of the process we are very careful not to set promises that we will miss again. We are working now to get to situation that will enable us to set due date and to give better updates. Regards, ESTI team For anyone who paid for "enhancements" to your case which were separate from the original kickstarter - such as extra memory. These charges are straight purchases, not part of the backer contract. If you cancel them, ESTI is required to refund your money. Since the product was never built, they can't argue this. (Suggested by my credit card company.) . Just cancel the add-on order since it wasn't delivered. @Oscar Simmons The updates and steps (design)which they are giving now should have been given when they got funded months back, still now they are able to deliver concrete road map to delivery posting delay updates now at the time of delivery creates bad image of giant scam @Oscar Simmons I completely agree with your comments. With that being said, I am a bit concerned about the emails that other backers have been posting. @ESTI It appears that you guys are going thru a restructure and do not have a time frame. However, can you provide us with something tangible and concrete. For example, what have you done thus far? You guys were able to provide prototypes to YouTube vloggers, which is a great sign, so from then, what progress have you made? My amexI printed this all out and there investigating the company so I was told as well refunded my Money. I think this was one giant scam. Of course who knows if they're even being honest about the staff changes as they've haven't replaced or deleted/added anyone in the staff section of the campaign page. Here's what I think happened. The original CTO, Menahim T. was the entire brains behind actually getting this thing made. They stated he left so he probably took every last spec of R&D, probably including the prototype, with him; and that's why they are having to start all over. @Oscar - If this is above average service to you I'm REALLY never funding anything here again. I've backed many Kickstarters and, frankly, most have been late, while a couple failed to deliver. For the later I've seen the justifiably frustrated and anger comments of backers. This is the first Kickstarter where backers posted negative comments before reaching the advertised release date, in this case Sep 2017. I understand the concern for limited updates and negative information in terms of restructuring in personnel, but all of this occurred for projected delivery. On the whole, ESTI is performing above the average of most Kickstarter projects I've backed by making changes before the proposed delivery rather than after. Also, the latest computer rendering shows a superior design to the original proposal. I to am not happy to hear about a delay, but even a layman such as myself realized ESTI presented an ambitious time line initially. I agree with other backers that consistent updates can alleviate many concerns. Still, I am happy to help back a great idea and look forward to receiving a high quality product. "Hi Jay, We never lied to anyone! As we stated,the company founder made a great idea into makeable product but he was too optimistic while estimated wrong the timetable to complete the product and supply it to the bakers. Regards, ESTI team" Of course, the reason they continued lying to us was hoping to get beyond the timeframe for a changeback on your credit card. Unfortunately, in the case of fraud, this is not a defense. Since they have done nothing, now is the time to refund the money. Criminals! Now they are announcing very long delay time....they never updated us in the beginning it's clearly a scam pls all those who can claim your money back It seems like these people even copy and paste their replies. I'm very done with this horse shit. Here's the email I got. Hi Kyujin, We fully understand the frustration that you are feeling. Still we can tell you that while our original plan on the time to market was not realistic enough, we managed to perform with minimum expenses so the plan to supply you with the product is ongoing and you will get it. Unfortunately it will be in a quite long delay. ESTI introduced you with its great product. While Joe, the company founder made a great idea into makeable product, he was too optimistic while estimated the timetable to complete the product and supply it to the bakers. This happened mainly but not only due to not enough realistic estimation to the timetable to build product line and to complete all the required regulatory procedures. Joe is building now, a team that can support him to make it happen. The only damage is the delay in delivery time. Regards, Sharon ESTI team I want to dispute the transaction on my credit card but my bank says it has to have been in the last 60 days. The charge posted in April, what can I do? This is the message I got . A different excuse every time We understand the frustration that you are feeling. Still we can tell you that while our original plan on the time to market was not realistic enough, we managed to perform with minimum expenses so the plan to supply you with the product is ongoing and you will get it, but unfortunately it will be in a quite long delay. ESTI introduced you with its great product. While Joe, the company founder made a great idea into makeable product, he was too optimistic while estimated the timetable to complete the product and supply it to the bakers. This happened mainly but not only due to not enough realistic estimation to the timetable to build product line and to complete all the required regulatory procedures. Joe is building now, a team that can support him to make it happen. The only damage is the delay in delivery time. So there only building a team now . Meaning it hasn't even started yet I got precisely the same email as Jay - word for word canned boilerplate. Kickstarter has a different view on this - it is not at all "irreversible." In cases of fraud, which this clearly is, it is up to the company to provide refunds to backers since ESTI is changing the contract. This isn't going to be a couple of months - we're talking about at least 6-9 months if they are communicating in good faith - which so far they haven't. Remember that a month ago everything was going great and we were going to be getting pictures of actual product ... a product which they now admit never existed. There can be no purer definition of fraud. I've contacted my credit card company and suggest that anyone who doesn't want to see their money flushed do the same. Hi Justin, Unfortunately, we can not deliver in September. As soon as we will know the estimated delivery dates we will update. Thanks That’s the email I got. Here is what I just received in my message inbox: Hi Jay, We understand your refund request for the money you have paid for the SmartCase campaign. The KICKSTARTER module is based on using the raised money to develop an innovative product and deliver it to the backers and then to the market. Such a model is irreversible. Your decision to support us is highly appreciated and we are doing our best efforts to make it as good and as fast that we can. We are happy that we can say that we succeeded to operate very thin so far and we are managing lean process to make sure that you will get a quality product. We have to admit that due to wrong and too optimistic original road plan, the project completion will be quite much longer. We can assure you that we are doing everything that in our power to accelerate it. Regards, Sharon ESTI team So this coming Sunday is the day for the next update, I am to that point I'd rather have an update every week since there have been none or barely any interactions from this so called Sharon person who was hired to reply to emails (haven't gotten a reply back from the email I sent) nor has this person replied to questions in the comments section. Granted this is not Amazon or a store you should have respect for your backers to keep them in the loop of how things are going. It is almost end of August and quests what, next month is September which is the supposedly shipment date for the cases. There bettter be good news and no BS like the reply someone posted in comments section: I received this email response: Hi Andrew, We fully aware to our situation and the backers upset As you wrote, we are now in a setback of the whole process but absolutely believe in our ability to complete the design process and deliver high quality product. Unfortunately, in this stage we can not estimate the delivery time frame. As soon as we can, we will share it with you. Thank you for your understanding Regards, Sharon ESTI team They haven't even logged or checked in here since the 6th. I hope Oaxis is planning cases for the next iPhones. They are the only 2nd screen case company that seems to know what they are doing. Just as reference - all of the same telltale signs here that backers of the Popslate disaster saw. I mean, PRECISELY the same. I caught on early and got my refund as a result - most others didn't. I think in this case it is pretty clear that this project is doomed to fail because the managers aren't being honest with their backers about where things are. They've know for quite a while they weren't even close to delivering anything - and continue to disseminate lies and half-truths to cover the lack of any real progress. This isn't a matter of being loyal or supportive - simply a matter of being stupid. This case isn't coming, ever. Not sure if it was always a scam, but it certainly is now. Hi, team. I just decided to purchase the new iphone 8 when it is released this fall. Will I be able to request a eye for that phone? To add a little bit to that @Luke Barton They answered the same question on my kickstarter with: Hi! You'll get the option to change your shipping address two weeks before the shipping. Which is not a very long answer but I guess any information is better than nothing... which isn't a good thing btw ....wonderful... Here's a response they gave an indiegogo backer... Hi Andrew, We fully aware to our situation and the backers upset As you wrote, we are now in a setback of the whole process but absolutely believe in our ability to complete the design process and deliver high quality product. Unfortunately, in this stage we can not estimate the delivery time frame. As soon as we can, we will share it with you. Thank you for your understanding Regards, Sharon ESTI team If they were passionate about the project they would be responding to our concerns in the comments. I have processed a chargeback with my CC company. Im new to kickstarter so have only backed a few projects but compared to others where I was shown pictures and detailed updates each month, Esti are the only ones with very vague and non detailed descriptions of what is going on. I have no faith left in this kickstarter and $200 is a lot of money for me that I am not willing to lose if they are not upfront with us backers on what is going on. <url>"incompetent" is totally uncalled for. How do you know that they're not on the right track? Do you have an inside guy at their offices we don't know about? You must be some big shot businessman to be talking this kind of shit based on your uninformed assumptions. Last I read, their update stated they're learning as they go regarding mass production. The update before that, they said they're on track to finish by September. Hey backers! I personally appreciate all the feed back you guys/gals are posting. I'm gonna play devils advocate. Majority of the comments are valid and concerns that I personally agree with but some I think is a bit much. Those prototypes we've seen mostly sealed the deal for us all I think is safe to say. So being pissed with Esti is 100 percent understood. However I agree with @johnliu. These past updates have been minor and many may say substance less. But the were on time. This case is possibly the best thing that happen to iPhone that Apple didn't create so it was a bit optimistic with what they are offering us. So I believe it's gonna take some time after the mishaps within the company to get things on the right path. The way I see it. I pray that it gets done and would be happy with it as a Christmas gift at the latest. @John Liu I don't know what your intention is, but I'm not here to make a charity. I have no intention on babysitting a buch of incompetant so called entrepreneurs. Business is business, and no, the youtubers mean nothing to me. I don't care if they paid thos youtubers to make the review on those crude prototype or whatsoever. All I'm asking for is my fucking product, and it doesn't seem like they are on the right track. No bullshiting, what's not been done hasn't been done. We have every right to yell at these guys. They better post at least a video of the actual working product next time. And 2weeks? Does anyone honestly think thats a short time? I guarantee in 2 weeks we'll hear more about what they underestimated, what they were over optimistic about, and maybe next time they'll have something more concrete. @John Liu - it's really not a matter of things not being good enough. It's they are not at all what they said they were. Before funding they said they had been working on this case for 2 years and they completely ready for mass production, they just needed money. The last 4 months have been anything but that. Its just been one excuse after another and if they cared at all about their backers they would be actively engaged here in the comments section, not popping in every 2 weeks to say "we said we're gonna talk every 2 weeks so here we are, see you next time when we won't say anything meaningful either." Maybe $200 doesn't mean much to you but it's a lot of money for most, and many have the right to feel they've been mislead. They said they were ready to bring this to the masses. The more time passes with no news the more their budget slims regaurdless of what they say. It will get a point where they can't fulfill anything, just like popSLATE. I No matter what ESTI posted in their update, there'll always be detractors. If it was a written update, people will want drawings and pics, if they posted drawings and pics, they won't be good enough for some. If they posted a bunch of circuit boards they're working on, someone is gonna scream SCAM. Some want an actual timeline, production dates, etc. No matter what, someone won't be satisfied. Let's take a look at the positives of what we did get. We got 2 independent reviews on YouTube of a working prototype. We got a computer rendered final design. We were told that they undergone a staff change. We were proactively told of a delay in the case. Some of it may not be great news, but it's better than no news or communication at all. Let's give these guys a chance to work on it. If there's another delay... then voice your opinion and ask for a detailed inside track on what's going on. Keep it up guys! I'm not refunding either... But I actually hope they get their shit togheter in the next post! Come ESTI!!! This is the second expensive tech project I feel like I've been duped on. The first being Truu headphones... remember those? lol. I like to support these endeavors because I am a creator myself and like to spread positivity and give a chance to small companies... not because I have a lot of money to blow. ESTI.. please give me a refund. I might have to leave Kickstarter if this project doesn't work out as well. All I ask for is either serious documentation and project progress, or my money back. None of this "we are doing stuff I promise" BS. Kickstarter should really review this project. Looking at the update, basically update to tell us there is no update. I'm filing a refund for my credit card. @Backers just send request to your credit card and reason that you do not get the product as promised. Send your pledge details with delivery month as evidence to your bank to get a refund. Will take a few months but it will do the job. Even I believe and love the concept so am not going for a refund but would wait and believe in you guys I just hope that this case will arrive before Christmas. :) I want my money back. Never crowdfunding tech item again. Worst mistake. "This is an actual update. We promised we will update you, so here is the update: We will update you in two weeks" Get your act together guys please. I’m not gonna refund my pledge! I still believe in you guys! This is an absolute joke Thank you kickstarter and esti worst experience and biggest mistake in my life to backup you guys So, I’ve been quite pacient, like everyone else. But I’ve bought two cases. This is starting to sound like a joke. Does anyone know how to cancel this backup? In this time frame, by now it should already be in production and be shipping in 2/3 weeks top! On July 23, 2017 this is part of what was said on update #16..... In the next updates, we will share with you also tangible data, such as: pictures, videos, etc. What happened to the tangible data like pictures, videos, etc that was promised from the last update to be included in today's update? I am hoping next update will show tangible information such as pictures (not sketches), videos and when the shipping will begin or I'll be contacting my bank as lack of communication and replies from this so called person you supposedly hired to fix the communications issue of this project. how do i get my refund , will contact my banks Welp, tried to be patient with this project. Will be requesting a refund in the morning. First time I had to do this for a project. Oh well... I think we all see the next update coming - <url>"we're working hard, the company structure has changed again and we'll update you with the same generic BS in two weeks". It's an absolute farce and one is like to walk away from as soon as possible. Getting my refund now Beyond done with the false updates and promises of more. There isn't going to be more, people. I'm reaching out to my bank today, luckily they don't have a policy against crowdsourcing charge backs so I will likely get my money back. Drawings? When we already know what the prototype looked like we're getting drawings when stuff was supposed to be near shipping? Ridiculous. Guarantee those drawings will never show. In two weeks we'll get another "next time!" Please Esti... Stop with the bullshit... Just give us an " Actuall" but I mean an *ACTUAL* update! Thanks for the non-update team. You have provided us NO information about the product itself. I'm getting tired of this. This is a joke... Sorry but this is no update as some backers have said. As it is August you should have at least a few units done and perhaps electronics in them to test before full mass production. So August 20th should be pictures and videos NOT drawings. As far as refunds backers wanting refunds you should contact your bank as remember Kickstarter is NOT a store like Walmart, it's a place where people have dreams and bring them here to hopefully make them come true. So by the next update you should have all case(s) done or by end of August and ready to ship or get ready to drop ship to cities and countries to ship to the specific bakers in their state and country. It is amazing the number of people who do not understand how kick strater works. @Sameer and @ Rob Anderson My first backed project and probably my last � Although I appreciate the update, I would like to know how I request a refund. I have absolutely no faith that this product will ever be released and would like to get out. Senior team members leaving/fired, limited updates with very generic information and now questioning if you should change your engineering team. Please let me know how I can get a refund. While an update should be today, please control yourselves and don't start raging if you don't see it right away. If 8/7 hits then you may proceed. If you'd read updates 14 and/or 15 you'd know. There will be an update tomorrow as they said they would start posting updates every two weeks as promised starting tomorrow. Where's my case? Hope we see some good things over the weekend ESTI. So considering that article is 5 months or so old can't help but to wonder regarding the LTE, Google approval and Apples MFi and if calls work with the unit as there was no real calls from the video posted along with the two YouTube bloggers there was no calls to and from it along with the person so called hired to answer comments and emails which I have yet to see this person reply to comments on here unless I missed them. Also curious on what type of 200 GB memory card a person should get as I've seen different types or will any 200 GB card do no matter what. Let's keep our fingers crossed to see if they actually do an update. They said 2 weeks. the next update should be on the 6th. Which is a sunday so maybe the 7th @Kyu Jin Shin Calm down. they said that they would update every 2 weeks its only been a week since that last update. Most companies outsource for certain parts to make money stretch. And you are trying to outsource OUR PRECIOUS PRODUCTS to cheap ass manufaturer in fucking China! Come on guys. We backed you so you can manufacture them by yourselves with the best quality. You did everything that can be done to fuck up your business. Keep your shit together, PLEASE! You guys are complete rubbish. All you've been doing was giving fake and empty promises and giving excuses for your incompetence. You were supposed to update us at least a week ago and you still won't do it, let alone giving any substatial proof that you actually have the final product in hand. I've done business myself for many years and have never ever disappointed my supporters and customers like you guys. You having HR problem is YOUR problem and that cannot be the reason to postpone the promised date that you initially offered to your backers and we all know you have more than plenty of finance backing you up. Obviously you guys lack of competence and respect to your customers. I seriously regret putting my money on YOUR ASS to fuck up my precious time, money and expectation. I will never recommend any product from ESTI whatsoever to anyone I know. Great job guys, you guys are by far the worst Start-up company that I know of who managed to raise hell lot of money just to disappoint your backers. I was browsing the internet and found this Forbes article. You should read the update on the article. <url>#3d8cf23f79dc Hope that there's an update on the developments soon. @Sameer Sharma I'm not sure if you misread my comment or your response got lost in translation, but I fully support ESTI and in no way do I think they're a scam. They may have computer generated pics, but they also sent the prototype to 2 different tech YouTubers for an unbiased review. When shipping? I mean well Sameer they have android on eye and it was show cased will in prototype @John Liu & @Shawn That case on Alibaba is no better than what we have here. 1. It features computer generated images so we dont know how it looks like in reality. 2. The images show IOS on the secondary screen. Im 100% positive that a 3rd party device cannot run IOS... so its positively a SCAM. Im on the edge too but in the spirit of KICKSTARTER and as its backers... lets give ESTI benefit of the doubt and see what we learn in the next update. Goodluck ESTI... Make us proud !!! August is 1-2 days away and next promised update is the 8/6 so hopefully we all will see better pics and videos amongst other things @Shawn I'm pretty sure I know the case you're referring to on AliExpress and I can tell you don't bother ordering it. It's garbage. I brought it and returned it in a day. It doesn't even have the Play Store and there's not enough RAM to run anything other than chat apps. Is this the one you're referring to? <url>"whoops sorry, we will update more soon!" and a final product image which is great but not at all what anyone was asking for �� I will give this another 2 weeks to see what happens on that update. And if there isn't a REAL update, I'm done. I have almost lost hope for this project, 3 months in and no actual development updates or pictures of progress. I will give it till the end of Autumn for a proper update and if this doesn't come I will be processing a charge back. Thank you for the informative update on the newcomers to the project. I look forward to seeing what you guys accomplish. I hope you can keep the 2 week updates coming. Hopefully in two weeks we can see some pics of the finished product. I am not so familiar with current Android development, but I am hoping to use this as a hotspot when I travel, this way I can keep my iPhone SIM and add wherever I go. Guess esti is coming in right direction and i love the final referred design, all the excitement seems to be coming back, waiting for more substantial updates Worrying about the new update. From experience, it sounds like the key technical person has left the project, other people are being brought it to try and continue. Normally if a project is only part of a company's business, we should not be hearing about the administrative part would be transparent to the backers, rather substantial project progress. Certainly hope things go well. So since someone has already been hired they should be replying to questions on comments section then right and Pics showing progress should be posting as well right? Looks like there was no response from @creator. I'll be filing my chargeback tomorrow. @creator, I find it hard to believe that you have to hire someone that is new to the project to explain what is happening the the project. It sounds like you are hiring someone just to sooth some feather here, which is really a waste of backer money. If people on the project cannot spend a man-hour a week to log some progress, then you have a problem. Yo can I change shipping adress? As a techie I actually understand that AMOLED screen are hard to come by right now as apple is buying them all up, but do to change in date I womt been in us anymore but in isreal how can I get shipped there @ Solomon. call your bank and tell them you're disputing a charge from April 15th for X dollars. They will take you through the entire process. If I don't get a substantial update with details on the product development by FRIDAY I'm reporting this project and filing a chargeback with my credit card company. I have until Saturday to file it. This is ridiculous. I honestly want to give you guys the benefit of the doubt, as I'm sure this is a challenging project and may be a bit overwhelming, IF we see something beyond words in the upcoming week. Show us, in pictures, what you guys have accomplished so far. Explain to us why when you have a fully working prototype all of a sudden development and tooling issues arose, shouldn't the prototype have been the R&D phase of this project? Does a production model of the case even exist? Tell us when you honestly expect the AMOLED screen issue to be resolved. Even successful companies like popSLATE that had great 1st run iPhone cases faltered during version 2 of their case/crowdfunding and they had to file for bankruptcy and the vast majority of their backers were left with nothing. So you have to understand our concerns. PLEASE give us some tangible proof that the project is successfully moving forward. I appreciate the update and response, but once again it offers very little to no substance. Just more promises. The said part, is that this setup is very doable as visualized in the protype. You take the guts of an android phone and custom print a case and the add the connectors. I'm hopeful that the creators did not get too ambitious in the features with the wireless charging and metal mount, all of which could hinder apple mfi approval. The next week or two will be interesting. Although, I'm afraid that most backers have now went past the 90 day dispute period and will get nothing in the end. Thanks for the response and all the best creators can't wait to see the finished case :) WTF is happening � Could someone please tell me how to file a dispute with the credit card company and what to claim the dispute is about thanks a lot! @ creator: You have completely ignored your backers and continue to evade all questions regarding the status of the product. There is no credible update to where the development of the product is and when it can be expected. I know you and I spoke about a 500 unit order a few months ago and I'm glad that I did not order it upfront for my employees. I have now disputed the charge for my order with my credit card company and you will hear from them. Cancel my order, immediately. What gets me is they logged into their account but yet no replies to the comments. I was going to get a case for whatever other iPhones I get but now I'll just stick with other cases since the lack of updates and communication. To make a backer happy and not concerned is with comments and updates with Pics and video to show how the campaign is going. Yes granted there was a real prototype given to a few real ppl who have their own YouTube channels but updates with progress gives us faith of the project, a tad bit disappointed. With the complete lack of updates and communication, I have serious doubts this will come about. More than likely the next up date will have more manufacturing/quality delays. Followed by a "the last guy took off with the money" and we have no way of completing the project. Glad I got a dispute in with my card in time, and if they fail to deliver by August I have been assured a refund from my credit card issuer. Checked with the bank and realized I didn't use the card, so I went to the credit card and learned it's too late to back out so I'm really hoping for the best I truly hope by end of this month there will be Pics and videos of the progress of this device as I wish you would now so I could get my 200 GB at a cheap price and my SIM card but since there are no pics and videos showing progress I'll just have to sadly wait. Cant wait for this case to come out, its gonna be really cool. Good jobs guys! Hi I am a backer and I need to change the mailing address due to the delay. Can you let me know how do I change the mailing address? This was a challenging project from the start, I would not mind sacrificing the wireless charging to get the rest of functions. But I think providing true situation info on the project itself is much better than telling us about administrative issues. This also helps keep some trust and confidence for the whole Kickstarter community. Sav Joe Sav Joe7 months ago We'll launch in a month from now If the campaign will succeed it'll be shipped in July 17' <url>"Can either SIM be used as a hotspot for the iPhone to communicate with the internet? Is it through the internal connection or wirelessly?" @CeKWg I didn't get upset, I'm just letting people know that I've never heard of a bank that charges "you a big sum of investigation fee". You're saying things like "Most likely you will not get anything" and "The only thing may get is fee may even more expensive than the project itself", which you can't state as a fact. But in re-reading your post, I realize that English may not be your first language, so I'll just assume your intended message got lost in the translations. Can only hope these guys are genuine with what they're saying. Will there be a case for the iPhone 8? While we did get an update and NOW 2 months away from shipping we are not to happy as we have not gotten current pictures and videos on how work is going other than saying "everything is going well" without any visual proof just word of mouth. Some of us have backed other projects and those creators said the same as your saying now such as the Fuzure company who have failed to answer comments and ship the product and now asking for more money. So until you show us current pics/videos of the case we as members cant help but to think negatively. A good creator ALWAYS answers comments and doesnt wait weeks or so to reply they answer them with in a timely manner which a few weeks is not. So please make a better update with what us backers have requested and not "everything is going well". This is either a FAILURE project or SCAMMER on kickstarter Can we get some background on the supposed "New CEO" Eran Cohen? did any backer get email updated today 07/13/17 i did there is working hard on eye smart iphone @John Liu I don't know why you get some upset for what I said, I just explaining the process and tell people to be aware. I did said "SOME BANK" not all, so your bank is not included. Please do understand. and I didn't claim any fraud, so chill. Luckily we are 4500 odd backers and guess getting these cases amoled screens should not be a challenge and am willing to wait for the case. All the best creators but please do let us know things like is your case apple certified now, do share some pictures or status regularly as much possible. AMOLED are hard to get onto because apple is currently buying almost all they cna get their hands on Bamn!!! First delay update (and even threw in a founding member issue). Thankfully they dropped this while I'm still in the dispute period with my credit card. Filed a dispute right after the update, now just waiting for the response. Luke is right. Kickstarter got their money so they don't care. That's why scams are easy here. But eye still has time, they could be working on it and just suck at communication or just waiting for a big reveal, but it is all concerning still and a few red flags are raised. We just gotta wait for now. Not to be negative but Kickstarter won't do anything, your cards already been charged, and we're basically shareholders in the stock market. It could tank and we lose our investment. We backed an idea with no guarantees. Hi Backers, Could someone share "How to get KickStarter involved in an issue ?" If this is a scam, KICKSTARTER's credibility is also on the line. It really is getting fishy. I think at the first sign of a delay, people should start pulling out. I honestly want to believe them. They had a working prototype and they say everything is on schedule. However at this point communication has gotten really slow which is the first red flag. Then no real concrete/technical information about the project is a second red flag. Even a simple diagram could be good but not even that. So it definitely is concerning. The only trust we have or reassurance is word of mouth which is NOT how you run a business. So the first word of a delay would make me not trust you anymore, especially with nothing concrete to go on Wat happened to hiring someone very soon to keep us updated as promised in ur last update ? I hope this thing actually works and isn’t a pos tablet android that are 49.99 on sale. I just hope we hear something soon. @ESTI We are under 2 months away from shipments. Could you please share the pictures of the final product that will go into production ? I think that will ease all the backers (including me) and make up for lack of updates. In any case, I'm surprised that all these claim questions are starting to pop up all over the place and Esti doesn't bother to answer them... Hopefully there will be an update today for real. No updates from long time @Kenneth Seah It really depends on the amount and the relationship you have with your bank. I've filed 2 disputes with crowdfunding, one from Kickstarter and one from Indiegogo. The Indiegogo dispute was actually not found in my favor, but my bank refunded me because it was only $32. As for the one on Kickstarter, I'm not sure what happened behind the scenes, but I won my dispute and it still shows that I'm a backer on the campaign. All I can tell you is to file ASAP if you feel like the campaign is a bust, various credit cards and banks have different windows on how long you can wait to file. You can either file a fraud claim or a non-received claim, depending on the situation. For both of my failed campaigns, I submitted screen shots of the shipping dates and I claimed non-receipt of item. well according to that, there will be a progress update today so lets see If He can post an update in Indigogo, Why not post something here at KS too? I know their update is same our update from last month. At least show us some progress. Its already first week of July. Update today from indigogo: posted by Joseph Savion Jul 8, 2017 • 10:10AM 12 hours ago Split Shipment | ESTI Great news for those who backed us for multiple Eye Smartcases ! If you wish to receive one or more Eye Smartcases for the next iPhone and the other Eye Smartcases for the current iPhone models, now it is possible to split your shipment. Please follow up on the link to or re-visit the survey that you received. <url>"everything is great" what have you completed?, are AMOLEDs available now?, what does it look like?, are we still on schedule? Surely you have to understand why people are getting ready to back out. Even if you're busy you owe it to the people that made this possible to tell them something. Dear creator please let us know if you have completed apple certification for the case It looks like he has no problem replying to people on Indiego about survey after they give him more money, but nothing on the product itself... Guys I agree communication has been quiet bad but I still do not feel it as a scam but yes there would surely be a delay, creators share your progress in pictures before things go out of proportion please. Am sure you guys are working hard. Most likely you will not get anything, this project has update, communication and the deliver day not even close yet. The only thing may get is fee may even more expensive than the project itself. Not always work. Some bank treat crowdfunding website as non-refundable transaction Bank may give you immediately refund, but they will start to investigate the case. If they found out it is a crowdfunding project, most likely they will take the refund back and charge you a big sum of investigation fee. So beware, before report dispute please look over do the bank have policy against crowdfunding. What people can do if they are worried is dispute it with the credit card or bank and keep looking at updates. if it works out, you reback on indiegogo Hey, Just looking at the common Q&A, this is kick starters policy on refunds: ""Can Kickstarter refund the money if a project is unable to fulfill? No, Kickstarter doesn't issue refunds. Transactions are between backers and creators directly. Creators receive all funds (less fees) soon after their campaign ends." I new to this, does anyone have experience on getting a refund? I'm doing the same. This is ridiculous. Ive backed hundreds of campaigns and this has to be the worst level of communication I've ever experienced. At least with most other scam projects the creators had the decency to lie about the progress. And not just say "there's nothing to update". Have some decency and update us on the progress of the case. We have NO idea how far you've progressed. If we don't get some form of a real update (meaning pictures, video included) I'm going to file a claim with my CC company and suggest other people do too before time runs out and this KS steals your money. I've never been involved with a legit KS campaign where a month before delivery there are no legit updates or photos of the product. The scam ones are always like this. Just post one picture of the final product! This sounds already like an delay on delivery time Where on your updates are you mentioning this??? Cause every update I get says that you are working hard and very busy that's it . ....Not one update have we got about progress . Where you are with the project no photos with the final design no final product and we are only a month away from august . Can u just please give us a proper update so we no wats happening Come on guys!!! It is now July and delivery date is next month if nothing comes up. Can we please get a one massive update with the stuff us backers are asking you in an update. Granted you are busy making sure this is a class A product but yet you can't take time to give you backers/investors a reasonable update. So your telling your backers/investors you can't do an update that may take 5-10 minutes top after the days work have ended for the day? There needs to be some photographical evidence of an updated prototype that shows you have made progress past the prototype shown on Unbox Therapy 3 months ago And we get another pointless update... Could ESTI Inc. update us with photo of the progress and prototype ??? how much of the commitment qty is completed ?? i personally feel scammed so rip to me i guess? Hi indiegogo funds are inclusive of KS funds I guess I mean, between kickstarter and indiegogo you guys have funded over $1.4 million. It would be nice to see what this money is funding. The indiegogo campain also is asking for details. Some still didnt get surveys @Andreas, URL? This is my first time to join the kickstarter. However it seems to give me a bad experience from it. I really hope that I will get the product eventually. I have to say this campaign is beginning to be just like every other failed/scam kickstarter indiegogo campaign I've been involved with. Amazing communication during the campaign, then little to nothing up until delivery date (with every update being an apology about lack of updates instead of real information). inhighly suspect there will be some manufacturing or certification delay mid August pushing delivery back to December. This will go on until you're past the point of disputing the charge with your card. @Andreas that's worrying actually :( I see that you have also launched on another kickstarter site. On that site the Eye is cheaper, how come? I'm abit worried... I just sincerely and honestly hope this is real. I want this to be the best phone case for when I upgrade to the new iPhone that comes out. Please just let us know what's going on. This product is really challenging and I know people are going anxious. I have full faith on you guys please get this ready in the best possible form, do share some pictures of your in progress so people feel more satisfied. So July is tomorrow and yet no pictures or videos of the finished product and August (the deadline) is just around the corner. Even though you are very busy with getting this product out to the wild is great, however communication is the key to keep your investors in the loop as this project is sounding like Fuzures project of a 2-in-1 dual sim battery case as with the creators communication is lacking. I truly hope there are no delays as you said in a comment and update everything is going good and no issues. So PLEASE give us an update with some pictures and videos so we can see what the finished product looks like and please show us the app and how to videos to show us the under the hood specs. Hi ESTI Creator! Any plans to make an Eye case for iPhone SE in the future? Some of y'all REALLY need to chill. Let them work!!! Geez... Kenneth is correct again. You should already have at least one completed product that you could show us. Could we please get pictures or a small video of a functioning finished product please. We deserve this as backers. Hi, have you got a milestone? better for both of us as well as for project management. When can we see the final product? I doubt it take more than 1 hr to take a few photos of the final product n showcase the production. Hope my request is not too much or impossible to fulfill Hi. I backed the Eye wifi at $119. I would like to upgrade to $149 4G version. Is it possible by adding the extra $30? And where do I go about paying & updating my purchase? Also I already filled out survey, can it still be amended? Thank you. I'm honestly starting to question the validity of this as well. There's really been no update of substance since this was funded beyond "we have nothing new to report, and some parts may be delayed, but no worries. We cool?" We should really be able to see manufacturing, what parts you guys do have, something beyond just words. We haven't even seen what the final product is supposed to look like, except it's supposed to be way more premium than the prototype... seems unacceptable and very unprofessional. We deserve more than just words. Hi everyone, I am giving up my eye - 4g. Please email me at <email> if anyone is interested to have it. You also told us at the start there would be an update every 2 weeks no matter how big or small it was and all where getting is it's on time . We want proper updates pictures videos whatever stage you are at . If it wasn't for the people who funded this project u wouldn't be able to do it . Now I think u owe us that . So where are we with the project ??????? These vague updates are getting annoying. Stop pacifying us with "everything is going to plan". We want to know the details of the development. Give us a breakdown of what has been completed and what's yet to be done. Stop treating us like children. Hi, is it still possible to change to 4G version? :) I suggest to let backers know where the project you are at, like software camera testing, hardware re-design status that you promised to be changed, and issues/challenges, etc. hey when i get the 4g version eye case it has a sim card slot is it micro slim or nano slim? Can we swap to a case that has a SIM card slot??? Starting to feel like this is a scam. Out of all of the things I've backed, even the Luma Dice fiasco, there have been legit updates beyond saying you don't feel there's a reason to update. It doesn't matter how you feel, your backers, the people whose money you have, are requesting updates and getting nothing but statements of everything is fine or that you don't see a reason to update just to update. I agree completely with @Kenneth. Im honestly just going to keep posting until we get something of substance. Wats happening??? No updates. Before this got funded you clearly stated there would be an update every 2 weeks and that hasn't happened! You all so said you where going to employ someone to keep us updated and that hasn't happened either . So where are we with the project??? And when will we get an update??? Everyone's comments just keep getting ignored Could you please provide us with an update on the device. I understand that you are busy but I believe we deserve something to let us know what our investment gotten us. This is something that we no only want but we definitely deserve. Thank you for the future response. Basically just give us a legitimate update and we will be satisfied. Starting to wonder how legit this is considering there aren't any posted updates..... I have a question, can I use this device as a wifi sharing device to share internet connection? Ya looking forward to any sorts of update also... As we are indeed getting closer to the ETA... Alright guys, even though you said everything is running smoothly, which is good but is there any way to share some pics and videos of our cases you are making? I mean it's been 1 1/2 to 2 months so you should at least have some pics or short videos of the circuit boards or stuff like that. June is almost over with two weeks left and July takes over, hopefully you'll give an update the last week of June as today you checked into your account. Remember this is not a store, you are backing someone's dream. If you look back at comments and updates you will see that this device is supposedly on time for August/September delivery if things don't go in another direction despite the lack of communication and videos and pictures of the progress of making the case. How I will get back a full refund? Anyone can help? Maybe by mail or something like that? Thanks!!! Regards iPhone8, if this campaign is deliver as good as it should, I will support to the next Eye for iPhone8 for sure. Please keep your comment, then you will get our support in next project. I opted to wait until the new iPhone's launch and there's no add on. Although, there might probably be one if you decide to get a case for iPhone 8 later on. Looking at the latest updates of possible iPhone 8 made we wish I didn't click the above mentioned option. Was hoping for a smaller iPhone (like a thinner iPhone 4) with edge to edge screen. @creator I have no idea how this product is coming along. Please keep the lines of communication open and tell us what stage of development you are in. This product was an incomplete prototype when you were funded. Would like to know if all milestones were achieved and if you're on time for delivery. Thanks There is no way to cancel your order as you have committed to this project as this is not a store but backing someone's idea. As they stated one or two updates ago that things are on track for now and it's not suppose to be delivered until August or September as it says in each gift. Is there a way I could cancel my order Considering it is mid June and delivery is either August or September pending on which gift you chose and there are no hang ups to delay past the August/ September delivery date. I had a quick inquiry; I was wondering if there was any difference between the plus and normal size case. Since the plus model phones have larger batteries since they use up more energy, is there also a larger accompanying battery? A larger screen? If not, where is the extra space going towards? Thank you, and I can't wait for my cases to arrive! Speaking of, is there any updated estimated shipping date? how much longer will this be taking? and where can i know the shipping date? thanks Sorry it was not higher but if we marked "yes" for wanting to decide on the next gen iPhone should we change the option to that one or should we leave it alone Hello, I wish to wait for the new iPhone release however ... I found on the site (as i recently reopened the survey to check out the split shipping) that there is an add on that is to wait for the next gen iPhone however the price of that one is possibly higher than the original How much longer will this take? I still need to be contacted to order my colour It is nice to hear things are going well but not trying to get that fake page off ASAP can ruin it for you as people will think it's you and ruin it for you. And since things are going so well it would be nice if picture and videos could be posted since we have 2 1/2 or so months left. Can we get another Update? Is IR transmitter included on the EYE? or it is a Add-on I need to pay? Also guys, if you have a question thats personal to you and not something that general, its better to shoot them an email than posting it here.You probably have a better chance of getting a response that way @Philip, check Update #11 as this may be what your looking for @ESTI inc. Hello, I sent my survey few weeks ago and wanted to change it. How will i update that? I wanted to wait for the new iPhone. You should have a link to allow changes on the backers order while the EYE is not yet shipping. Hi, it has been a while since the last update. Do you have some news? Is everything on time? In wich part of the process are you? I think we all want to know something at least every 2 weeks or so. Hope you post an update soon. @creator can you address the link that @kenneth posted if someone selling Eye at very low pricing? How do you describe the price of the contents in invoice when you ship? That will change the amount of tax that I need when I receive it. I sent my survey in can I change it to the next iPhone. @creator - keep posting updates, However small they are. What's happening? What stage are you guys at ? Interesting. If it is being sold by @creator then they are selling it for 50% cheaper than the Kickstarter price. Doesn't that make me feel like an idiot... @kenneth seah yeah, looks like someone is trying to pull a fast one <url>#12, I myself would like to see an increase of the battery if possible (meaning if the battery is 2200 mAh increase to 2400 mAh and so on). I very much look forward to this case as this is a 2 for 1, Android and iOS together in harmony. I hope you make cases like this for ALL future iPhones as I would surely purchase one for the new one I get at the time, hopefully as well the backers will be notified via here (pvt. msg.)and email of an introductory price to all who backed this case. June is almost here so August is inching slowly. Will the 3.5 jack work with the iPhone or does it only work with the case? And also, will the case's lighting port work with iPhone lighting headsets? Indiegogo funds shown are inclusive of KS funding so guess we have not yet reached the goal Update please!! I doubt they're going to make it waterproof. It wasn't an option on their Indiegogo campaign. If you combined the amounts raised from both KS and IGG it would surpass the waterproofing goal from KS. Whoever asked about is it going to be waterproof here is your answer. Last thing: We'll do our best efforts to make the Eye smartcase waterproof. We know it's important to you guys! Are you going to do the case waterproof? Thank you update please I'd love me some shipping estimate updates! :) Hi, When can we expect an update? I assume you're busy these days and we backers like to be updated :) waiting for the progress update / photo update of the casing if can separate the delivery , i would consider taking a 2nd one , 1 for 1phone 7 plus another 1 for iphone 8 plus So when will "next few days" be as we're getting antsy wanting to see what the finished product will be and wanting to get our hands on this great device. Also I know iPhone 8 will be made but will other future cases be made as new iPhones come out? August needs to get here NOW!! Update Hi Esti, I got question. You mentioned that "Since Eye doesn't have a mic or speaker, it'll use the iPhone's own mic and ear speaker." How will the call quality be if we talk from the backside of the phone (using the case), but the mic and speaker are in front, since it is using iPhone's? Can you make your own mic and speaker instead? Regards, Deni Hi I'n campaign it stated that the cases wil be shipped with nougat has that changed now to marshmallow?? is it possible to upgrade to Android O? so many great features..... Yep i agree with Ibby, we would like to be updated on the current status of the device and expected time lines. Hi @ESTI, While communication has been lacking, I'm sure that's attributed to the fact that your team has been working hard. I'm just not sure what you folks have been working on. The last couple of updates have been about the surveys and there has been no mention of any form about what stage of development you are in, what progress you have made, and if you're on track to ship in the coming months. Can you please take the time to provide your backers an update specifically about the device and the timeline? Thanks. I ordered 4 units, What if I want to have three now and one later after the release of the new phone ?! Thanks Still haven't received my survey even after re-entering and certifying my email address. Moving to Israel aug 2017 need to change shipping address fro USA to Israel. How do I do that and pay for shipping cost to Israel? They are more likely to answer person questions if you email them. I had an issue, emailed them and it was solved within 4 days T I received the survey again. The problem is still the same. I want to make decision on one, but the other until the new phone is announced. This is not possible. It is also not possible to leave both decisions until the new iPhone comes out. Can someone explain what the survey is supposed to do? I'm a little confused on the when It will come to me if I click on the wait for next iPhone option. Also what if I want 2 6s cases and 2 iPhone 8 cases. Just hoping u can clarify it up for me. Thank you. when will the case start shipping? All excited to see there prototype thanks for the response esti team � If you did not receive your survey, check your email in your settings. Make sure your email that you put as your username is the same as your current one. I had the same problem. color change please Jet white → Jetblack Hey I've never gotten a email and re-entered my email on the website to have it resent and still there's nothing email in the past few days for me to fill out my information. Please help! Same situation with @andrey zykov! It wasn't clear that the one we pledge for has no cellular connectivity. For all we know it's just 2 sim card without LTE. There's still 3g and edge for sim connectivity. That's so unfait. Please clear this. I'm getting and iPhone just for this even if I'm an android user and without it having extra sim card slots is a big let down. Should have been clear in the beginning. Please help your backers. Thanks @Tyler Walker Thanks for the heads up!!! So two weeks have almost come and gone and no updates on how things are going, you have gone quiet which when there is no replies we tend to freak out thinking of the worst. You were always vocal when backing was still going but now nothing so PLEASE give us a heads up on how things are going. I'd love to know how close you guys are to Water Proofing. I was reading in the emails that followed the successful Funding that this was a top priority. FINAL PRODUCT ??? So far, in all the reviews, videos, pictures... its been said that its a proto-type and its not the final product. Now that the kickstarter concluded... Could we see the final product ??? If not now, when can we see one ? @Matt - now after receiveng a survey I've realised that only 4G models will be with cellular module, but before backing I've checked the detailed specification and found that Eye will be equipped with 2SIM card slots (without any notice that this is valid only for Eye 4G). The description is still available and we can see the following: "Eye includes 2 extra SIM card slots supporting LTE cellular speeds up to 300 Mbps." ...and after... "*Please check the specs below for full details on supported cellular bands". So, let's check the specs - again no any notice about Eye 4G and no any notice that cellular module is only an extra option. Moreover, in the rewards list you can see: “X1 Eye” and “X1 Eye without cellular connectivity”, but it is looks like at fact both these versions will be without cellular connectivity. But what is the difference between these 2 rewards in this case? Totally this situation is looks for me as a false representation. If you look under Esti's bio it says they last logged in on 4/19. That is terrible and makes me believe that they are a scam I'm sure you guys are swamped,but I must ask, I have my survey,probably will wait for next version of IPhone,my question is, when second survey for the waiting people comes,will we be able to add options then? Example,4g,64gb,and other add ons. I'm just not sure at this point and will know better when I see new iPhone once released. Thank you and the best to all of you. Once I hear from you ,I can then send survey,sent email too.......just waiting patiently......SN @ESTI Survey says: DO YOU WISH TO WAIT UNTIL THE NEW IPHONES LAUNCH AND THEN DECIDE WHETHER GETTING THE EYE SMARTCASE FOR THE NEXT IPHONES OR FOR THE CURRENT ONES? Important! YES means waiting with the shipping until November (which is a month after the launch). YES also means that we will not take into account the COLOR and iPhone MODEL you chose above. If you don't answer we take it as a NO. ------------------------------- So this is the 2nd request for me to answer my survey, but you guys still haven't answered my question! I ordered 2 4G Eye's 64GB and paid already. I want one for the iPhone 7 Plus and one for the new iPhone. THE SURVEY DOES NOT GIVE THAT OPTION!!! WHAT DO YOU GUYS SUGGEST??? I would very much like to complete the survey, but I don't want to be waiting till November for both of them!!!! Any suggestions?? It does say the Eye is ONLY for 6, 6S, 6+, 6S+, 7, 7+ not for anything lower I'm sure the original kickstarter post said it would be compatible with the iphone 5S??? I wouldnt have backed it otherwise. Now I dont see it as an option??? Sorry it's not bashers but backers @Andrey It was a little misleading, actually. When you read everything you realise that there are 2 versions - the base versionand the 4G version. Only the 4G version has the SIM card slots. The base version will NOT have any cellular capabilities at all (phone, data, etc). They advertised the case as having two SIM card slots without really making it clear that that was only for the 4G model. So I can understand how some people might not have realised this. I hope we will have some updates from the team at ESTI soon. Andrey were you on of the first bashers who backed around 69 USD in that case that was for non 4g and bashers who need 4g had to pay extra I've received the survey with reward selection where I can see that if I want to use 4G I should pay extra +$39. It is very strange, becuase in the project description I can see the detailed specification where it is stated that the Eye will be already equiped by 2 SIM slots which are compatible with 4G and there are no any notification that this is an extra option for Eye and I should pay extra $39 for it. Where is truth? In the project description or in the survey? I hope that the project description is correct, becuase I've backed the project and choosed my reward in accordance with this information. 1 week ago I've sent a message to Eye team about this situation, but nobody answered. If we ordered the non 4G version will it still have like "Phone" and "Text" apps installed? I have a situation with the survey. I am able de decide on one phone model, but would like for the new iPhones till I decide on the second one. The survey is not letting me do this. @Solomon L Johnson Apple Airpods act as regular bluetooth earbuds. I use them with my windows PC at work. So yes, you should be able to use them with the case. You just won't get that fancy display of the case and earbud's battery life. Do the Apple AirPods work with the case? hi there i order the 4g eye can i still use it if i have verizone @ESTI I messaged you guys this 5 days ago and I still didn't get a response. I'd like to fill out my survey soon. "I got my survey, and I purchased 2 4G Eye's. I want one for the 7 Plus and one for the next iPhone. The problem is, I'm afraid that if I select "wait for next iPhone" I might put both cases for the next iPhone. Any suggestions? Also, can we have an update with pictures of all the colors?" Guess we should let the developers settle down, am sure they are working hard on getting the final design ready and one prototype for us to get look and feel So last time you replied was the 19th and you posted an update the 27th but yet you haven't posted about if your in China or still ironing out things to get ready to go to China to make this dream a reality. I hope you are not going to go dark and not say anything as Fuzure has done. PLEASE give us a tidbit of how things are or about to be so we know your all still there. Is it possible to see a final polished product? Hi just wondering if you will show us a model or something of what the eye will look like on the new iphones before we have to make a choice? cheers I have not received my survey. Please send to me immediately. Thanks. I still never got my survey and my email is right what should I do ? Please send me a survey. I updated my email account on kickstarter. survey was NOT received ! I checked spam also .. nothing @Joseph cheung There is an option in the survery for that. Survey Select the color wrong ( Jet white -> Jet black plz ) @esti_inc. if I want the Eye on the next iPhone, how should I fill in the survey? @liam_kettle When you get your survey you can add extra items like the power bank. But you will have to pay the additional amount with a credit card if you do not include it in your Kickstarter pledge. The prices were the same as during the campaign and I saw options for the power bank, the wireless charging stand and the 64GB internal storage upgrade. FYI, I received my survey yesterday, but it ended up in my "Promotions" tab in Gmail. The survey email is sent from eye-smart-android-case-for-<email> im just wondering how i can upgrade my eye to include a power bank? Many Thanks Liam Finally received the survey, can't wait for the actual product! Any chance you will support CopperheadOS on the Eye? i got my survery yesterday thank you I want a 6 & a 7 case , but in the survey 6 & 7 are the same , but they are two different cases ? I'm about to complete the survey but am not keen on having to pay additional fee via my credit card why isn't there other options such as PayPal or Apple Pay as I paid the initial fee to Kickstarter? hi there, haven gotten my survey yet! may i know when will i roughly get it? Just to say, I'm still expecting an update to say you haven't been able to get the duel screen working for the camera, we don't actually care about this feature if it's waterproof! Finally got my survey so I am good to go. This case needs to hurry and get here as I am excited for this 2-in-1 case since Mophie and other companies wouldn't or couldn't do this. Hoping there will be no issues that will delay this case like the smartkase which is 3-4 months late. Come on August!!! It's nice to see people adding more things on which gives us a better chance at waterproofing and a successful launch I received the survey. I tried two different debit cards and both times they were declined. I called the bank to see if the attempted purchases were flagged as fraudulent, they weren't. Please help! I got my survey, and I purchased 2 4G Eye's. I want one for the 7 Plus and one for the next iPhone. The problem is, I'm afraid that if I select "wait for next iPhone" I might put both cases for the next iPhone. Any suggestions? Also, can we have an update with pictures of all the colors? I can't select Germany in the survey it isn't there. But I payed +22$ for shipping. How can I choose it. Maybe I missed it but I'd like to see pictures of the different colors before I finish the survey. Where might those be located? Just completed my survey. Very excited and cannot wait. The survey for you guys wondering, it's very informative and works great. Anything you pledge for will have the option to select. As well as add on's if there are any available left, you have the option to select those as well. They send out a confirmation email and also verify a few times to ensure everything is correct. Hopefully that ease a few peoples mind about how the surveys are. Thanks Esti! I think they posted it in indiegogo to gather more budget for waterproofing. Update #9 at bottom of the update you will see this.... Last thing: We'll do our best efforts to make the Eye smartcase waterproof. We know it's important to you guys! so there is no additional upgrade for water proofing ?????? so sad Yay finally got my survey I just saw that they posted this project on Indiegogo too. Trying to get more backer and delaying this project? That's not fair. Because they're delivering the project too on on September A little bit concerned that I haven't received the survey yet... Also if we want more add one are we allowed to do that on the survey or is it now "not allowed" I recently / few days ago change my email. Address for this account but would the survey go to my old email or my new one I mean, they have to send out 4,062 surveys. Imagine having to read those all at once. They would be flooded. They said it would take a few days for everyone to get the survey. They don't want to get swarmed with responses and have some get lost so they are doing it in batches. Just wait a little guys, you'll get it soon. I'm also still waiting for a survey. Dear eye team i have yet to receive my survey on this account but i did however receive the survey on another account which i used to also back you. So why am i not receiving the survey on this account/ I just got my survey! I'm so excited! Hello,just one question:can I listen to music stored on Eye through Iphone music reader? If the iPhone 8 does have the fingerprint sensor on the back are be able to switch back to the iPhone 7 case? Hello, you said the surveys were sent out 4 days ago. I still have not received mine as of yet. Same here- still waiting for my survey. When does surveys end? Standing by for my survey... Hey guys; I didn't receive the survey yet. Thank you Never mind I found the answer Will the eye case be able to connect to Canadian cellphone carriers like Rogers? If the fingerprint is on the back of the phone, I'd probably have to resell my Eye. Question, I only noticed the charging dock for the Eye, is it too late to add them? Hey guys, I still haven't received my survey :/ Hi how do I double check to make sure my pledge will get the 64gb upgrade ? Also is there an exact date when the surveys will be sent out? What email will the survey be sent from? just so i know what to search for in case it is sent to spam. Still haven't received my survey @Matthew Anderby The RAM is 3gb, plenty for a smartphone What will the RAM be ok the EYE? I don't think there could be a work around if Apple puts the fingerprint reader on the back of the phone. If that happens, I guess you'd just have to grin and bare it - it's not like the Eye case won't work. It will still work; you just won't be able to access the fingerprint sensor while you are using the case. Not a deal breaker for me personally. My iPhone 7 still has full functionality even if I don't use its fingerprint sensor. Will d case be same for 6s and 7? Or there would be changes in d dimensions of d case? Can d same case b used for both 6s and 7 rumor , mean may or may not be true until apple officiate it in their press conferences or website . or launch the product , anything can change Hello, I would like to know what @Trisheekeshan just asked. It is rumored that the new iPhone will have touch ID in the back. How do you guys plan to resolve that issue, because the only reason i backed the project was to have it for the new iPhone, but if i can't use the TouchID then no point of getting this. Please let us know. It is rumoured that the new iPhone will have a touch ID at the back of the phone. Will there still be an eye case available for the iPhone 8? The survey has been modified to enable you to choose the 64GB for each Eye case that you've ordered, as well as the wireless charger and extra memory case. No worries there... Relax everyone. They said in the update that it will take a few days for everyone to get the survey, they are doing it in batches Hi I still have not received my survey :(, and how do I know if its been confirmed that my eye 4g will be 64 gb? Still haven't received my survey... They are still working to get the survey correct. Many thanks! This survey only allows one of my Eye cases to get the 64GB upgrade. Plus, since I want to get one of my cases to be the upcoming model, I need to wait until November for both phones! That's not good... Are you guys going to make a case that opens on both sides so I can protect both screens? Please do. Is there any way you can make the Eye compatible with more cellular carriers? I have sprint and got the 4G model. Got my survey so it's only a matter of time. I am still waiting for the survey When will the survey end ? How much longer the survey? @Linh Hoang Yeah, you have to wait for the survey How do I pledge an addditional $83 dollars for on board 64gb and 10000mah battery? Do I wait until the survey gets emailed? Please advise. Thank you. @John Liu Thank you. Might have to downgrade to the normal eye then because i have a verizon data plan. @SwordmasterT I believe it's going to be the same Eye for both the 6 and 7 so it'll have a headset jack. And yes you are correct, the WiFi version will only connect to the internet if you are connected to WiFi, whereas the 4G one will be able to do both, connect via WiFi and thru your wireless carrier (if your carrier is AT&T and T-Mobile) And lastly, it will work with any iPhone, including the Verizon iPhone. However, you won't be able to get a data plan with Verizon on your 4G Eye. Hi Creator I could change to TouchWiz Samsung Interface? Would work well? (No lags) (Interesting to buy one spen and work with that) I also had another quest after reading more of the comments 1. So the real different between eye and the 4G is that if you have a data plan on a sim card, you can put it in 4G version and it will work but not on the normal one? Because my original thought was the 4G was so it could connect to the internet when there is no wifi and the normal could only connect when there was wifi. 2. I read a comment saying Verizon wasn't support. connecting to my question about, does it refer to a verizon sim card with a data plan or if the iPhone uses verizon? Sorry for being a little slow on this stuff. Hi! not sure if this was answered already but will the iPhone 7 verison also have a headphone jack or only a lightning connector? Hi I heard about rumors that the 10th anniversary iPhone would have a fingerprint reader at the back of the phone. It's start to worry me that the case will block the reader. Thanks in advance. How do I pledge an addditional $83 dollars for on board 64gb and 10000mah battery? Do I wait until the survey gets emailed? Please advise. Thank you. Please post a comment when we are supposed to have received the email I was wondering something. I am on the plan with my iPhone where I can freely upgrade after a year to the new model. Will you guys offer an option for us to wait until the new phone comes out to get a case for it or will we just have to choose a case for the phone we currently have. Please let me know and can't wait for this product! Read the updates and comments people all of your questions are already out there, do some research so the creator don't have to answer the same question 5 times. Clear he already told everyone he's getting the survey ready and will let all backer know when it's available, calm down its only been 5 days, and he's stated plenty of times the in that survey there will be a option to wait for the new model iPhone, DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE SPEND YOUR MONEY!! I'm so excited !!! Keep us in the loop! Ok guys we need to know what's going on, even though it's been 5 days that the case was successfully backed I haven't received my survey either. Please keep us informed even though it may be good or bad news. I hope when you start producing the cases you can post video/pics of the cases we will be getting along with the waterproof promise as well. If you will make cases for every iPhone when it comes out I hope you can give your backers a code to get that case at a reasonable price (25/30%) as paying $229 every year for most who get a phone every year is to much. For me I plan on using this case for at least 4 years until Apple doesn't support iOS updates anymore. When is the questionnaire? does it support fast wireless charging QC2.0/QC 3.0 @John Lui. Is that so? Its a shame I cant use google right now. But since you already know I would like to beg for your kind consideration to share your wisdom to me. Its not a troll Im serious. Any update on the survey for additional addon such as waterproofing or better gpu / cpu or better internet speed @Ron Manaog "Im not that smart, Actually Im quite dumb" Finally something we can agree on. Time for you to move on and troll someone else. And if you wanna know the difference, try using Google. I hear good things about them. @John Liu Your Welcome. Dont worry Im not that smart, Actually Im quite dumb as you mention I didnt even know the difference between suggestion and a request. If you would be so kind to share your knowledge to me and tell me the difference that would be really great I would really appreciate it!. Thankyou very much!. The next iPhone will be supported a month after its launch. An option will be given to Eye backers to wait until the next iPhone release. Can someone plz comment if there will be an iPhone 8 update for us backers as delivery date is close to launch of new iPhone. Thank you so how will we specify the phone size that each of us want? @Ron Manaog Once again, I was asking about future projects. NOT this one. So don't worry about any delays for THIS project. Wish you would read throughly before commenting. And thank you for your Marketing 101 & cellular expertise. Sorry I'm not as smart as you. Being as smart as you are, you should be able to distinguish the difference between a suggestion and a request. I made a suggestion to the creator to include coverage for Verizon for future projects. I clearly stated that too. Don't know where you got the idea that a suggestion for a future product will delay this one. @ John Liu You need to do research for marketing. Make a headcount. 1171 comments even if all of them ask for your request its not good enough. A handful isnt even worth. Not all verizon and sprint users will use Eye. And using common sense, it requires a "different" team to research and create that technology, the one that you are currrently pledged. Meaning its not that easy. Theres a high possibility that it may delay the production if theres not enough budget. I told you enough. And I will tell you this. Based on common sense, theres a high possibility that it may not be done, atleast for now. Also based on my experience and expertise, what your trying to do is make the team start from scratch. It might be a best choice to create a different product, an eye with CDMA technology later after this campaign. @Ron Manaog "youre making the team adjust for you and since we will also receive the same item we adjust as well, having an item with unusable feature for us" The creator already said they weren't making this campaign compatible with Verizon and I have accepted that. I was asking about any future prototypes or their next project. "If you really want to make your request possible make a headcount of person who will have sprint or verizon and will also buy eye. Prove that the "untapped market" is real or not." Without even scrolling thru the comments, I can tell you that I've read a handful of request for this, not to mention countless others on other campaign. "Untapped market" means that there's an opportunity for a product there. Consider that there are hundreds of similar dual devices out there means there's a demand for the product. **IF** that product isn't available for a large market, don't you think there might be an opportunity there? Sometimes you don't need to do research for common sense. I couldn't and can't afford the extra's until I get paychecks in from the job I just started again. Hopefully when you send out the backerkit it has all the addon options like pretty much all kickstarters I back now. Can someone please comment on the plan to update for iPhone 8 which is due in September. They started taking money already .. can't wait till aug when would the funds be deducted ? Btw. @ESTI team. I saw all your efforts. Thankyou for doing everything for us. Your doing a great effort to reach the lacking cost in this campaign for waterproofing. I really like this team. @John Liu Eye is made that way since majority of the world works that way. If you want change youre making the team adjust for you and since we will also receive the same item we adjust as well, having an item with unusable feature for us. Anyway its not a big deal xD. If you really want to make your request possible make a headcount of person who will have sprint or verizon and will also buy eye. Prove that the "untapped market" is real or not. If the team reconsidered, and you guaranteed true profit then the number of backers increased due to this. Then we may reach to a point where we will have waterproofing. Its a win-win for both of us so I will support you on that. But if your claim isnt true then addt'l cost to your request will have negative impact to ALL of us backers in the whole world. It may delay due to lack of budget and worst will FAIL. So make sure your claim is true first and all of us will be happy but if not, all of us have no one to blaim but you. There are a lot to consider. Dont make selfish request. Anyway it will depend on the team if they will consider. ALSO. Im not inclined to Wireless technology but as I know. Mt6757 does not support CDMA so you should consider search for replacement SOC. Then CDMA unlike GSM requires the carriers permission to switch phones, are you sure your carrier will allow EYE?. The sim card of verizon and sprint are generally used for LTE as i know. But that is only what I know, im not sure if theres development or "upgrades" to the current technology. There are so much to consider... @Ron Manaog Maybe you're reading it wrong... Who said anything about making the world adjust? The creators are in the Middle East, they may or may not know that Verizon is the largest carrier in the US and that it runs on CDMA. I am pointing out that there's an untapped market there because there isn't any dual sim devices available for their network. I would like to add extra money for upgrades for battery bank up to 10000 and I'm just wondering if is still ok for me to add extra money in to the projects since the backing is closed already, I really want my case to have extra battery there Maybe you should wait for Verizon to "Retire" CDMA as well. You should not make the whole world adjust to you. In technology It is good to have backward compatibility but one should always aim for innovation. How bright is the screen? How do i manage my pledge to add monies for the extra on-board storage? How does EYE accept voice input without a built in microphone? How would you use the Google assistant? Please add Google assistant company compatibility and maybe even daydream compatibility. @ Andrew Berg, I am aware that only Verizon and Sprint uses CDMA and the rest of the world uses GSM. Even our neighboring country, Mexico retired CDMA a year ago. My point is that every single dual sim device available in the market is using GSM. ***IF*** Eye made it compatible with Verizon, then they'll have an untapped market. I've been looking forever for a dual sim case that supports CDMA, none is available at the moment and KS has 1 campaign that offers a dual sim supporting CDMA. However, the backers (myself included) of that campaign isn't confident in that product. John Luis you are correct that Verizon is biggest provider in the USA , but CDMA is only used used on Verizon and sprint. GSM is used worldwide if you add up sprint and Verizon and then att and T-Mobile you see that gsm beats Verizon choice CDMA. Then add in the rest of the world. As a company learns what is my IPHONE model? Where this is fixed? And why is the money from the card not be charged? Any chance of making both sim standby 3G/4G as a lot of countries are starting to wind down 2G alr. Which makes 1 sim redundant @creators If you guys are considering testing a Verizon prototype let me know, I'll be willing to test it and buy it! You should seriously consider making it work with Verizon, they have the largest subscribers in the US. You're missing out on a huge market! How can I add or subtract amount from my pledge ? Love to have waterproofing How do I know I'm confirmed for the 64GB upgrade? Hi, I backed this project for the sole purpose that it can bring "wireless charging" to iPhone, it's a wishlist since so many version of iphones. Now I wonder if as a creator of this product, would you know which wireless charging base product that I can buy to put in my home. I don't want to end up buying wireless charging base that can't be used to charge the eye case. Hope to hear from you soon and thank you in advance! Cheers... When do we get to choose the iPhone we have? I have the regular iPhone 7 Congrats and thanks for trying to include the waterproofing ability in the case. Greatly appreciated! I wonder if they have any intent of upgrading the GPU prior to release? The stock GPU is very slow so any game that requires graphic horsepower won't run well on the device. I'd pay extra for a mid-range (or higher) GPU instead of the super low end one that it currently has. Hi I wanted to know if I could play sounds from my iPhone without headphones when the case is on I really hope they find the opportunity to squeeze waterproofing into the case. There would be no other case I'd ever need. Congrats on getting funded! So glad to be a part of this exciting project! Congrats team and as suggested please reduce the value during the transit on package so we don't get into custom mess � Hello, Since Iphone 8 is on its way, will you be making any updates to it? Hi guys. Great job. I look forward to get this great tool because I want to read my diabetes sensor what Apple will not let me do with its NFC chip � I myself also looking forward to this case in August/September. Hopefully you have all the licenses that you need to make this dream a reality and not have delays as smartkase has already. I also hope that you'll make iPhone cases when new ones come out as I would definitely get one and I hope backers who get the cases as new iPhones come out we will get a respectable discount since we were able to make your dream a fruition. Also hope new colors will be introduced down the road too like blue, red other than black or white to make the persons case unique. Congratulation Creators! mind would give a suggestion regarding the price to input when on declare the value? so we can lower the tax to pay. iknow thats its not alot, but some country are limit about $100 for free tax... thankyou and goodluck! congratz kickstarter should release the funds in 2 weeks. I cant wait to reciece my case I can't wait for this to come in the mail. I'm sooooo excited for this project. Great idea and looking forward to seeing it come to life Now that project is successfully funded when will kickstarter take money from debit card Hey guys. I was the third to support the case st the beginning Of the campaign. I remember reading something before the campaign started on the hotsite that the First five People that supported the campaign would get the for free. Is it true? Thanks. Hi I wanted to know if I could play sounds from my iPhone without headphones when the case is on Looking forward to hearing as this develops! This will be great for my up come trip in sept.. :D thank you for your hard work and up coming work. Now what? Will definitely pay extra if waterproofing becomes an option Only 26 minutes left. Looks like no waterproofing for us.:( No need for me to upgrade. I'll stay in basic 16GB storage. I am willing to pay extra for waterproofing if it is not unlocked. The project will end in a few hours so I have a last question: will it actually have a lightningport? Think the waterproofing is essential to match the iPhones standard please look into it as an addon if we don't reach the unlocking amount. if the option for waterproofing is unlocked do we need to pay or FOC ? if we do not hit 1 million , can we opt to pay a nominal amount for the casing to be waterproof . do explore this option if available as well as other upgrades such as better GUP and internet connection (wifi) pardon me repeating the same question as it is not answered @J Allen Hull Straight Talk should work if it catches an AT&T or T-Mobile tower. Looks like they use AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon. <url>" tempered glass screen protector that is thick enough so that when it is placed on the EYE's screen, it feels and appears like there is no lip, but it is still protected? why is it eye smart case dont support verizon Please make it water proof to match the iPhone 7 I am backer 1184 and originally backed for Super early birds then changed to Early birds - 4G. I don't need 4G but can't go back to Super early birds even though it was my original pledge level. Can you help? Now that campaign is coming to end am very excited all the best guys and thank you for such a wonderful product 1.Is it possible for you to provide videos of the functionality of the newest model including powerbank and footage of actual use including how the interenet browsing,text,and phone calls using the non 4g so we can see how it interacts with the iphone? 2.With the non 4g version if the main device ran off sprint would it still be able to uss its data for connectivity or is that feature only supported through Tmobile and AT&T? What happens after this is done will you have a website where you will sell these cases? Will there be a "lip" on the iphone side as to protect the iphone when placing the phone facedown on a surface? I was watching your Eye fully working unpainted prototype vid and it seems like there was no "lip" on the iphone side for protection. First of all good luck on your awesome vision and product. Awesome because your aim is to incorporate ultimate android functionality next to IOS. I made a pledge and have iPhone 7 plus. Eagerly waiting for this product. I went extra mile for 64gb version and realised, Will this have a bigger capacity battery? Beacuse we are not going to get to 1mil you could maybe in the end survey get an option for the water profing for an extra pledge? On the esti.me website, it says that the cases's charging port is "lightning for iOS and USB C for android". But aren't you saying that you're using a lightning port for the case? Please use USB C because it's the future and everyone wishes that apple would adopt USB C on the iPhone edition but they are still using lightning. It will be a major selling point if the EYE uses USB C!!! Will the 4G version support SIM cards from Straight Talk wireless? Featured on phone arena <url>"Read more about campaign". Specifications page is written "Language 〜" But Japanese is not included. Why? I'd also be interested in what your response to the criticisms about the GPU and wifi cards is I believe that the ip67 rating for the case being offered now would be the most likely way to reach $1M in the remaining 50 hours. People are likely holding off pledging until they can be certain this feature will be included, as it really is a phenomenally important one, especially given that the iPhone 7 and later devices will have this (or better) rating themselves. What's the point in a case for a waterproof phone that you can't get wet? Seems like a far more important feature than expanded on board memory or battery pack options. IMO While I am very excited about this case, I am wondering if there is going to a way to clip it to a belt, protect the screens, etc. and all of the jobs a standard case can accomplish? Will there be any of those features? Thanks! I have Verizon and orderd the 4G version. What US carriers does it support? I'll need to change back to non 4G also is there microsd slot? Dear friend, Plan to upgrade phone from 6sPlus to 7Plus. Please advise if 7Plus eye case will fit to 6sPlus as well? Just in case I not going to 7Plus. I still manage to fit my existing iPhone. Please so kind to advise. Thank you in advance. Best Regards, J.C I pledge already for the 4g one ! How to choose 6plus jet black ? Do you have a expected shipping date? on August 28th I am flying to israel for the year and need to decide wether to have my case sjipped to the us or to israel. We are never going to get 350k$ in 72h so It would be more realistic to have water proving at 700k$? This looks like a great product. Good luck with your $1 mil stretch goal! Please elaborate on your comment: "Including the Verizon and Sprint means to replace the processor to much more expensive one. We might consider it in the future." When you say "in the future" are you referring to a stretch goal or the iPhone 8 version or your next project? I will be more than willing to pay extra for the processor for a Verizon version! Can you guys add the waterproofing for an extra charge?? This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. Hey, i love this product, I have also bought one of the mesuits for iphone 6s from www.gizmaze.com and it works wonderfully as well, I hope that your product can also live up to the claims similar to mesuit..... Nah when you had CD cheaper options and were in inbox therapy you went up over 150k in a day more expensive on everything applr pro 30k Nah Extend the Super early birds - 4G for $129!!! :D Hi I wanna buy. Four just wifi eye cases since two eye 180 x2 360 +12 =372 is that okay Great idea hoping we will get our hand on eye soon. questions: from what device 3.5 mm jack serve. is it selectable? can I storage music in eye and play it on iPhone or the other way around? can eye provide internet connection to iPhone? (not via hotspot) also can I purchase another eye or accessory after survey come out? Even if all pledges are bought. It will never reach 1M. How do I get the accessories? I am noticing quite a few let downs regarding service providers in the states. For those of us in places like Japan that use Au, Docomo or SoftBank; will their Sims work in the case? Hello Creator n Everyone, 4 days To Go! May The Force Be with you ���� ���� 1000th Comment :D. I just wanna say thankyou for your efforts. That's a great idea...extend for a few more days.. Also if you can just add 20 or 30 dollars to everyone's amount.. it will be raised enough.. so sad that it would not have waterproofing integrated due to the response below 1million , would the days to go be extended to another 15 day to 1 month so we can hit 1 million , so we can have a win win situation for all the backers ? Is that 4G working for germany? Unless you add more early birds for cheaper you will never reach 1 mill just not enough demand at current prices, to get waterproof either add cheaper options or lower goal How does the case actually interface with the iPhone (specifically the calls)? Is it through the lightning port or BLE? I ask because there are similar products (without the android part) that achieve interfacing with the second SIM through BLE, but I prefer a direct hardware interface if possible. Hi I ordered x4 (4G cellular) units .. just wanted to upgrade one of the units to 64G and add one wireless charger .. my pledge now is $528 .. is this OK? Thanks I was really hoping that this was this was going to Support Verizon. My Personal phone is an iPhone 7Plus on ATT and my Work phone is also an iphone on Verizon. Why were the Verizon / Sprint Bands not included and what would it take if possible to include those Bands? Are you looking to release a "Verizon" Version in the near future? I'd like to see anandtech review this case! In a preproduction prototype closer to release form of course! Dear Joseph and developers team, This project is very exciting and I look forward to seeing final product. I've backed few very promising projects last year and they've been postponed several times already. Therfore, I'd like to ask few questions regarding estimated production and some technical questions. I tried to read all the comments but there are simply too many of these, so sorry if you have to answer the question again: 1) it is mentioned that super early birds will receive their devices already in September. Do you still consider this schedule realistic, since you still don't have the mfi certificate, pre production prototype and you still don't have a stable software. 2) as I understood the case is using iphone's speaker, microphone, receiver and camera, right? Are there any other things being shared by the case and iPhone? 3) does the case have a Bluetooth module? Will it interfere with iphone's Bluetooth module and two WiFi modules? 4) does it have a GPS module or can it use iphone's GPS module? 5) not sure what the answers for Q2 and Q3 would be and I'm not sure if that ever be necessary, but will it be possible simultaneously talking on the iPhone and Android? If not with build in mic, speaker and receiver then at least with Bluetooth headset? Many thanks in advance and best luck for the rest of the campaign! Cheers, Stan @creators, some questions: 1. When using dual sim, can both be used simultaneously for making calls and for mobile data? 2. How do you switch between the two to make / receive calls and surf the Internet? Thanks! Hello, You had said that in the U.S. the cellular connection only supports at&t and t-mobile , is that only for the major carriers? Could I get a pay as you go card or one time use card from Walmart and use it in the eye case? How can i add $59 ? About the add on battery, is it for the iPhone or eye or both can use the add on battery? Just seen the vid on EverythingApplePro and apart from the glue around the screen edges it looks good. I am still concerned about where the SIM/storage slots are going to be and how robust they will be. If necessary, the case could be made a little longer to accommodate. Every effort should be made to be Apple certified so that a lightning connector can be used at the bottom Hi, I have just pledged and would like to ask a couple of questions. 1) For the finishing product, will it be in those glossy kind of silicon cover? Those kind of shiny cover will tend to leave unsightly fingerprint marks. 2) For 4G cellular option, which side (iPhone or Android) do we answer and make calls from? 3) Will there be the usual vibration when we receive calls/messages from the Android side? Thanks and keep up the excellent work! I want pledge X10 units of Eye 4G. Please kindly contact me with regard to the shipping charges. I am in China. Thanks:) Great video. I also agree about the graphics processor needing a boost. It's extremely important to have a modern product at launch. Also, I noted your comment about the wifi speed issue being a software issue. I hope this is the case. Please provide your backers with a video of the updated speeds once this is fixed. Thanks and good work! Any chance of getting you to make the case in safety orange? I can see a lot of folks in the public safety sectors using an outward facing screen while communicating. Do i need to change my pledge to the stretched goal $149 to get 64gb storage? I have already chosen the $149 since beginning? Please use USB-C instead of lightning, everyone loves USB-C and include the cable in the box. I can imagine Apple not allowing you to get the permit to use lightning, and then everyone's cases will be useless. USB-C is universal, the future and you could implement fast charging. When will a production intent sample be available for viewing? Where is the port for the USB OTG on Android? Would like to plug in a high quality USB DAC. So just finished the new video review seems everything looks great so far except the graphic processor. Why go all out on the phones main processor but leave behind the power on the graphics processor? Will this thing work with Sprint service in Los Angeles? @creator, hopefully the WiFi chip can be tweaked or a different one as speeds were low as EverythingApple had said in their video about your case as we the backers will be using via wifi at home and out and about Hi, I just to to increase my pledge amount for those additional items featured correct? For example 149+20+59 For the wireless charger and 64gb option? A quick question, the dual-sim, will it be 4g/3g at least, across Asia a lot of countries have either retired or are retiring soon their 2G networks. So a dual-sim with a 4g/2g capability will pretty much be as good as a single sim phone, markets include Japan/ South Korea/ Singapore/ Thailand and I believe Australia too soon. hey I just wanna say hi to everyone � Will i have the ability to choose the case for the upcoming iphone 8 model? Do you make a holster or belt clip for the eye? @Adam W: I assume it may not have cellular connectivity at all without the 4G option, but rather just connect to the iPhone by Wifi or cable. Is there a way to automatically throttle the CPU in Android if it overheats? Most Android phones run really hot and I am worried it would damage my iPhone or the longevity of its expensive built-in battery. If for whatever reason you fail to get MFi certification from Apple for the HDMI-over-lightning port Selfie feature, will I be able to get a refund? Will there be USB OTG on Android? Powerbank can work without eye case? I've ordered just a standard eye but have noticed that there are more expensive pledge options with 4G? whats the difference? Am I limited to 3G with the standard eye or can I add 4G as an addon? Definitely think you should ship it already rooted as you can brick devices if the person rooting the devices does something wrong in the process Can the SIM slots be used as an always on wifi hotspot using a 4G or LTE network? This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. Will the non 4G model have the sim slots for the extra 258gb of storage? I have a question will the case fit both the iPhone 6 and 7, or will they be different cases altogether? I have both models, the reason being that one of the models is for work and I have an extra iPhone 6 laying around from work, which they gave me after a certain amount of time. Now, when I switch to the iPhone 7 I used my old case from the 6 on to the new phone and it works great. It did block a bit of the bottom camera, but it did not deter me from taking pictures. Since I have the regular version for both (not the plus), will the case fit both? Kindly make the waterproofing at 600k stretch goal..for free or with some additional amount... as it's very necessary to have this... kindly consider.... "What will the finished product look like and be made of? The prototype material looks like those cheap plastic/silicone cases you can get for $5 which is a turn off....." "The materials will be much more solid, beautiful, strong and durable. It won't be made of from this prototype materials." Mind elaborating as to what those materials are and how it will look??? When I have the additionlal battery di I place it instead the iphone? How do I add the additional funds to get the bigger storage and battery? Also I've pledged but couldn't find an option to opt for the iPhone 7 plus? Or do we choose these at the end? Is iPhone 6s and iPhone 7 (iPhone 7s) can share one case? I am not sure about the external changes of those two phones so I would like to know. Thank you. Is there a raised edge to protect the iPhone screen 64gb upgrade + 10,000 battery upgrage Charging while extensive use of Iphone can damage its hardware, is there a function to turn off charging?. For the update of Android OS will it be OTA? In the Youtube video eye is in cyanogenmod, are you going to use CM or are you developing your own software?,. In the campaign you mention about many possibilities of eye especially when rooted. Is it possible for eye to be pre-rooted before shipped to us?. I suggested that if possible the eye could be engraved with the backer number and initials. Any word on the engraving? Or is that out? Sorry ESTI but "following all Apple MFi (Made For iPhone) certification guidelines and there is no reason for us not to get certified" sounds very familiar to me. Have you seen the history of the iExpander story? Hi.. may I know how are we going to collect it..? And iphone 7 plus is it able to use..? I am a Kickstarter tragic who has been disappointed by a rather similar project in the past - that being the iExpander from 2012. My memory is that the project fell apart because getting apple to allow the it past product submission proved to be a massive hurdle. It is timely that today I got update #95 from iExpander which in summary says 'sorry'. How can you convince me that this is not going to be another iExpander saga - when it is going to cost me rather more than the $95 that that loss cost me? Nick i have a question i pledge 149 then i add 59 total 218 .00 whats my reword How many BLE connections can my iphone make? I understand my apple watch uses one BLE connection. Will this case work as a slave device at the same time? How fast is the communication between iphone and eye? I love your project and have pleged for an Eye 4G. But I have a question. Could you please clarify if you choose to upgrade the storage from 16GB to 64GB, do you still use the 2nd SIM/SD card slot? can i add two wireless chargers to the two pack 4G's? I also plan on waiting until the next iPhone comes out. Will I be able to expand to 64gb later in the year but before the new iPhones announced? Will there be any external speakers in the case? Seems the ones in the phone would get covered up. That's my only concern. Otherwise this is so cool. May I suggest you migrate the page to Indigogo once the deadline is hit, in order to allow for stretch goals to be reached past April 15th? Hello, I updated my pledge to include the extra $59 for the 64gb of storage, but I didn't get any area to add text to specify this. How do I know that it will be recognized? Thanks! If the regular case is 0.52" thick. How much's thick gonna be with additional battery? Thank you Can there be a $1 pledge added like most Kickstarter pages have so we can get credit for backing this as well as receive updates? I don't have an iPhone but i LOVE this idea and would love to support it! Charging while extensive use of Iphone can damage its hardware, is there a function to turn off charging?. For the update of Android OS will it be OTA? In the Youtube video eye is in cyanogenmod, are you going to use CM or are you developing your own software?,. Is it possible for eye to be pre-rooted before shipped to us?. For those who don't understand the benefits having 64GB onboard storage (or more). My opinion is : - more installable apps, - fewer latencies using the apps, - transfer with the SD card to another device (if you don't use the SD card for app, but only for data) - Not an obligation to bake, but an oportunity Can we get shipping info?. Like shipping from what country, etc. @Joe I'm baker like you, not from the eye Team. I saw many time in the comments, the answer... and it is........... YES ! :o) Couple of quick questions from a new backer here (if they're already answered somewhere and I missed it then I apologise) - How long will the battery last on it's own with the always on function of the display enabled? - If the battery of the case is empty, can it use the battery of the iphone to continue to work? - Does the android OS support bluetooth so that for example I can use bluetooth accessories with android apps? - Does the interconnectivity between the 2 devices (like using the android display as an external screen for the camera selfies) require some sort of api interface with the iPhone that Apple can disable at some point, or is this all handled through the direct lightning connection and cam it never be disabled by Apple? - Since the case supports Micro SD expansion, what are the benefits of having 64GB of onboard storage v.s. buying a 64GB extra micro SD card to expand the storage? - Can the Android OS be updated in the future and if so how? - How drop proof is the android screen? I know it has a raised besel protecting it from scratches, but how much impact protection does it have? Thanks in advance for your time ! Dear Eye inventor, I just had a quick question that the 4G supports for Malaysia's Service Operator? Just double check before make decision. Cheers~! BR, J.C. I asked this awhile back never got a reply does the eye case work without being connected to the iPhone just curious i just read mike wiseman comment below, and just know that 4g option are limited. would u mine to add extra buck for 4g option when reach 600.000? i would say this is more important than storage on board and batttery. please check consider that. I want eye to be no limit. and availabe use 4g in US, Asia and Europe. thanks. I did the math and you need to add more early birds to get to a million, and currently price wise you won't get TR hat much more adding cheaper such as more 130$ 4g will help you get there Question on the 4G in the US, as you aren't supporting US LTE networks (I just found out about this via previous comments) will it still connect at 3G in the US? Failing that, can it "piggy back" off the iPhone 4GLTE connection? Looks like ubuntu is dropping the ubuntu phone. Should it be removed from this project? <url>"A battery bank in the shape of the iPhone and little bit thicker will be mounted inside the case." Thickness after the power bank add on pls? Hi, I am trying to find the specs for the Android part. What kind of screen, screen resolution, processor and amount of RAM is it going to have? Love the idea! Thanks! @ESTI I'm still hopeful that you would support US LTE bands. Thats the only thing thats restricting me to upgrade my pledge to 4G version. I'm sure there are other US backers who are holding up on upgrading to 4G version, because of this limitation. Please make it clear to US backers (which now constitute 43% of your total backers) whether you would be supporting US LTE bands or not. Can you make phone calls with the 4G version? Thanks! So, how do I know if it's for the iPhone 7plus? Also I didn't really understand: does it already contain a battery? Or do I have to pledge an additional amount of money? Thanks! I've backed an eye 4G however I'm not sure weather it is for IPhone 7 or IPhone 7 Plus that I backed. How would I know? I backed the "X2 Units" pledge, how do specify add-ons such as the Power Bank add-on and the upgrade to 64GB for a specific Eye Unit? Any idea when we will receive our case? Because i dont see any plans when you are going to begin production and shipping .. I kinda can't even manage to play some music on the Galaxy S2 because whenever I try to put it down into my pocket it end up flipping around the interface, turn off the music and enter album view or such .. :D Touch screen feel very annoying then. Will you deactivate the touch-screen on the screen turned down in all cases with some software? Otherwise it will give a very crappy user-experience because one will click everywhere without intending so. Something you may not have though about what do I know. Will you have order tracking info for us during shipping?. Also can we get shipping information in the FAQ. Hello creators, is there any chance you would consider making the port on the case a micro-USB instead of a lightning port? I think it would be more advantageous if iPhone users could benefit from the ubiquitous streamlined connectors that the androids have; then it would essentially have both ports (if I understand the setup correctly). Obviously this is just my opinion and should not be considered the standard view among backers, but if you would consider it then perhaps it is worth a poll? What will the finished product look like and be made of? The prototype material looks like those cheap plastic/silicone cases you can get for $5 which is a turn off..... @Prabu When the campaign finishes, if it is fully funded, Kickstarter will charge your card. Hi I m new to kickstarter I have given my debit card details to pledge, how kick starter will process my payment After reading some of the previous questions, am I correct in understanding that the port on the bottom of the eye will be a lighting port and not micro usb? If it is in fact lighting, will it be possible to use lighting headphones with the iPhone while it is in the eye case? If I want to add-on the battery, it is just add into the pledge? The FAQs say, "The iPhone's cellular data connection will supply the internet connection to Eye but not via hotspot..." Does this mean if we get an Eye without 4G, it will still have internet connectivity without wifi? How to add 64G to my order? OOPS My bad... please feel free to ignore my second question. I got my answer to that question after looking at the campaign page again. Also, just to clarify, the standalone case with power bank cannot be used as a phone correct. It will still need to connect to an iPhone for wifi connection, etc etc?? Heya guys, quick question. If we wait for the next iPhone and then decide we don't want that option, will we be able to revert our choice back to one of the current available options. I ask this because of the rumour mill churning out info that the next iPhone will itself support wireless charging, etc, so I may then not decide to get a case for it but for my current gen iPhone instead. I'd like to buy 50 units of the 4G case for the 6s. How can I do that? Also, can someone get in touch with me for a POC at an enterprise level? Hi, creator... I am still confuse with the powerbank functionality. Is the addon powerbank will be function like as iphone's battery case? Means when iPhone low battery, this eye can use as powerbank to charge the iphone. Hi I want to pledge 3 EYE-4G, how can I do? I have pledged one EYE-4G already. This is rip off. Stretch Goal is for free present as thanks-to-help-us and not pull even more money from the to the customer / support pockets. By the higher number of units than expected you make already more profit. You have significantly less cost per piece. That is not enough for you, isn't it? I hereby withdraw my backer-contribution completely. If I add battery bank(24$), the eye cannot connect with iphone for make a call with eye. If it can do that how can do that? My current pledge is enough to cover the EYE, Charger, Extra memory and the Powerbank but there is no option for me to add the accessories(Charger, Extra memory and the Powerbank). By that I mean is the $24 powerbank able to be used and attached at the same time with the eye case or is it separate only? Could the powerbank be used with the Eye case? Sorry I didn't mean 120k I meant 38.3k and it's only 212 additional people with 520k currently even if all those people pay 20$ for power bank 20 for charging pad and 59 for 64gb that's only 21.2k more bringing your grand total too 579.5k $ and to a grand total of just over 3600 backwrs meaning each backer would need to give another 100$ to get to a million and no way is that going to happen. Sorry to pop a whole in your bubble, unless you add more early birds you will not get to a million I just did the math for if all the remaining early birds sell out and if they all sell out that would only be another 120k Ik this may sound dumb but before you ship will we be allowed to add more things on like say later to add like maybe more eyes or powerbanks etc. oK Got It, so on my pledge, i just edit my amount pledge with extra $$$, So the Eye 149 + powerbank $24 + Storage $59 the amount i edit is $232, is it? the wireless charger will be available what color and how many Ampere? is it fast enough and safety? For the case finish color like jet black and matt black, could u provide more image? like front, left, right & bottom elevation. on video Unbox Therapy, eye case is jet black or matt black? the one u send the prototype for review. thank you eye. I cant wait to see the real things Hi there. Would like to enquire. If i purchase the X2 Eye lasertag option and i would like to add on the powerbank, will both Eye be included with powerbanks? I think a lot of people are confused and haven't read the fine print. The power bank add-on will be in the shape of an iPhone (basically) and will go into the iPhone slot. So, you will not be able to have the iPhone and extra power bank at the same time. Is this correct? *edited* When we reach the million goal, if the the next iPhone is going to be IP68, will Eye be able to match the new iPhone or it'll just be IP67? When we reach the million goal, if the the next iPhone is going to be IP68, will it be able to match it or it'll just be IP67? IS THERE AN OPTION TO TURN OFF THE SCREEN WHEN OTHER SCREEN IS IN USED @thomas Uebel I understand how kick starter works, but I also understand how supply and demand control pricing, and that the 129$ 4g one sold the fastedt when I first donated I ordered the 95$ regular eye and there was over 700 of them and their was over 850 eye 4gs at 129$, later that day their were still over 500 regular eyes at 95$ but no 4g eyes at 129$ , but the eye 4gs at 149$ never sold as fast because people aren't willing to pay that much, it's all about finding the right price at which people are willing to pay The people who request more super early birds really have no clue how kcickstarter works... Esti claims to be an Israel company yet it is more expensive to ship too Israel than the United States? Also if you wan to hit a million, you will have to add more 4g eyes at 129$, if you look in the first 4 days this kickstarted got to 464K and then it ran out of the 129$ 4g eyes and then it took another two and a half weeks to get another 36k and hit the stretch of 500,000. I understand you're only committing to ship Eye to your backers from August but what I'm saying is when will it be on retail sale? Or are you only producing enough to give to your backers? Basically only backers will be able to purchase Eye and not the retail public? If I upgrade my pledge to get 2 units and I want both to have 64gb and 10,000mAh, do I have to pay $166 ($83 per unit)? After the kickstarter ends, when do you expect to start mass producing them? Then when do you plan to start shipping them? hi do you have some images of how thick the case will be with the power bank option ? When will Eye be shipping to the general public? If early birds are getting it around August, will it be on general sale before Christmas? do you have any pictures of power bank attached on iphone? sorry Guys, i cant found any add on menu? could u guys assist me step by step? im using kickstarter apps on ios. thanks 10 days to go and we have yet to hear of the date for the live demo. Anything set up yet? If y'all don't achieve the $1 million goal for water proofing, will there be anyway to get that as an add on for people who backed the project? I had already added for wireless charger.. waiting for best deal for power bank and 64gb I mean I want all three (wireless charger + 64gb + power bank) @ESTI Inc :- Any discount for backers who are willing to pledge for 64gb + powerbank? i also added the 83 for power bank and upgrade Does the version of Android on the Eye allow root access? Hi Esti, for the nee pledge, both the powerbank AND the 64GB expansion total $83! My new pledge is now $212 is that correct? Can you please check and clarify for me. Congrats on the 500k! If I add $24 for the powerbank, $59 for the 64 gb and $20 for the charging stand which will add up to $103. I add that amount to my pledge and I get all 3 things, correct? Hi, another question, what if we use the option to wait for the new iPhone, but then the new iPhone gets released but decides not to get one, will we able to rechoose any of the existing cases, say iPhone 7plus? Hi Esti, i want to add both the powerbank AND the 64GB expansion, do i need to add both the $24 and $59 total $83? Please clarify this for me. Hi ESTI, I pledged $129 for an Eye 4G initially, then when I heard about the 64GB upgrade possibility, pledged extra for that and the wireless charger - but before the $500K goal was reached. I saw that in reply to another backer, you told them to wait for the $500K to be reached before adding the $59. Does this mean that because I showed confidence in you and pledged extra support early, I will miss out on the 64GB upgrade and wireless charger unless I increase my pledge further? If true, that would leave a nasty taste in the mouth. Hi @ESTI! So i just add 83$ to my current pledge, i will get my EYE with both power bank and 64GB? Also, if we want to add both the powerbank AND the 64GB expansion, we need to add both the $24 and $59, correct? Just want clarify because I want BOTH! Also, if we want to add both the powerbank AND the 64GB expansion, we need to add both the $24 and $59, correct? Just want clarify because I want BOTH! I added $ 24.Do you add a power bank to my covenant? Hi good day :D. First of all I would like to thank you for the update of 500k stretch goal. I am extremely happy about this update, now I can add $24 to my pledge for the powerbank. For my question, I was wondering, If for example I ordered case for Iphone 7+ which is 5.5inch. Then I tried to connect the eye to an iphone 6 which is a smaller device with 4.7inch. This will result to excess space and misaligned camera and etc (appearance problem). Will the eye still work functionally?. Hi @ESTI! I'm so excited that we've reached the $500K and we can expand in internal memory to 64GB! So just to be sure, if I want to expand to 64GB I need to add $59 to my current pledge? Will us Early Birds be fully refunded if something should happen to prevent the case being made? Hey! Is the product MFi approved or your intention is to start the procedure after the campaign? hey! am an iphone 7 user, not iphone 7+. i would be given an option to choose after the campaign is completed right? :) thanks alot ! I really hope that this campaign can get to a million as waterproofing is equally important. If you are in a wet condition, you will still have to protect the case... Nothing is Free! You have to pay for any upgrades I'm with Sreekanth on this one , I wish the us lte bands would be supported. Never mind found it So we finally met the 500 K goal and 11 days still left so that means we get the 64GB or we have to pay $59? Interesting question: This awesome product enhances the iPhone's functionality, which is obviously the biggest selling point for all of us. However, does the Eye have the ability to work independently from an iPhone, meaning can we just use the Eye even when it is not attached to an iPhone as its own standalone device? Curious if the product will be capable of functioning on its own! I almost Forgot! when i answer phone from Eye, ist im using iphone ear speaker? how Eye connected to my iphone? ist using bluetooth? if using bluetooth then i cant connect my other device like bluetooth headphone? tq When you say that when the eye is connected to the PC/Mac it recognizes it as data, does that mean we will be able to put music and other materials from the computer on the case or not? For eye with 4g capability, does it mean that I am able to have 2 mobile phone numbers working at the same ? Or is it restricted to only one selected number at any given time ? Not sure if you answered this does the case work without the phone I want this case so that I may use Android Auto in my car. Because having Google Maps on my dash instead of Apple Maps is worth it. Question is, if this is plugged in via USB, is the iPhone automatically going to take priority and not allow me to use Android Auto? @ESTI Inc Can you have bluetooth devices such as a Samsung Gear S3 specifically connect to Eye instead of connecting to your iPhone? Also, if it's let's say 20$ more if you want the charging pad add a 115$ option to get the regular eye with the charging pad because there are still 95$ eyes left and if people select that instead of the 95$ one it means more people could et the 95$ option Also you would have better chance of hitting stretch if you added more 129$ 4g I got the super early bird and was wondering how much do I need to add to get 4g Hi, if I connect the Eye with an iPhone to a PC/Mac will iTunes detect the iPhone while explorer detects the Android at the same time? For buying more of the eyes can you get a discont on adding more storage 59 is a lot for 4 devices 236 I know you can use as but internal can't be changed and I'd like to get the highest People say that 64GB its good for internal storage and install apps but... those expansion can be achieved by micro sd card right? We can use this sd for internal storage? Ok thanks for letting me know. I thought if the goal was met then everyone would get 64GB, I'll just add a 200GB through Amazon for $78ish or so USD. Thanks Hey I got the early committed subscription. I would like to change to the 4g model. How much do I have to add? If the $500,000 is not met, you have the option to add $59 I believe to get your Eye with 64GB internally instead of 16GB. If the goal is met then you don't have to add anything. Hi, I'm a bit confusing now. I wish to have the on-board storage to 64gb ads-on. I must add 59 in my pledge now(before you closed your campaign) or just wait it unlocked then only can choose the add-on and raise my pledge? Can calls be answered/made from the Eye android screen with the additional SIM cards? Hi @ESTI team, Regarding US LTE bands, have you guys decided on what you be supporting on EYE? Around 42% of your backers are from US. So, hopefully you will please US backers. Hi I am from India , do I need to pay extra import duty while case being delivered to me by courier?if yes how would I do it? Hi everybody, for most backers, the function adobtable storage seems unknown. I would like to briefly describe it. Android has had limited support for removable storage in one form or another since the beginning. With Marshmallow, the new Adoptable storage feature lets you turn your removable SD card option into a more or less permanent (and no longer removable) part of the device. The whole thing is simple, really, and most of the confusion surrounding Adoptable storage is easy to clear up. There are a few things to keep in mind so you understand how it works and what it's doing. If you have Nougat and a microSD card slot, you can turn that external storage into integrated internal storage. Head to Setting > Storage & USB. At the bottom you'll see the SD card details, with the option to format and use as internal storage. You then get to manage and move content to this partition once done. Once a storage device is adopted, it becomes part of the system and is no longer removable. Sure you can physically remove it, but you'll be prompted to put it back while apps and services crash on your phone or tablet. It's adopted — taken in and loved by the system, and made part of the whole. This means Adoptable storage is really only useful for two things: An SD card placed in a phone or tablet and never to be removed A USB storage device attached to your Android TV box, and never to be removed. Thanks to Android Central and Pocket-Lint <url>€)... the most kickstarter will send it to a location in Europe and than to the backer. Sending from China directly, than the Eye is to expensive... sorry You should send a prototype to other youtuber's like: Techsmartt, EverythingApplePro and Jonathan Morrison. 2 questions... 1. Where can I find link for the referral program.... 2. I am currently working in China and I don't know if I will be here after July.. when can I change my shipping address ? And thank you for considering both the goals at 500k... We definitely need some CAD drawings or something to give us an idea on how this battery pack looks like b4 the campaign ends. Are there pictures available of the case itself? Or at least the prototype? *edited* Thanks a lot for the change in the goals. This move will make many of the current and upcoming backers happier. :) Maybe you should also give some more samples to Youtubers for their review to gain the popularity of this case. Thanks again. Thanks a lot for the change in the goals. This move will make many of the current or upcoming backers happier. :) Hey, is there a chance to add aptX Support to the Bluetooth Modul? As the iPhone does not support this high qualitive BT audio codec, it would be great if you do! :) Sorry naive here but how to add the $20 up charge for wireless charger! Hi I just did read that the shipping will done from china Does that mean , i live in europe i will have to pay the custome fees as well ??? Please let me know Bring more rewards for super early birds at $129 and d campaign will run faster... How much I need to add for Wireless charging unit and Metal tag for car mount? I actually agree that you would have a much better chance of reaching the stretch goals if you added more of the single 4G devices for the $149 price tag. I think the reason you're having issues boosting the campaign beyond what you have is that people are turned off by the lack of this option. I know some have said this before, but I just want to reiterate that, as a salesperson and businessman that has worked in CPG for years, the reason your campaign has plateaued is because this option has expired. Just throwing it out there! How much RAM does the device have? (Not storage, actual processing RAM)? 1GB, 2GB, 4GB? I think there's a spelling mistake in the FAQ question about Eye connecting to the internet. Instead of saying "it consumes a lot of power" you said "it consumes a low of power" When the $500,000 stretch goal was still extended battery, that the time I decide to support the project and backed 2 of them. But now it changed, I am not too happy about it. That how I see it, carry 2 extra 64 gb micro sd card won't take much space or weight but carry an extra power bank would be a problem for me. So good luck for the project, I will come back in after it hit $900,000 goal..... @Fran San personally I want the battery pack, so if I don't get along with the eye using it as a case for my iPhone, then I could use it as a alternative storage media devise, storage for my iPhone and potentially separate phone. All which I have mention with 10ah of battery would be incredible. I see the reason for the extra flash storage for people that use loads of apps on the eye. Personally I'll get an micro sd card expansion for music, photos, etc. I'll back up and agree with the earlier comments about waterproofing. As a backer, I feel it's essential to match the iPhone 7's water resistance rating. Can you guys add more 4G versions for around 119-129$ so we will be able to reach the stretch goals?! As i myself would also upgrade I have one question for "batterie" fans. Do you want to use the "Eye" without an iPhone inside ? Or do you want to carry your iPhone and the "Eye" separately ? Its going to be close so lets not get distracted. Is this some sort of joke, the survey wasn't even out 24 hours, making it unfair and invalid. Not everyone checks there email that often. So of course I didn't get to vote in the survey! Unbelievable ESTI are going to do clearly what ever they want, because the memory expansion only won by 1.5 votes. So potentially I could of made this a draw!!! The only thing fair now would be to offer both option, or the original stretch pledge (the original stretch pledge was the reason I pledged). If not, and the stretch pledge is met without battery expansion, then I'll have to withdraw my pledge. Many thanks Okay. When campaign ends and kickstarter is closed will you open an Indiegogo if so will you add that revenue to ours so let's say we reach 500000 and they reach 400000 will that unlock powerbank I agree with the waterproofing Come on let's forget about the optional upgrade from 16GB to 64GB of on board storage... This case needs to be waterproof to match the iPhone 7's IP67 water resistant rating! This is what is really needed. Do a survey asking that and you will see that is what people actually want. You can buy a 64+ GB Micro SD Card for way cheaper than $59 on Amazon. And an external batteries are super cheap and very competitive a lot cheaper than $24! Give us a Waterproof Case just like the iPhone :) When the product is completed where will they ship from? I am also on the side for keeping the original 500k stretch goal as an extension in battery life because it seems more beneficial than adding in built-in storage that can just be added anyways via micro sd card. In the end of it all, I hope that the ones that backed this project originally, with this feasible stretch goal in mind, get the opportunity to get the expanded battery stretch goal that got me and many others excited about it in the first place. Hello . I backed the device that didn't have the 4G ,but have since changed my mind. How much would I need to change my pledge to? Do I just need to cancel my original pledge and choose the one for 4G. I would also like to add the additional storage(64G) and the powerbank. I must of misunderstood the comments lol thanks for the quick reply and can't wait to get my hands on this case Hi just backed this just read a comment the eye can't connect to hotspot on iPhone but it does by BLE what does that? Hi I've added $20 to my pledge. Is there any thing else I need to do to receive the wireless charger? It looks like some bakers don't understand le concept... 1° Wireless charging ability is free if you buy the eye, but the station to charge is NOT free (add 20.-) 2° The two first stretch goals (Power bank and the upgrade memory) are NOT free (we have to pay extra money if we want it) and they were NOT free before the switch, NEVER. The Power bank is not magic, it will be inside the eye, substituting the iPhone... If you want the Power bank, you can't put the iPhone inside the eye case. It means you have to carry 2 smartphones separately (the iPhone and the eye). If having two smartphones with you is not a problem, you can buy an external Power bank and the eye (put the iPhone inside). you will have the same result. 3° The 64 GB upgrade is usefull to have some apps inside the eye (Android system is using between 6 and 8 GB of the 16 GB) and you can use the SD card reader for documents, video, pictures, etc. 4° The 64 GB upgrade is not available yet. We have to wait until the 1st stretch goal is reached (500'000.-) Hope it will help... This is the phone case that one side will be apple stuff and the other side Android right ? Add 4,000 earlyburd eye 4g at 129.99 and you whould hit 900000 in few days those at that price where beat seller I pledge $119 for a eye without 4g but now I think I want one with 4g how do I go about switching and with a 4g eye can I still use it only using wifi ? I just added $20 to my $129 4G case for a wireless charger. I have already added +$20 for wireless charger Thanks for quick reply and survey form. This is confusing. $59 for 64GB is costly but internal storage would be useful.. same with PowerBank, it is cheaper at $24 and it would useful too. I want both. I am considering to buy wireless charger + power bank + 64GB storage. What if you consider 128GB internal storage at $100, I am sure you will definitely get unexpected result of poll... Well, I genuinely feel like I've been listened to, now that this new survey is out. If the survey comes back and the results don't reflect my own opinion, then at least ESTI has given it a fair shot, and allowed the backers to have a say. I will support whatever $500k stretch goal is decided based on the new survey. I'm much happier now! Good work guys! :) Hi i am still indecisive about the powerbank. Mainly because i need to see some pics/video on how it will look. How tick it will be Hi, I have a couple questions 1. For the wireless charger what kind of power plug is it going to have? I am in Canada and we use the North American socket, will you ship with that? 2. Can you guarantee at this stage that you will have software which allows us to switch between Apple Carplay and Android Auto? Thanks Internal storage is a must! You can always have a power bank or turn your wifi off. There are ways to save power. But some apps require internal storage on android and won't save on an external SD card. Which is one of the reasons I switched to iPhone. 256 gb iPhone, 64 gb eye, 256 gb external SD card. Over a half a TB. Plus I already have a sweet power bank. Better give an option at stretch goal am happy with 64 GB though Is there a switch on Eye for charging the iPhone? as i wouldn't want it to charge all the time. Thanks in advance. How about adding Combined Stretched goal wherein backers have options to add power bank, extra storage or both? I'm reconsidering to buy 64gb storage and power bank and wireless charger too. I mean I want all three addons. If you can provide small discount to backer who opt for all the three add ons? Once again thanks for crafting wonderful product. I personally like the new expanded storage goal better. The power bank was good, but it's not 10000mAh in the case, rather its another battery you stick inside the case, so you can't have the phone and the added battery inside the case at the same time. I'd rather just get a separate power bank so that I can charge the case and phone while still using all the awesome features when together. It would be better if you stick to your old goal of powerbank at 500k. Plus i personally think that you should give it as free of charge once d goal is achieved to the backers.. Anyways previous goal was much better. Completely gutted about the stretch goal unlocked being changed, the original goal for a battery expansion was a seller for me. Questioning my pledge now. Hey guys, the original $500k stretch goal power bank is an add-on, not for free. "Add 7200mAh (on top of 2800mAh) for a total of 10000mAh, enabling Eye to act as a portable power bank ($24)." - From their campaign page @Herman Smestad-Samuelsen The Eye case already comes with wireless charging capabilities, you only need to add-on $20 for the dedicated wireless charger. No no no.... not interested in paying $59 and get 64gb.... I was very happy with power bank stretch goal... kindly give backers an option to either choose the power bank or storage or both.. when 500k goal is unlocked. power comes before storage storage can be replaced by a memory card if it's 2800 mah i will need a power bank to make them work for the rest of the day. If I ad 40$ will i get both the wireless charging and the charger? Disappointed. :(. I already have 128gb memory card ready. All I need is more power to the eye and the powerbank that fit in the eye instead of the iphone design seems awesome. But now you changed the pledge :(. It feels like supplying power to the eye and charging the iphone, a 2800mah battery wont last long. :( and I dont want to bring a powerbank with a cord while outside. And the idea of eye working on its own without iphone but will still look like a phone is very great :D. But now its not possible :(. Totally disappointed :( Dear Eye Inventor, I am deeply sad to heard that you are changing the goal for 500k with optional add on additional storage to 64gb with extra charges...those expansion can be achieved by micro sd card right? Perhaps additional free power capacity is something more desirable and useful for backer. Could you please reconsider to give optional that backer can choose either they wish to go for storage or extra battery capacity? Please... Your sincere supporter, Jeffrey Chan @Edward. First must reached the goal and then it will be unlocked. Don't pledge yet until they reached their goal. Will the lightning plug in the case be MFI certificate? Will it be not regconised by the iphone after a few iphone firmware update?? Can eye without cellular connectivity connect to wifi? Just upgraded my pledge for 2X of the eye by $118 to get both of them upgraded to 64 GB! But there was no where to leave notes or to let you know what the added amount was for. Is this automatically known because of the amount?? Thanks Ed ESTI, I wanted to send a small thank you for your constant updates and communications. While this should seem like a simple task, it does not happen as often as it should in the Kickstarter community. This boggles my mind because I would have thought the inventor would love to promote and talk about their product. I have talked about this project to many people because its exciting and new. The product has so much potential, and it is one of the first products I am truly looking forward to. Like a child waiting for their birthday to get presents, this product can not come soon enough. You are doing a great job. Please keep the updates and info coming. Regards, Robert from Eye 4G spec, "Up to 300Mbps SIM cardDual sim dual standby Or 1 Micro SIM Card and 1 Micro SD Card" Will Eye 4G come with 2 SIM slot or 1 Micro SIM Card and 1 Micro SD Card? Will both Eye and Eye 4G come with micro SD card slot? Will both Eye and Eye 4G come with micro SD card slot? Will the cover automatically charge iphone when connected ? Is there an estimated production time line? To get wireless charging you go into your account and add $20 to your pledge. Also @Creator, instead of having a 7200 mAh battery pack how about having a 3000 mAh battery pack for a lower stretch goal? How to select the add on ,i want the wireless charger? Please help because i had no options while pledging. Will the finish of the case be of beter quality. Looking at the photos now it looks very cheap .... So I added $160 to my pledge to get 2 wireless chargers and expand storage to both units. So it came out to a $350 pledge. Is that correct? cmon! i was really hyped for the powerbank goal :( I would prefer the powerbank as a free upgrade instead we will receive a payed ad on if needed... sorry that's a good deal for you not the backer... Hi! I would like to know what size sim cards will fit to create dual or triple sim capability? Micro, nano? Also, can one receive calls with both sims in 'on' mode or does one have to switch and turn off one sim to operate another? Thank you! $20 is for the wireless charging dock. It's listed under accessory add on I see you changed the $500k goal to be the 64GB internal storage from the $900K goal in the campaign literature. Way to go. I'll increase my pledge by $59 to include it now. If everyone else that wants the 64GB internal storage does that we will reach the $500k goal no problem! Is there any other features that i have to pay extra to get besides the wireless charging feature? Can I know the connection for the voice call of Android using iPhone speaker and mic? Over BLE, USB or others? Wait we have to pay extra for wireless charging ?? I'm agree about switching external batterie with 64gb storage. Lot of people have already an external batterie and the 64gb storage is a very good way to improve our user experience. Getting ansy! Can't wait! I XCITED! Will adoptable storage be supported? Definitely switch those two. I'm sure we'll be able to meet that goal quicker. Also just for confirmation if I want to add another eye and or a wireless charger will I still be on the same shipping queue spot? Any over heat solutions? Yes, i like it.. 64gb internal storage for 500k stretch goal. Will the final product also have a small lip above the iphone side for drop protection? Are all of the different add-ons that we need to add to our pledges to get listed somewhere? I've checked the FAQ and the main campaign page and didn't see them there and I don't have time to go through all of the comments. Thank you! That's a very good idea to change the 900k goal and merge with the battery pack... But how much do we need to add then for 64 gb or it will be free :D Yes else itch to 64 but also you had a thing for the first five backers to get there's for free do you think you could change that to top ten I'm kinda sad cause I was 6 Yes else itch to 64 but also you had a thing for the first five backers to get there's for free do you think you could change that to top ten I'm kinda sad cause I was 6 Yes please switch the battery pack with the 64 GB internal memory. @Creators Yes I think I'd rather have the 64GB internal instead of the battery pack even though both are a must but I always carry my 20,400 mAh battery and my (3) 3000 mAh batteries w/ my backpack that they fit in. And anyways a 200GB microSD card on Amazon costs around $75 USD while a 256GB costs $133 to $199 USD but keep the battery still up as there is still time which we may meet. Yes switch Yes, I think it's a great idea to replace the 64GB internal storage $900K goal, with the battery bank $500K goal. I don't think I would get the battery but would definitely upgrade to 64GB internal storage. Can never have enough whereas can always recharge if need to. I'm very excited for this project. My job requires more than 1 phone line and it'll be very convenient to have multiple lines in one device for in Canada or internationally. What is the shock resistance on the device? IMHO not everybody knows, that a stock android (like we'll get it with Eye) have the "install on / move to sd card" feature since 6.0 marshmallow...@ESTI: maybe it's a good idea to put this information in the FAQ and the campaign description also see: <url>émon Go. Will it be able to run Pokemon Go? Which part of the case has the slot for the sim cards and micro SD card? Can you please post images for this on the 4.7" iPhone Lol@Pokemon Go. When can we expect the product to ship to backers? More specifically in the U.S.A. It doesn't look like your stretch goal will be reached unless you add more early birds at lower cost then ones available now Hello Everyone, Will the case have wifi support? Thanks. Best regards. As it does not look likely that any of the multi boot goals will be reached, is it possible that at some point in the future multi boot could be added? Is it strong enough to run Pokémon go? May I know if Android Auto or Apple CarPlay is activated when plugged into a car? Are we able to select the one preferred? Thanks! That's a very good idea.. can this happen ? To engrave initials or just 1st name on the eye ? To need to add the backer number though Hey l. Just thought it may be a cool idea if it's not to much of a cost. But it would be nice to brag about being first to have an "eye" so would it be possible to engrave the backer number and initials on the eye it self with shipment? I was wondering whether it is possible to add the capability to attach add-on lens to this case, for example, Exolens-Zeiss lens or the OOWA lens which had also a successful campaign. This give your case a wider usage for people who want more functionality in a limited size without adding much cost. @Sean, I believe you go into your account and add $20 for wireless charging Hi I have added 54 $ to my pledge please ship 4g version I appreciate your answer and I am glad to be a backer. How can I go about getting the wireless charger? This user's account has been deleted. Yes, It will be possible to insert a 256 GB SD Card... but will it be possible to install apps in the SD card and use them ? If yes, will be the speed using the app in the SD card similar than a app in the internal memory ? I don't speak small apps, but "big" apps. I don't think so. Your project is amazing, I don't say anything negative, but as you said you did choices. I can understand your choices. It's a shame that you don't have more success to reach the goals. Hey. Does the iPhone have to be turned on for the eye to be on? I plan on taking a trip out the country and want to use my eye for communication versus paying higher charges for out of country roaming charges? Usually when I travel out the country I turn my phone off to avoid those charges completely. I'm concerned about horsepower for running apps. While the ram and internal storage are more than enough, will the CPU be able to handle graphical rendering for games? Nothing insane but low to small level games? Hi I need to go for 4g version early bird how much I need to pay extra Looks like that the 900 000 streach goal will not be reached... I think that many of bakers will cancel their pfledge without 64GB internal memory. I'm one of them. When are you planning on applying for MFI certification to keep up your projected Aug2017 rollout? Hey just saw Android O launched and it's awesome, wonder if eye's hardware is good enough for it? Any possibility of adding VoLTE as a new stretch goal? Or a combined goal of 64gb internal storage + Multi Boot + VoLTE? Just read again and saw there is an SD slot. How does that work for IPhone? Why exactly can we back up to the card? Isn't ios very restrictive with what goes in/out of the phone? @Creator, has there been any thought about having Micro SD slots included in the eye? Rather than SIM card slots, I think extra storage would be awesome Is using the ear piece and microphone via Lighting really possible? Would have thought Apple got some hardware/software restrictions there - or have you found a away to circumvent this? Guys just saying this product with eye will be amazing <url>​ onboard Is that UFS2.0? 300Mbps 4G It have 2CA right? How about 2CA combination? P20 chipset can support 4G+3G will you open it? It is very useful in many nations What is the connection port spec? Will it be a USB type-C? What a killer project! Thank you for not only the idea but for putting in the enormous effort to bring this to market! This literally changes everything and provides interesting competition and enhancements in the cellular marketplace. I currently carry both a iPhone 6S and a HTC Desire 530 running Android because of features I need in both on a regular basis so you will be freeing up some room in my pockets! I know you have noted numerous times to US based backers to check with their carrier to see if the bands you have identified... * GSM: 850(B5)/900(B8)/1800(B3)/1900(B2) * WCDMA: 850(B5)/900(B8)/1900(B2)/2100(B1) * LTE FDD: 2100(B1)/1800(B3)/2600(B7)/800(B20) ... are compatible with their service. My goal would be to use a different carrier than what I currently use to provide redundancy for cellular coverage. Could you please confirm at least one US carrier will be compatible with the Eye4G? I don't care which carrier it is(AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile or Sprint) but since I am not an expert in cellular bands and don't want to attempt to confirm something I don't know enough about it would be beneficial to all of the backers in the US to know which carrier will be supported. It is pointless for me to purchase the 4G version, which is what I am currently backing, without knowing for sure that at least one US carrier will work with the Eye4G. Again thanks for a great product. I am excited to use it! When plugged into the computer will the computer see the iPhone, Eye, or both? I am really hoping that both can be seen as I want to use this for software development so that I no longer have to keep an android phone along with me all the time when working on cross platform apps. In terms of OS will you be shipping with Android 7.1.2 as it is projected to come out in April which should give you some time to create a build before the August ship date. And in terms of OS updates does this mean you will provide future major android updates such as Android O (August projected release) and Android P (Obviously Android P would be in 2018) or will it just be security updates? Keeping up with major updates would be a great bonus to this project. Oh oh, VoLTE is a deal breaker for me, Since I am in India I know everyone will be using VoLTE. How complicated is that to make it happen? @ESTI Any stretch goal plan to increase RAM on Eye to 4GB? @Sameer Campaign page already states that devices ship with "Android 7.1 Nougat OS". In all the demo videos, it appears that the Android version is 6.x. Since the devices are not shipped yet, what are the chances that you`ll be sending Android 7.x ? i choose the family pack. Can i pick it for different iPhone like 2 iPhone 7 plus, one iPhone 7 and one iPhone 6 Whats the date for the Live Demo? @ESTI Inc. I think a lot of people don't understand that this is a SUB-DEVICE, NOT a full, fledged Android phone slapped on the back of an iPhone. This is NOT meant to be your daily driver. I LOVE what you've created here and can NOT WAIT to get it! I CONTINUALLY have a 2nd Android phone ready for me to hop into for half a day before I get angry and go back to my iPhone. This is the answer to my prayers! Android has SO MANY better things more than iPhone, but just isn't stable enough, nor does it have good enough battery for me. But this, this is just AMAZING! Keep up the great work! I, like a lot of people on here, REALLY APPRECIATE IT!!! Definitely looks like we'll get to the $500,000 stretch goal for the 7200 mAh battery but curious on if you have a prototype of that or a CAD drawing to show us backers on how it will look mounted. And surely hope we make it to the $900,000 stretch goal for the 64GB internal memory. @Thomas Aarts, Obviously, You don't know about processors. Not a matter. They speak about one processor. This processor has 8 cores... 4 of them are working 2.3 GHz (usefull for apps that need power) the others 4 are working 1.6 GHz (for standard process and low consumption - better for battery). I hope my english is good enough to explain and you understand what I mean. Work 3G? Greetings! My question is what is your progress on developing iPhone side software (app for integration), and what is your contingency plan if it's not accepted by apple? Also I know it's early but could you estimate how far from mass production ready the prototypes are? CPU 2.3 GHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 1.6 GHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 Why are there multiple cpu's listed ? Does the 4G have a faster chip or is it random how do you get the 2,3Ghz model? I had the $129 pledge for the 4G Eye and I wanted to get a WiFi Eye as well, but I accidentally changed my pledge to 2 4G Eye at $239. Is there any way to get my old pledge amount back and add the WiFi Eye? I wouldn't mind keeping the 2 4G Eye pledge if you have a more definite answer about supporting the bands I need for my carrier. I'm somewhat surprised that you don't support most US Carriers when I'm sure a majority of your backers are from the US. Does it Supports VoLTE? iPhone 8 is rumored to have wireless charging built-in. If so, how does it affect wireless charging on Eye or vice-versa? Thank you Thank you for your answer. I understand your view and maybe you are right (you thought about this project for à long time). If there is no way to upgrade de internal memory, I think I will cancel my pledge. I will Think about It. Internal memory is for app and external memory is for Data. I use lot of apps and 16GB is definitely not enough for me. But don't change your way, the Project is amazing. I agree with the creator. It's a second device/add on to your iPhone. 16 gigs with and expandable ad car option is plenty. Keep up the great work. I'm so looking forward to getting my eye! Will this be standard shipping or is there a way we can get like overnight shipping? To be honest, I don't care the powerbank. I have a lot or them. Half of streach goals are useless. Upgrading the internal memory is interesting and usefull. I can't do anything with 16GB. Who can ? 64GB is a minimum. 128GB would be great. I like the IP67 and the trial boot (Android, Ubuntu and Windows Phone) idea's. This would be the ultime smartphone for a geek (software développer). But, Your streach goals are to ambitiouse. So, no chance. Hello, I have a couple questions. I added $20 to my previous pledge, will that get me the wireless charger? Also I thought I saw a headphone jack in the case, if there is a headphone jack, will we be able to use it for the iPhone 7 and 7 plus? Hey am wondering for the extra batt part and 64 gb can we purchase it already ? I don't understand the part where by extra batt when not covering with eye . I'm looking at the LTE bands you support. None of the bands are Sprint compatible. Would you be able to add those bands so I can use my extra Sprint sim card in the Eye? Thanks. Why not 256 gb for last stretch goal... make it the best product then... By the time this kickstarter ends will you support us 4g What about one last stretch goal to add internal 128gb option at $59 or nearby? Hi Team This is my first backing am thrilled, do all stretch goals need additional payment or is it just for 16 to 64 GB Upgrade I was wondering if it would be possible to come out with a model that completely encases the phone? Adding the screen protector to the case. Or would that option just be too costly to add om? Question regarding the "battery case" function: is it going to be just a hardware feature (that is, you press a button and the case starts charging the iPhone) or there will be some kind of software management (like a dedicated menu setting where one can choose parameters like the % under which the case starts charging, the order in which the case and the iPhone are charged, ...)? 59 for 64gb Is that UFS2.1 or UFS2.0? Also will it support companies like metro pcs, cricket etc. I have a question about the 4g Model. Can you use the eye as a mobile hotspot for the iPhone it's attached to? Please add language to Japanese And add band19(4g)&band6(3G) I hope sucsess this plan Thank you I agree with others here that for 64gb an additional price of 59$ is too much.. If the stretch goals reach to 900,000$ so 64gb should be free... or you can put total 256gb internal memory then the cost may be ok.. but just for 64gb.. it's pretty high.. A question about the power bank stretch goal: When the power bank is mounted in, will there be a lightning to lightning connection to power the iPhone or what way do you chose to power the iPhone? Will there be an additional power cord in the equipment? A second question about the lightning port and support for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto: Usually when I connect my iPhone with my new OPEL INSIGNIA with CarPlay/Android Auto Support, the Phone will connect automatically with the entertainment system. When the iPhone and the Eye connecting over the same port, how can I choose which OS I want to use? Could you test it? If so, could you post a video? IMHO (car) connectivity is big selling point for the eye. thx again and big thx for answering all the backer question. (y) :-)) Any option for additional storage? I'm willing to pay more for a 256GB! Also, will the 7 Plus case work with the 6s Plus? I current own both devices, but when the 8 comes out, I'll be selling my 7 Plus but keeping my 6s Plus as a backup/travel device. Lastly, can you make a bundle with 1 4G and 1 WiFi? I don't think I can wait that long for the iPhone 8 Eye. I'll get one for the 7 for now and wait for the 8! Thanks for considering my stretch goal request for the additional storage. We are all know that 900K is an easy stretch. But I am afraid the people won't be upgrading to 64G for an additional $ 59 since they are better off with SD card storage and it is cheap! I am not an expert but $ 59 is a lot of money you can almost bye a complete "eye" if you were an super early adopter. So my request is lower the the money and break it up with smaller storage like 32 & 64. This way people have less money will have a chance to upgrade their storage also I am sure double boot and triple boot (windows) will gonna need a hell lot of space than the 16GB. Can you detail out the differences on the functioning of Eye and Eye 4G on campaign page, so that it clears the confusion for many of them. If my Eye is defect and destroys my iPhone will you replace both? This is my first project I'm backing at Kickstart and I really think it's awesome! I got two quick questions: 1. It's the Eye screen always on? If so, wouldn't be useful to be able to turn it off for battery saving? 2. Any details on the standards required (bus speed, etc) for the external memory card? <url>"more internal space + Qualcomm" at discounted price? Thanks for adding 64gb as stretch goals with add-ons. $59 seems to be little costly. Can you modify that stretch goal to add options to choose between 32gb, 64gb and 128gb? Hi I am curious regarding the battery. Does it serve as a battery pack when the iPhone is low on juice and there is no power outlets available. The second question is with regards to delivery, now that the project has reached its funding, is there an estimate when these products will start shipping? I am worried as I previously backed popslate which seemed promising but as per the news they failed to deliver to the backers. Thank you for your time That's what I thought. Thanks for the clarification. Curious to know more details about Eye - does it generate its own hotspot (the android side) where wifi is not available? Hello! Quick Question, will there be an option to choose when you want the case to charge your iPhone, even when the case is on? I have a question that probably already got asked, I have an iPhone 7 plus, what if this thing gets dropped and falls right on your screen? Hi! I have a quick question. So I know that the eye has no speakers, so if you want to watch a video and you don't have headphones would the sound be sent and played through the iPhone's speakers? Thank you very much! ""@Jay M. W. Ice "If you want to hit 3 million you might need to add more early birds" You're right! We'll update it. Thank you!"" By update to you mean your stretch or the number of early birds How many languages will be supported on eye's android? I have a 24Gb data subscription on my iPhone. Will Eye - or vice versa for that matter - be able to use this bundle instead of having to get another data bundle? may i know what is the device that can be compared to eye? the closest specs? Not my first backing but it's been some of the most entertaining back and forth dialogue between a cool product and it's wary would-be supporters, count me in! Can I know how heavy will the final device be? If you want to hit 3 million you might need to add more early birds Gorilla Glass? The rumour is that apple is not useing lightning connector in the 8 if this happens I assume this we'll be addressed in the 8 version of the case! all the items you mentioned like wireless charging screen size dual sim.. are they all included in the price or are they stretch goals are extra money? I would prefer increasing inbuilt storage (16GB) as a stretch goal. Since I wanted to use all 3 sims. I believe it is a hybrid sim right? Also, Mediatek always suffers performance issue. I know Qualcomm costs more, but I think it will be better than Mediatek. I backed this but well most likely get a iphone 8 in the future well you be making a case for this? well it have dual sim card or extra storage? How basic well the android side be? I mean well it compare to samsung 8? This is my first project I'm backing (very excited about this btw). How long do we have to pick a model and color after the survey comes? Can someone answer me a really basic probably stupid question. It doesn't go into very much in the details for the campaign so I guess I have 2 questions. If the phone has 4G what is the big difference between an eye that has 4G vs one that does not? Also, what is the lazor game and what does it entail? Let's say you watch Netflix on that beautiful screen on the Eye side...how much view time until the battery dies? You don't have a side micro-USB in addition to Qi-charging, do you and why not??? Basically, my point is you can't use the Eye while it needs to charge. Battery is small so my guess is less than 1 hour of viewing streaming video but one can't even use an accessory portable battery or a wired charge cable to keep things going. In short, I encourage you to add this functionality. kicktraq says if you keep your momentum you'll get a low 1,500,000 or a high of 3 mil plus Hi folks, you got me support this project, so shut up and take my money! :D But all jokes aside! I've changed from the Super Early Bird non 4G to Early Bird 4G + 20$ for the wireless charger. Hopefully you'll be able to deliver a finished product. :-) Just a dumb question more: Is there a chance, that you'll officially support Google Daydream? Would it be possible to start a poll with the community hear? I would love a Google Daydream Support in the final product!!! THX and all the best for our project! :-) @creator what different tge wireless charger accessory than Q wireless charger already in the market? Done...thanks. This user's account has been deleted. No one knows for sure, but the next iPhone will have an additional model. Many analysts say that that Apple will get a model other than the 7S and the 7S Plus. The other model comes with 5.8 screen and will be available later in 2017 or early in 2018. I don't know how many of you will want that version, but I doubt that ESTI will guarantee to come up with a case for that model. How does one add the wireless charger accessory to pledge? *goal of 95,000 not 300,000 "@Jay M. W. Ice "Will it be waterproof, Also could you add in a speaker" 1) Although Eye has only one weakness point in terms of water resistance which is the Lightning port, it isn't water resistant. It takes a little design change and therefore more budget. The Eye will be water resistant only if we'll be able to reach 3,000,000 goal. 2) We can't add a speaker. The lack of a speaker is one of the reasons we were able to make Eye so thin." 1) I don't think you will ever reach 3,000,000 if you don't add more early birds because if they need to pay the normal price for the case they might as well wait for it to come out, especially considering you hit your 300,000 goal. Additionally you might want to write on the home page of your product that if you hit 3,000,000 you will water proof it. "@Jay M. W. Ice "Also I did 95$ donation then started thinking and realized I would be out of country next year so having the sim card would be very handy but the 129$ for the sim card slot was already out so o couldn't change it" I'm sorry to hear that. You can still get it in $149 which is much much less than the retail which is $229." Unfortunately for me the difference between 129$ and 149$ for me is big as I am in high school and all the money to spend is the money I make by working at my synagogue every week and I only make 20$ a week. Hi, First of all, congratulations on a great project! I just had a few questions: 1. If I am using Whatsapp/snapchat on my iphone, will I be able to configure Eye to use the same account as my iphone as well? 2. Does Eye (not Eye 4G) have Wifi capabilities? Will it be able to cellular services of my iPhone? Thank you. Thanks for answering all those questions. it is obvious you guy have a very clear goal and I like the idea of not inventing parts which would increase costs. Hi, i just backed the kickstarter and i wondered if you could putt inn ann extra SD-Card even though i dont have the 4G version? This user's account has been deleted. Also I did 95$ donation then started thinking and realized I would be out of country next year so having the sim card would be very handy but the 129$ for the sim card slot was already out so o couldn't change it Also could you add in a speaker Will it be waterproof, Not sure if this has been addressed so far, but it is concerning that a million dollar Indiegogo campaign extremely similar to this one just announced failure close to the time this campaign started. It creates some suspicion and prompts caution. Not making accusations, but deeply concerning. popSLATE 2 - Smart Second Screen for iPhone <url>​ Hey guys, great job putting all of this together. As someone who considers themselves a bit of a tinkerer, do you think that you will be releasing the kernel source tree for your android architecture with the release of this device? I think that would very seriously win over more of the open source community with this product. i already pledged when choose color black or white? Just to clarify, does Eye include a charger? Is there a drop test we can see? The case looks like it's made of cheap gummy material from the videos and pictures. forbes said something interesting what if you dont get google certification what is your backup plan? it says you plan on using UMI but apparently not all of their phones get accepted. so really big question what is you backup os? I understand you will be able to make calls from the model with the 4G card because of the simcard slot but what about the non-4G edition? Any way to BLE that? And I pray im not wrong but to have a working prototype shows a working product and only need funding to mass produce. I hope they clean some lines maybe redesign a little to help with mass production but it seems like the money has already been spent for designing "The Kickstarter campaign says the first units will deliver in August of 2017, a timeline that's likely going to be difficult to meet, so if you're interested in this product, it may be better to hold off until it is available outside of Kickstarter." this is what Macrumor said which makes sense i dont expect an august release more hoping for it Hi Creator. You considerate to do in the future one mix like iPhone iOS + Smartphone like Spen Edition (Galaxy Note) Would be awesome guys to have one iPhone with Spen + Air Command software!!! I will fell in love with that! Many websites including macrummors suggest it's too good to be true and they do not recommend backing this kickstarter project. Should we be worried ? Hello, I was wondering if you guys are going to release an easy root tool along with the case and if not how are we going to go about rooting it? Hi, cant wait to see Unbox Therapy review your prototype! I do have have a few questions, will there be an option to opt for better specs? Anything close to a Google Pixel maybe? What are your policies on refunds? Should the product get delayed way beyond expected delays or unsatisfactory use of The Eye? I wish you success and hope you exceed the $15 million stretch goal so we can boot into Ubuntu and Windows 10 Mobile on top of iOS and Android. That would be exciting if anything. What will happen if the next iPhone has wireless charging? Will your wireless charging interfere with the built in charging? Will the case for the next iPhone drop wireless charging if they have their own? If they do have their own wireless charging what if your case interferes with it? What are the specs of the internals? Cpu ? Ram? Etc This is quite confusing.. 1) so by default, this have got 2 different battery life? My iPhone has its own independent battery, while the eye has its own independent battery? 2) however, when charging, both will be charged together? 3) the eye can also be used as a supplementary battery charger for my iPhone? This sounds Abit too good to be true right? If so, what the radiation readings gonna be like? I'm worried that this could be quite harmful? How can I use my iPhone number without switching my SIM card back and forth Would love to have the case designed so that regardless which side is face down, the glass will not rub against the surface. This user's account has been deleted. Are we given the option to choose a 7 or 7plus? You have to go to the campaign page. Where is the video Introducing the eye case? I have been scrolling through comments and can not find it. Could I and how could I use the USB data port of the unit? (For example, ADB or even OTG function) Could I and how could I use the USB data port of the unit? (For example, ADB or even OTG function) Could I and how could I use the USB data port of the unit? (For example, ADB or even OTG function) Could I and how could I use the USB data port of the unit? (For example, ADB or even OTG function) @DAC They have been posting demo videos in the comments section I backed this, but let's be real, this *has* to be fake, right? The sum of its parts, even at wholesale price, exceeds $150. Then consider the form factor, and apparently cramming a 2600mah battery in there... there's just no way. I hope it's real, I really do. But this absolutely seems like a scam. Prove it's real by providing a video with a working demo. Would we get to select the phone size after the 30 days? I was wondering if you brought the eye with 4G access are you able to use the cellular compatibility of the iPhone it is connected to? Thank you very much for your future response I bought the two 4g model option for my brother and mother. However, they have a 7 and a 6plus. I will be able to choose two separate models for them correct? Meaning, I won't just get two 6 plus models or 7 models, correct? Also, in the comments you said that the case isn't a phone, and only has "cellular capabilities". This will be able to take calls correct? The description of the product says that it will let you have three numbers. Also, do I select the wait option when the survey goes out? Sorry for all the questions, and thank you for taking the time to read this. I look forward to your response. @ESTI: Yeah, switching reward is a possibility, but I wouldn't mind having the option to keep my slot while doing so. I thought about backing Kingdom Death the second time it ran and the first one was the first board-game I saw on Kickstarter and back then I thought it was expensive for a board-game but it would of course have had amazing value. Anyway for the second there was early birds for lots of tiers and I didn't knew which one I actually wanted and that make it very hard to decide. I dislike early-birds in general because they are unfair and of course lead to a bunch of not necessarily sticking pledges early on but in this case with a board-game where one early-bird tier could be say $250 and another $2500 is really matters. One always want the better price but when we're talking about higher percentages and hundreds of dollars in price difference for a board-game .. Will you be certified "MFI"? As discussed earlier, I would really support some elevated edges on the case for protecting the iPhone screen, because iPhones aren't cheap as we all know. Also protective glasses (real hardened glass and not some plastic film) for the Android screen would be nice as little add-on. Hey dear, I would like to know if the 4G version is unlocked meaning, I can use any other cellular company that use SIM card like (t-mobile, ATT, simple mobile......? In a previous answer you said that the 95$ early bird doesn't have any SIM cards slot. Does it have WiFi at least? How could I install Play Store apps if it doesn't have any connection at all? This wreaks of vaporware. Hello, the pack will be waterproof ? or shock absorbing ? i'm so patient to see your project came true :) I missed the part about 4G vs not. There won't be a way to switch between the early bird offers of each kind? I took the $95 one but maybe the $129 is better, the $95 doesn't have any cellular connectivity at all? The sim cards isn't a thing in it I assume? @Xundong Xin: I assume it will use a pledge-manager after having received the funding to figure out what people actually wanted. As in you'll be able to choose one for iPhone 6, 7 or an upcoming "8" or whatever then. I'm kinda skeptical about how feasible this product is to produce at that price point. At the closer to €200 then sure it become easier. (Also I have no iPhone but whatever.. I'm here to watch and take early-bird offers :D) Anyway, I'm also a vegan and definitely want to stinking leather case. If it was an optional then then that would be better. I don't want it. I don't want it produced. I don't want it mixed with a product of mine. As an add-on accessory sure. As something included then having an option to have something else than a leather one would had been nice. Hello, my model is iphone6s, I bought $ 129, how can I choose models, where to fill in the delivery address, I was in China, is not a good $ 22 freight after it? Hi - What internal RAM does android phone has ? Is Wireless charging already included in the case or is it something extra that you have to purchase for the case? Hi, Does the Early bird edition come with 4G connectivity? Or does it support only the GSM ones? Thanks for the response. Can we have a demo on that? I believe this can be checked by using the camera app. Using the + button should allow you to take photos which means that the volume control and microphone of a 3.5mm jack should be working Sorry for my specific questions, but your answer remains still unclear in some parts to me. Could you specify what you mean by "The user will need to choose between charging only state of one of the devices trough Eye interface." Do you mean by this that you just can select which battery is being charged when power is plugged-in? Is it not possible to charge both batteries automatically? So ADB / debugging mode is not possible? What kind of Wifi speed will come standard with the EYE? Is screen mirroring of the Android screen possible through the lightning port? Hi creator some of my friend that I've shown the working Eye prototype video told me that why in the video there is no actual putting the case on to the iPhone before showing the EYE to function. The video can just be a another phone attach to the iPhone I.e not an actual case. Can you please upload the case with out the iPhone working as it is and then attach to the iPhone and show how the screen can be used as a selfie monitor. Thanks So I can root and put my own custom ROM's onto the device, without worrying that it will have trouble interacting with the iphone? Also, how would the connectivity between the phones work? Could a jailbroken iPhone make this better? Thanks, and good luck! This user's account has been deleted. Definitely would appreciate if you could add USA LTE support. So for the non-4G version will there be some type of Bluetooth or wifi connection? I'm curious about the lightning port of the case. Is it possible to use it as Android Debug Bridge (adb), respectively mass storage device for the internal SD card? Or is it just for charging the battery? In terms of debugging options since the Eye will connect via the lightning port is there any options for USB android debugging? Would the Eye be able to use the lightning cable for debugging/ ADB / Flashing ROMs etc... If this is the case how will you prevent driver conflicts with iTunes and the iPhone? Does the super early bird also have sim card slots as I see other levels of pledge which say 4g connectivity?? So impatient to get this project in hands. I do not like the android version of Samsung but love the top layer developped by Xiaomi. It is for me the best one. Will it be possible to install it instead of the standard android one? Thank you I have a question around MFi as well. Several other products that tried to add a 3.5mm port were not allowed to carry voice inputs over 3.5mm headphones. Will you be restricted by this as well? This is my only main concern as I find it extremely bothersome to be always choosing my voice input device on every call on bluetooth. So Unbox Therapy Has a Prototype and will not release his video.....sounds bad! Can I get a prototype to test �� Hey, where would I got the notification of what phone my casing will be? Something like this.. <url>�� lets kick this into high gear and show us all what we're backing. Which screen protector for the eye smart android screen @Team -> Nice answer :) Seriously, I think your project is absolutely amazing! If the Android display is always on, is the touch screen active while in "standby"? If not, what causes it to wake? Super excited to receive this product! I'm really hoping you can consider making a larger screen size for the 6s+/7+. There's tons more room for a larger screen! the Eye it have slot sim card without 4G ? Come on, guys! So close! Let's make this happen! Also, let's get it up to $500K so we can get that insane battery capacity! So stoked! May I ask that will this case supported for dual SIM card duo standby ?means can we use eye 4g cellular to make cake phone , I'm in! I think this project is amazing but please, give us updates every 3 weeks! I think it's important to keep the trust of the community. I admit I have some doubts about this projet for some reasons. The first, and the biggest, is the $500.000 stretch goal. Dudes, seriously, a 10000mAh battery ?! Go on Google or Amazon and look at the size/weigh of these batteries! It's absolutely not possible to put a 10000mAh battery on this case with these specs... The second is, in your videos of the prototype gallery, I noticed that we never see uses of the Eye and the iPhone at the same time. I mean, we see both screens turned on at the same time, but there are never used together in the same video. Maybe I'm a bit paranoid, but I learnt with many fakes on Kickstarter to be careful about the details of amazing projects. Good luck team! similar question to below: i see on videos that both iphone and second screen are opened. Do we have to wake up iphone screen in order to power android side/screen? I'm not sure if these questions have been asked yet, but the second screen is independent from the iphone screen, is that correct? (Like no screen mirroring or such, just completely different separate) And second, what is the approximate speed of the processor for the 7.1 operating system, and how many cores is there? So with 35 days to go I along with the other backers hope you are getting all the necessary stuff together to make this dream a reality without having snags after the backing stops. Also hope you will gives us timely updates as you progress to different stages of building this case on promised date and not leave backers in the dark like the makers of the Xspander case and SmartKase and offer a refund IF it deems fit. Also I asked and it was said NO there is no lip on front side of case but what it looks like from the GIPHY videos it does look like it has a lip, if it's true and doesn't have one it would be very grateful if it could have one to protect our investment even though we may have a screen protector. And is it possible to put up videos of the person playing with the Android part (moving, deleting, opening apps) along with how the app works on the iOS side. Will the wireless charging actually charge the iPhone or just the secondary screen? Stupid question but does the basic model have wifi? I mean ipod touch and. If you trying to make ipod ver, Even screan is smaller than now . I want to buy ipod touch ver. Don't you have any plan for ipod? Actually i don't have iPhone but i have ipod 6th gen Why don't you trying to make eye for ipod? I just have a suggestion. If the project exceeds its goals (which is quite certain already) would it be possible to make the eye for iPhone compatible with the fingerprint? This would really be something that would certainly attract a lot of people. Since the Iphone does not support wireless charging at this point and the Eye does, does that mean the case has an integrated lightning connection to charge when connected with a wireless charging dock? Are there any hardware differences between the Eye cases for the 5.5" Plus iphones and the 4.7" iphones? like the screen size or battery capacity? Thanks Hi there, will the 4G for France be supported? Thanks :) @Chapman The next iPhone will be supported a month after its launch. An option to wait until Eye for the next iPhone is out will be given to backers. any chance you guys will future prove it by offering a possible iphone 8 (rumor) version of EYE? I currently have a 6S plus but if they really have iPhone 8 this year I will upgrade just wondering if that will be a thing we can choose later on So excited that this campaign is rising so steadily. I haven't been more excited about a potential product purchase since the Nintendo Wii all those years ago. Let's keep this rolling, really want this thing! Hi, what are the bands supported in 4G version? What's the difference between 4G and non-4G? Can't we just put the 4G sim in the second sim slot? Is wireless charging the only way to charge the EYE and phone? Will we have an answer before the campaign is over? I will need to change my pledge to the non-4G version if USA LTE isn't supported. When do we specify what model we need i.e for the iPhone 7 for myself personally or the 6s? Will that effect the date we receive them? <url>��בהצלחה Wish U GREAT SUCCESS �� Moshe Levin how can I get the wireless charger? pledge $20 more? How would you mirror the camera app to take selfie with the main camera lens for portrait mode? So do you mean for the early commitment pledge I just change the amount from $69 to $103 and I will be getting an eye with 4G? If it doesn't get the funding will you continue with the R&D? I am really excited about this project. @creator I must be missing due date. When can we expect product in hand? Very excited to have!! I signed up for ur email and i got one of your early commitment pledge Is there a way to upgrade this pledge to a 4G version? Like add 30 dollars to my pledge for the upgrade? I meant to say can I transfer over my music file from my iPhone to your product? And thanks for the info, i just updated my pledge to 4G Can I use my iPhone number with the eye 4G? Super excited about this product, and everyone needs to throw down for this. I'm selfishly thinking about myself and how much this will help me out. EVERYONE GET IN ON THIS!!! I'm very exited about this product! I'm traveling a lot in a lot of different countries, so the multi SIM card option will be perfect! Which connector do I need to charge the whole phone combination? Apple lightning or micro usb? And when I charge wireless, will it also charge my iPhone? Many thanks! Hope this project will come to life like crazy! The gallery doesn't show up on the Kickstarter app. We can only see this using desktop. I recommended you to post it on the description page instead easy access for us. @creator Share On FB: <url>"eye" & "eye 4G"? Thank you. does the eye without 4g pull data from my iPhone, or does it need a separate sim card to access the internet? If I get the X1 eye case without the 4g, does that mean I can't surf web or anything when it's connected to iPhone? Is it basically its on cell phone? My best wishes for this project greetings from Guatemala I'm so excited for this case!!! Hi! I'm highly excited to see this project come to life! I was wondering how calls would work if it doesn't have one on the actual case. How would one make a call if the earpiece is on the other side of the case? Love the product idea! Two questions: 1. I was an early committed subscriber, and committing to pledge when it came out, and I noticed the pricing for that was $69 and above. Does this mean I will receive the X1 Eye Case, if it is successful? 2. I noticed on the specs that the case has a SIM card slot, with microsim capabilities, so does the X1 Eye Case, from the early committed subscriber pledge, have this SIM or microsim option, or do I need to pledge more for that capability? Why can't I select for 2 of the pre-commitment backers? I would like to get one for my wife as well. Does it have wifi capabilities?? What's the difference between the 4g one and the one without? Just the speed or is there not even an extra simcard slot on the non-4g? Great idea. Tremendous impact. But honestly I think it should be top ten as trying to be one of the first backers is a feat this product is the best I've tried to get cases like this eg. Mesuit and diy but they fail in comparison to this product I cannot wait Top I hope I got too 5
