I want to thank the 800 wonderful backers who believed in my vision and helped making the iPlifier a reality. It started with a simple problem solved by a simple idea and it makes me happy to know it will be used by so many people. In a few days I will finalize all needed to start tooling in order to ship the iPlifier to you on time, before the end of May . I will keep you posted with the highlights of the production process as I found it to be extremely interesting and I am certain that actual pictures from production would be even more interesting. Later skater, Ariel Hello backers, As the end of the campaign is approaching, I am as excited as you are about making the iPlifier a reality. This is a good time to clarify the accountant reward structure as I may have not been clear enough and a few backers have misunderstood it. Thou the reward level is $5, the full amount you should pledge is $8 which will cover cost of the iPlifier as well $3 for shipping and handling. This is true also for North America backers . If you would like to order additional iPlifiers , you need to add only $5 each as S&amp;H is already cover. 1 iPlifier - $8 2 iPlifiers - $13 etc’ For the special Kickstarter Green iPlifier with additional iPlifier in other colors – 1 iPlifier - $15 2 iPlifier (1 green, 1 other color) - $20 etc’ All funds beyond the 7,500 goal will be used to allow for additional colors . With less than 60 hours left to campaign’s end it is a great time to get an additional iPlifiers or ensure you pledge amount of correct. I apologize if I haven’t been clear enough, Ariel We are funded, Amen! Thanks to you, amazing backers, we have finally reached our funding goal with a few more days to go. For the last few days I have been in touch with several suppliers to ensure production goes as smooth as possible and the iPlifier reach you at the time promised . Please keep on spreading the word and maybe consider getting an additional iPlifiers for family and friends. A survey will be sent out a few days after the campaign is complete. It will have a few key questions such as your shipping address and what color you would like your iPlifier to be. Thank you again for being awesome, Ariel Olah backers, As the project campaign comes to a successful end, I have done a trip to several plastic injection mold manufacturers. The tour included some of the leading workshops in Israel. Lead time for fabricating the mold is about 15 business days which will allow the iPlifier™ to be shipped on time, before the end of May. Attached are pictures from a workshop where the injection molds for Rummikub® were made. They had the latest tile mold there which weight 2 tons!!! (that is 4,400 lbs). Once again, I would like to take a moment and ask you to inform family and friends about the iPlifier™. It will allow them to enjoy the cheaper price available through the Kickstarter campaign as well as save them some hand and wrist pain they might have from cupping their hand next the iPhone 5 speaker. ¡gracias! Ariel Shalom my dear backers, We are approaching our goal and it looks very promising. Halleluyah! I wanted to let you know I have added a new pledge level – the ACCOUNTANT REWARD level. The pledge is broken down into the iPlifier cost, $5 and shipping cost $3 which makes bookkeeping so much easier. So… a pledge for a single iPlifier will total $8, no change here. The difference will kick in when you pledge for multiple units. 2 for $13, 3 for $18 etc. This new price also includes additional units for Kickstarter Fan Reward. Take advantage of this! If you have previously pledged for multiple units, you are welcome to decrease your pledge and adjust it to the new reward. However, since we haven’t reach our goal yet, I will urge you to round up your pledge and get a few more iPlifiers to give your family and friends. Cheers, Ariel Hello Awesome Backers, Thank you greatly for your support. We've already passed the 50% milestone of the goal, which means that if we likely to reach it. If you haven't noticed, a few days after the launch we have added a video to the project page. Please take a minute to view it. We need your help to continue spreading the word of how awesome the iPlifier is. Please tell your friends, family, colleagues, and coworkers.
