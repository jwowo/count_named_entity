Today we're launching a dedicated email channel straight to your inbox for product and company updates. Simply called the Avegant Newsletter, expect the first issue of that with another firmware reminder later today. We expect the Avegant Newsletter to become our primary communication channel with you as the summer goes on, updates continue and the Kickstarter campaign starts to sunset. New firmware releases opening up further content channels, for example, are already in the works, while we're working hard to scale up the visibility of the Glyph both in retail and in marketing arenas. It should be a busy summer and we look forward to sharing our progress with you. Follow us on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram for social updates and get a deeper dive into product applications over in the forums . Thank you for all your support along the way. It's great having you as part of our community. Team Avegant Happy summer Glyphletes, With the Kickstarter units now fully deployed, a core focus of our team shifts to improving the technology and opening up new content channels. With firmware release 1.2, out today, we're pleased to report that we've made great progress in both of those areas. Look for version 1.2 of the updater app which contains new firmware in the iTunes and Google Play stores right now. From a content perspective, the following functionalities are now integrated: Plug-and-play 3D with HDMI 1.4 compliant, frame-packed, 720p sources Head tracking will now be enabled on all hardware. Press and hold the bottom left button in video mode with USB plugged in to turn on head tracking. On the 3D content front, good sources for 3D frame-packed content so far are: Playstation 4 automatically detects and plays 3D. Try searching VUDU for 3D movies or playing one of these 3D supported games. Windows 10 and updated Nvidia graphics cards automatically work with the technology, opening up hundreds of games and a multitude of applications to 3D display. On the technology side of the equation, firmware version 1.2 also streamlines and simplifies the Bluetooth stack and prepares the Glyph for further partner development. Full release notes are available on our website . Download and Install the new App and Firmware To install the new firmware, navigate to the Google Play or iTunes stores and update your mobile app to version 1.2. Enable Bluetooth on your Glyph by first turning on your unit, letting it boot and then holding the power button to the ON position for 5-7 seconds. The indicator LED should blink blue. Within the Glyph app, connect to your unit by clicking Connect to your Glyph and tapping the available unit. While you do not need to pair your Glyph to your phone, please make sure your Bluetooth is turned on. In the main Glyph app screen, the update can be pushed by clicking Update available next to the connected unit. If the update is interrupted, try it again. Your update is successful when the Glyph reboots and the Avegant app no longer has the update flag attached. Problems with your update? Navigate over to avegant.com/set-up-support and we'll get you sorted out. In the meantime, keep in touch with us over Facebook , Twitter , Instagram and the Avegant Forums (where there are a variety of lively content discussions ongoing) and keep an eye out for a redesigned newsletter next week. Happy Glyphing, Team Avegant Word from the factory, ladies and gentlemen, is that we're nearing the end of our shipping campaign for Kickstarter units. By the end of next week, 100% of the hardware should be out of the factory, in transit or delivered. It's a huge milestone, and we're all-in on this last push. To that end, if you haven't received an email from Avegant or FedEx with your tracking number by the end of next week, please send us an email at <email> for everything to get sorted out.. As for the Glyph and its development, our efforts are just starting. A new software update enabling some pretty awesome functionality is coming within the next weeks, while new content channels and even more features are headed down the pipeline. With our Kickstarter shipments coming to a close, next month we're also going to transition our product communications to a dedicated newsletter. Keep an eye out -- it'll be full of important product updates and Glyph news. In the meantime, we're going to keep the Kickstarter updates coming until everything is sealed and delivered. Sit tight. The next chapter is about to begin. South by Southwest is officially wrapped and we're now back in the office working on scale, support and documentation while the engineering team continues the shipping push in China. Thanks to all who came out to Austin. We had a massive turnout at our event (over 1000 people signed up!) and great reception. Over in the logistics department, we got an update from the shipping team late last week. As of today, almost all of the engraved units have been shipped. International units are starting this week. We still expect to have everything shipped by mid April. For those that are receiving units, keep those social updates coming. You can tag your Facebook, Twitter and Instagram posts with #gotmyglyph and we'll share them with the Glyph community. As the shipping queue continues to dwindle, we remain focused on building out the consumer experience. Expect a user newsletter and new firmware in the comings weeks. Along the way, we'll keep you updated on shipping, but if you need anything in the meantime, you can always email us at <email>. Team Avegant. Version 1.0 of the Glyph mobile app is officially live! Find the Android version here . Find the iOS version here . Our grand vision for the app includes plans for a content portal, firmware updating capability, Bluetooth connectivity, tutorials and a variety of other features. In short, it'll be your go-to for all-things-Glyph in the mobile setting. Version 1.0 is the early beginning of that effort. Right now, the Glyph app walks users through a detailed setup tutorial and has the functionality to connect to your device over Bluetooth. While full Bluetooth integration hasn't been enabled in this version of the app, later iterations will contain new firmware, allowing you to wirelessly update your hardware. For now, this release places a stake in the ground and allows us to start building. Expect more app updates soon, with improved firmware in tow. Team Avegant Hey everyone, A quick update on international shipping. We're pleased to report that European Certification (CE) cleared last week and that we can commence shipping units internationally. Right now we're in the middle of processing engraved units. At the end of that campaign next week we'll revert to shipping international units in the order of backer number. Thank you for being patient as we conquered the CE monster. Team Avegant Hello everyone! We wanted to give you guys an update on shipping since both European Certification and order priority have been points of discussion out in the community over the last few days. So far, we've shipped about 1000 units. Production in China is still moving at full tilt and yields are improving. The focus of the next three to four weeks is on getting ALL of the Kickstarter units delivered, including engraved units. So far, our biggest challenge has been in securing European Certification (or CE) for deliveries to the EU and the UK. While we originally thought that certification was going to pass in time for initial shipment, complications with some of the hardware we used and then Chinese New Year held up the process -- as you probably guessed, our testing lab shut down in addition to our manufacturing line during the holiday. To our great frustration, that process is still ongoing. Our engineers are working to expedite the process and we should know by Monday whether the certification is moving forward. In the meantime, we're focused on getting as many Glyphs shipped as possible -- and rather than holding off on all international shipments, we're going to start shipping to non-CE-constrained countries. From here on out, that means the order of units shipped will be: The remainder of this week and next week: any remaining US units without engraving Next week and the week after: engraved units start + international units that don't need CE approval As soon as CE certification comes in, we'll start sprinkling those units in too. Thanks for being patient. The process of European Certification has been taxing on everyone on our team and we're as anxious as you are. For those in the EU and UK, we'll let you know as soon as we hear back from our testing lab. Team Avegant Hello Kickstarter Backers, Production continues. Now that the Chinese New Year is over, our manufacturing line is humming along once again, so for those still waiting for tracking numbers, we expect to see more units off the line starting next week. Thanks for being patient. Extra thanks go to our international backers. We're still finalizing CE requirements and are doing everything we can to speed up the process. We are also working on fixing an email issue at the Avegant helpdesk. If you've recently reached out to the support team over our web form, your message may have been delayed in delivery. Please be sure to contact <email> or call (800)270-0760 with any issues you may be facing. We are working to straighten up our servers and hope to have this issue resolved shortly. Looking towards the next few months, we're starting to scale up our community outreach. On March 13th, we are hosting a get together at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas. Kickstarter backers are cordially invited for VIP demos. The event takes place from 2pm to 8pm at Due Forni (106 E. 6th St). You can register here . Please make sure to use the promotional code "AvegantKickstarter" to avoid any long demo lines. See you in Austin and as always, thank you for your continued support. Team Avegant Dear Kickstarter Backers, We’re thrilled to be shipping the Glyph this week. Over 200 tracking numbers have already been sent out and more units are shipping through the week. If you have already received your tracking number, you can expect to get your Glyph early next week. For those still waiting, we are doing regular updates and you should be getting it soon. A few notes on the initial shipping process: Everyone from the engineers to the operators is working seven days a week bringing the line up to a solid hum. Yields are improving daily, but as this is new technology, the process is still measured. It'll take some time before the line is at a full run rate. Our manufacturing partner will be on break during the Chinese New Year holiday, February 6 through February 16th. Glyph CE certification came through later than we expected and should be finalized the week after Chinese New Year. Our international shipments are delayed until that comes in. Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do to speed it up. On February 16th we'll also start integrating engraved units into the line. We’re expecting all Kickstarter units to be shipped by the end of March. A few notes on the unboxing: Since we printed our Quick Start Guide we've been through several firmware updates that refine the button and LED interaction. We'll send out a new, digital QSG in the coming days. We're also working on a simple plug-and-play guide that will go in later boxes. We'll send out a digital version of that in a few days too. The Glyph App is nearing completion. You'll be able to use that in either iOS or Android environments for onboarding and firmware updates via Bluetooth. Look for a link to that app to be coming your way soon. Per FCC constraints, we're also shipping the Glyph with head-tracking OFF. We'll share instructions for those who want to enable head-tracking functionality prior to the app availability. As the process unfolds and Glyphs enter the market, we're really looking forward to your feedback on how your initial experience goes and what you would like us to improve going forward. You can send your feedback to <email>, or if you have technical support issues you can now call us at 1.800.270.0760. We would also love for you to share your unboxing experience with the Glyph community. Take some photos and videos and post them to the Avegant forums or on social media ( Facebook , Twitter , Instagram ) using the hashtag #GotMyGlyph and we'll send the best submissions some Avegant swag. That's it for now. Keep checking for tracking numbers. Thank you for your continued support and excitement around this breakthrough device. Team Avegant Great news everyone, shipping is currently underway! First units have already started rolling off the line and we should have them in the mail late this week. Our goal is to have several hundred units out the door before Chinese New Year. First priority: early Kickstarter Backers. Once the line is up and humming we'll start shipping out the engraved units as well. Our plan is to interlace tracking numbers into our master Kickstarter database and email you individually when your units ship. At that time, we'll also include the latest information on unboxing, quick start and mobile app installation. Now's also a good time to make sure you have the right video adapters on hand. The Glyph comes with a micro HDMI to standard HDMI cable, so if you need to plug in your phone or tablet, an adapter will be necessary. For iPhones and iPods, that's the Lightning Digital adapter (here on the Apple store) . Android hardware will vary, but an MHL or SlimPort adapter usually does the trick. Check with your phone or tablet manufacturer for more information on video-out. The Glyph compatibility list is also on our website . Keep an eye on your inbox for news about tracking numbers. Fulfilling our entire Kickstarter database will take some time -- so please be patient -- but the first units are leaving soon! <url>’m sure many of you know, building breakthrough products is never an easy and straightforward process -- your patience and understanding throughout this year means a great deal to me. We’re doing things that have never been done before and I'm confident that the wait will be worth it. Finally, from all of us here at Avegant, have a safe and wonderful holiday season and best wishes for the new year. All of my best, Joerg Tewes, CEO Avegant Happy holiday season Kickstarter Backers: It's time to start collecting addresses for shipping! You should receive a survey in your inbox at some point today. Please fill it in as soon as possible and send it back to us -- we need to start planning for delivery. When is your Glyph going to reach your doorstep? Between now and the trucks leaving the factory we have a few milestones to reach. Of those, the two biggest are related to compliance and mass production line startup. On the compliance side, we're currently working with US and international vendors to lock in US, Canadian, European and Chinese certifications. That's on schedule, but will remain a risk until every single compliance is buttoned up. From a mass production perspective, we've got solid confidence in the integrity and repeatability of our manufacturing line, and we're spending the next two weeks working out any remaining kinks. Provided all of our suppliers stay on track we shouldn't have any line disruptions. We don't expect any for now, but there's always a risk. During the week of December 14th, we're going to have an all-hands meeting at the factory to verify that the line is in good shape and that we can manufacture at scale. If everything checks out at that point, we can flip the switch and start cranking out units. From that point, it'll take us about a week to get from initial assembly to final packout. Once shipping starts, units will leave the factory via express freight (expect 6-10 days in transit) and ship worldwide. Units will ship duty free and Avegant will prepay the VAT. We expect to be able to manufacture about 500 units each week. Orders will go out as a function of backer numbers -- the lower your backer number, the sooner your ship date. Engraved units may also experience a week or two lag. Between line startup and any shipping logistics, we obviously face a scenario in which Glyphs don't start getting boxed until the last week of December and don't leave the factory until right after the new year. We're going to be doing our best to shorten that timeline as much as possible but conservatively, it's the best estimate we have. Hopefully we can beat that. Either way, we should have a more concise timeline during the week of the 14th. In the meantime, please fill out your survey as soon as possible so we can populate our shipping partner. Thanks for your patience. We're almost there! Team Avegant Hi everybody, it's Grant, your project manager for the engraving effort. I've been working with a laser engraver over the past few days to set up a printing template and test various designs, and I'm pleased to report that we're almost ready to start production. Right now, it looks like the best and most aesthetic placement for the laser engraving will be on the mute button on the right side of the Glyph. I've also been coordinating with the main production line in China to make sure that we can integrate and track these etched pieces into our core process. Word from the production line is that once mass production starts they need a few weeks to get the process up and firing on all cylinders before introducing any disruptions. So if anyone wants custom engraving, it may slow down your delivery by 3-4 weeks. I'll do my best to shorten that, but I also have to respectfully give them time to set up a proper manufacturing line. Onto the artwork: we'd like to give those who opt in the ability to select from a couple of different options. Your backer number Something of your choice Your (or someone's) name The engraving will look something like this: Or in real life, something like this: The font for standard engraving be Agenda-Medium. Since all of you got special edition units, I'll additionally open up the Adobe Illustrator template to you for you to submit a design of your choice, bearing in mind: The manufacturing line can't guarantee any symmetrical placement (besides, the Glyph rotates 90 degrees between audio and video modes). I'll do my best to engrave whatever you give me, but if you try to put the Magna Carta on a 0.65" diameter disc it's going to fail. There's only so much resolution that the system can support. Creating these designs may be an iterative process and can directly impact your ship date if I have to put extra cycles in. Please work with the below templates to ensure a speedy design and delivery. Given the potential delay, we're giving you the option to opt into this. If you'd like engraving, please visit and fill in this form by Friday, November 20th at Midnight Pacific. If you do nothing, we'll assume you don't want engraving. A bitmap template is here . An Adobe Illustrator template (preferred) is here . We're using a Universal 60W laser , if you're interested. Questions? Let me know in this thread and I'll personally update you all -- look for the Grant Martin commenter below. Happy engraving! Grant Hi everybody, Things are coming along nicely on the engineering and operations teams and we are getting ready to begin mass production. But first, we wanted to take some time to talk about some of the product features, the work that went into them and what's still left to come. We're calling this version of the Glyph the Founder's Edition. It'll be fully supported, warrantied and regularly updated with firmware updates via Bluetooth. It is unique. As Kickstarter backers, you will be some of the few to own this device, and you will be a core member of our founding community. It is because of your support that we are able to carry this company and project onward and we are eternally grateful. On your Founder’s Edition Glyph, each of you will have the ability to engrave something personal – your name; a symbol. We are super excited about it and we hope you are too. In the next couple of weeks, we will share engraving options and instructions. Now, onto the product. Here are the final specifications for Glyph Founder’s Edition: Resolution: 1280x720p per eye; two million micromirrors in total Aspect ratio: 16:9 Dimensions: Width – 7.5 inches (190.5mm), Height – 4 inches (101.6mm), Depth – 7.5 inches (190.5mm) · Weight: 14.5oz (411g) Field of view: ~40 degrees; equivalent to a sitting in the "sweet spot" at 71 ft back in a typical 52 ft movie theater Video and audio input: microHDMI Frequency response: 20Hz-20kHz Dynamic Range: 95dB Audio-Only Input: 3.5mm TRRS Battery Life Video: up to 4 hours Charging Port: microUSB Battery: Li-lon, integrated Battery Capacity: 2060mAH 9 axis IMU for headtracking Firmware updates for enhanced features and capabilities Many of you voiced your concern about a lack of ANC and we heard you loud and clear. But the reality of a Kickstarter campaign like this is that we underestimated what goes into a product of this magnitude and we had to make a decision. In the end, we decided to ship product. The good news is that that the current noise isolation and sound quality is really outstanding, due in large part to the over-ear design and the clamp pressure (requisite, as you know, for video mode). Bragging about audio quality is easy to do as founders of the project, of course, but once you receive your Glyphs, we're confident that you will agree. Some of you also asked about 3D support. Right now, our firmware supports all side-by-side 3D content. On the delivered Glyph, there will be options to switch from 2D mode to 3D mode. We are continually working to support all 3D form factors, and hopefully will be able to deliver these changes to you via firmware updates. Make no mistake: every single component of this device from the optics to the ear can material to the companion app to the full spectrum of user touch points has been meticulously engineered, evaluated and then reengineered, driving to the goal of delivering a truly high quality device. Many of the features over deliver and some you may not agree with. But at the end of the day, you are getting the world's first personal premium mobile display built inside the headband of a pair of headphones - a unique and category-defining Kickstarter Reward. We hope that you'll share the beauty of this innovation and the work that went into it with us. We can’t wait to share it with all of you. Team Avegant Hey Glyphletes, Happy Friday! With our main prototyping runs successfully behind us, the time has come for us to sign off on final features for the deliverable Glyph. That means taking a strong look at our Kickstarter commitments and weighing them against the imperative of shipping. We've accomplished an extraordinary amount of product design and development since the birth of Glyph last year. We've designed a category-defining product in-house, spun up a contract manufacturer in China, assembled a spectrum of international and domestic suppliers and packed as much as we could into the device that we're delivering later this year. That includes: Top notch design and assembly. No creaky joints, no sloppy paint jobs and robust components all around. Glyph looks and feels like a final product. Solid battery life. Our early tests show that Glyph can run on battery for 4-5 hours, which is almost double our initial estimates. A companion app. Onboarding and product walkthrough will all be through a companion app that's currently under development. Upgradeable firmware. You'll be able to easily and quickly upgrade your Glyph as we push out new versions of the firmware. Lighter than we expected. Current Glyphs weigh about 420g vs our initial 450g projections. Bluetooth. Though Bluetooth Audio may not be complete by shipping, we're aggressively pushing to make Bluetooth headracking work. Bright, clear and vivid optics. We went through SEVEN prototype cycles with our optical suppliers and we're very happy with the corner-to-corner clarity and the quality of our optics. USB headtracking. Works great! Swappable, magnetic nosebridges. Based on hundreds of hours of research. 3D and 360 content support. 3D support works marvelously with side-by-side content. 360 imaging will work with head tracking. Several features were too complicated or time consuming to fit into the final build. Bulk alternative color options. We dramatically underestimated the difficulty in iterating multiple colors out of one core design. While more colors are charted for the future, the first batch of Glyphs can only come in black. Similarly, we had to order cables in batches of 10,000s, so we can't produce custom cables. Noise cancelling. While the over-head headphones provide excellent sound isolation, adding a noise canceling circuit to Glyph proved to be too expensive. This process in building Glyph has been an exercise in compromise, patience and humbleness for the entire founding team. We've put our hearts and our health into making the best Glyph that we can deliver to you guys, and we're confident that we're delivering a product that's both well-built and useful for a wide spectrum of applications. To that end, here's what you can expect in the box: A Special Edition or standard Founder's Edition Glyph: Though we won't be able to include colors, we do have something very special in mind for the first 500 Special Edition backers. We're working with the manufacturer on it right now. HDMI and USB Cables: The HDMI cable will be a custom, Avegant-only micro-HDMI connection. Four nose pieces: Like in-ear headphones come with three earbuds, Glyph will come with four different nosepieces to accommodate a wide spectrum of head types. A case: A soft fabric case for easy Glyph storage. A headstrap: An optional headstrap for long term use. A lens cover: Hair products and grease will not affect wearing Glyph in audio-mode. A quick start guide. The light is finally at the end of the tunnel. The Glyph is in its final final design stages and we're looking forward to finally firing up the mass production line and cranking out some hardware. Coming up, we'll have updates on precise shipping targets. Thanks for everything so far. We are very excited! Team Avegant Good afternoon Kickstarter Backers: Our beta testing program is kicking into gear this week. The plan is to run a brief campaign with the current prototype units over the course of this month and then pack any feedback into the final builds as we prepare for mass production in early December. In light of the tight timeframe, we're working with a professional beta testing operation down in Los Angeles to recruit, execute and compile data from the study. We've asked them to include you Kickstarter backers within their recruiting window. Before you fire up your clicking fingers, remember that beta testing is a far bigger commitment than simply taking an early look at the technology. For this campaign, we'll loan you an early prototype of the Glyph for some intensive long term testing, and you'll need to rigorously document and report on your findings. It'll be a great way to help shape the future of Avegant and the Glyph, but it also will not be a walk in the park. If you're interested in participating, please complete a short qualification survey here by Sunday, October 4th at 11:59PM PST. We'll forward that data onto the beta testing contractors and they'll take care of recruiting. To note, the beta test isn't going to cover an enormous population, but we've made sure that at least a handful of Kickstarter backers will be included in the program. We're excited to get your detailed feedback, and for those interested, we look forward to trying out the tech. For the rest of you, sit tight for delivery. Team Avegant More good news Glyphletes: We've wrapped up our most recent manufacturing run in China and just got the full shipment of prototype hardware back in the offices in California. In short: the Glyphs look AMAZING. Optics are crisp and bright, construction is solid and we're on steady ground to move this operation into mass production. We couldn't be happier. Based on the success of this prototype run we have strong confidence that we can start shipping in the beginning of December. There are a handful of logistical issues to sort out between now and then, but as of now, there are few barriers in the way between today and delivery. We'll have more news in the coming weeks on exact timing for each round of Kickstarter backers. In the meantime, check out some pictures of the new units, their arrival and the unboxing process. For those of you coming to our Kickstarter days in NYC and San Francisco , these are the units that we'll be sharing with you. They're also pretty close to the units that we'll be shipping for mass production. In the coming weeks we'll provide an update on all of the features that we’re delivering in the final build. Between now and then, it's all about fine-tuning and logistics as our production line heats up and we get ready to ship. Expect a hardware update, Kickstarter Day debriefs and requests for your shipping data within the next month or so. Get excited! Team Avegant PS- We are live on Instagram. You should follow us. @avegant Hello Glyphletes: We're happy to announce that we will be hosting two events just for our Kickstarter backers in October. Join us in San Francisco or New York to meet with Avegant's founders, share some tasty food and drinks, and best of all, demo the latest Glyph devices! We'd like to meet you, say thank you for supporting our vision to produce this killer product, and get feedback about your experience. Please make sure to RSVP ahead of time with the following Eventbrite links: New York: Oct 6, 2015 San Francisco: Oct 13, 2015 Hope to see you there! Team Avegant Glyphletes, we have a milestone to celebrate. We announced today that Avegant has closed a $24M Series B round of funding, led by investor Lian Luo (Hangzhou Liaison Interactive Information Technology Co., Ltd), a market leader in China. We're also really happy to have previous investors Intel Capital and NHN in this round. You can read the official press release here or an update from the WSJ here . The team is very excited about what we can accomplish in the next couple of months and we can't wait to share it with all of you. As always, thanks for your support. Team Avegant Good news Glyphletes, we're almost done with another round of prototype manufacturing! The first portion of our campaign focused on the assembly and testing of our optical housing, by far the most complex mechanical segment of the Glyph. As you can imagine, we've spent a lot of time in the clean room. With fully assembled prototypes now in sight, we plan to set up a few Kickstarter Days in New York and San Francisco this September for backers and friends of the company to come out and see the new gear. It'll be a good opportunity to meet the team, check up on our progress and have a few beers. More on that soon, as well as some nice news coming up on the Beta Testing. In the meantime, we're focused on making sure that this round of prototypes comes together cleanly and that it positions us properly for the rest of manufacturing -- namely your Kickstarter units. We've much to learn from this manufacturing round, but regardless of the outcome we'll be able to put together a more concise schedule projecting rough delivery dates and other milestones before moving into mass production. Thanks as always for your patience. The Glyph is moving forward, logistics are coming together and we're really excited about the next few months. Team Avegant We're in the process of assembling and testing our prototype units in China this week, which is a laborious and exhausting process. Setting up test fixtures and plodding through all of the QC on each component can feel like running in place, but it's a critical step towards building out high quality and high volume assemblies -- so we're barreling through it. Perhaps the only silver lining among the long days in the lab is the occasional Easter egg sent down from the line from the EE team. Below: left (Lionel) and right (Robot) button boards ready for depaneling and integration. Rumor has it that we're going to need updated "R" and "L" imagery for our next generation boards, so if you've got any ideas in the fridge, throw them out and we'll cook them. Happy Fourth of July Glyphletes. Good news too: our next manufacturing run is firing up and we should have new prototypes in our hands by the end of next month. This new round of prototypes coming off the line integrates all of our latest and greatest improvements, including a markedly better fit, improved optics and better overall adjustments -- all translating to a cleaner and longer viewing experience for all Glyph users. Over the next month, squads of our engineering team will be cycling through the factory to make sure that the manufacturing line properly ramps up, that production goes smoothly and that QC is in line. It's going to be a long few weeks. But if everything goes well, we should still be on schedule for an autumn delivery. Based on the output volume of this production run we should also have enough units for early stage developer and beta testing. While we expect each campaign to be modest in size, our hope is that we can get some early insight into what our users love about the Glyph, what needs work and how the ultimate product is going to be used. We'll share details of the beta and developer programs as they come together this month. For now, enjoy your holiday. Team Avegant In parallel with our hardware development, tooling setup and user testing this summer, the software team has been hard at work in building out our firmware. One of their priorities is head tracking. A critical component to any immersive or interactive experience, head tracking allows a user to engage with a variety of media including active (from outlets like Jaunt or Immersive ) and passive 360° content (say, from a Ricoh Theta camera). What we're most excited about though, is live 360° content, or media that can be actively streamed. Last week, DJI invited us out to Shenzhen to try out active head tracking with their drone technology. In a quick spot with CNN , our initial tests worked swimmingly. As we head towards this fall, our plan is to lock in our head tracking standards and start working with content partners to natively mesh with the world of immersive content. There are a ton of potential partners and we're excited to continue building. Team Avegant Happy Friday Glyphletes: We write as we wrap up a trip down to Los Angeles, where early stage fit testing on the current Glyph prototypes just kicked off. As a result of these tests, the Glyph will evolve throughout the summer as we continue to iterate on design and successfully hit milestones towards our fall delivery. Along the way, mechanical, optical and electrical systems will be refined as we test each corner of the technology and compile user feedback. This week's fit testing is a first gut check on how our initial development is being received. We're working with a small user testing facility in LA to recruit an unbiased group of testers, and each person is giving us their feedback on the current fit and function as we expose them to a variety of media streams. We expect to get early results from the testing facility next week. Regardless of the outcome, these initial tests are just the tip of the iceberg above a much broader batch of user studies coming down the pipeline -- all geared towards ensuring that the deliverable Glyph is both comfortable for long term use and functional as a personal, premium media device. Later this summer, we've got a larger scale beta test with newer prototypes planned. We'll have more details on that (including how you may be able to participate) as the study comes together. In the meantime, we're focused on extracting meaningful results from our initial user testing. Thanks as always for your patience. So far, everything remains on schedule for delivery in the fall. When the manufacturing line fires up with our final design updates, we should have an exact delivery date for you. Team Avegant Over the course of this spring and summer, we're working on two ergonomic studies to perfect the Glyph's fit over a wide spectrum of users. The first, which we kicked off late last month, is focused on building a comfortable and low-profile nose bridge. Critical in this stage is the dynamic between the clamping pressure from the headphones and the downward load on the user's nose. We want to be very careful to balance those two forces so that long term comfort is maximized. Tuning the nose pressure is also complicated by the wide array of facial structures present throughout the world's population ( The Measure of Man and Woman: Human Factors in Design by Alvin Tilley and Henry Dreyfuss Associates provides great further reading if you're interested). In addition to there being great variance between a nuclear family's head measurements (including ranges of interpupillary distance, head length, eye orbit to ear hole length, etc), there's also great variance between American populations and those from China, Russia, Sri Lanka and any of the other 100 countries to which we're delivering Glyphs. Solving all of those fits with one design is our great task. The first step that we need to take though, is in designing the nose bridge architecture. Based on our measurements so far, the best approach seems to be to deliver multiple nose bridge designs with each Glyph order, similar to how in-ear headphone manufacturers deliver multiple earbud covers . Designing iterations of those, including material, construct and integration is currently underway, bearing in mind that we want the nosebridge to be either collapsible or removable in audio mode. Below are the early concepts that we used for our initial phase of in-house testing. Based on data collected from our current study and overall design constraints, we're now crafting a series of integrated nosebridges for the Engineering Validation Test build this spring. With those units, we'll perform our second round of ergonomic testing in a wider and more critical study that perfects the overall fit for users from Azerbaijan to Zimbabwe. Once our final nose bridge design comes together for this next build, we'll show you the prototypes. Team Avegant It's been a marathon two weeks between Mobile World Congress in Spain and South by Southwest in Austin Texas, but the dust is finally starting to settle. Thanks to all of you that came out to see the Glyph and team Avegant on the road. In Austin, our demos went swimmingly. We were able to take over a small restaurant on 6th street to build out a private demo and hospitality space where backers and partners could grab a drink and snack, interact with the team and filter through four demo stations illustrating a variety of use cases. We even had a photobooth. In addition to giving backers and partners a progress update and a chance to try out the technology first-hand, we were able to capture some extremely important feedback on the Kickstarter campaign and the Glyph user experience. At large, the current response on the ergonomics of these prototypes has been positive. By the time we launch, we plan on the responses being an order of magnitude better. As winter winds to a close we're now back in the office boring down on user testing and refining our current CNC prototypes. In a few weeks we head back to China to start ramping up our Engineering Validation Testing cycle. Expect a few quick updates on the rest of the CNC manufacturing effort between now and then. Team Avegant The Glyph lives! Great news everyone. Our first prototype build went off without any major hiccups and our new Glyph demo units are up and running. We've now got a handful of prototypes in the Redwood City offices and are working on streamlining the current hardware and the future manufacturing process. From here on out you'll be seeing more Glyph demos out in the wild. At the outset, media and public demos won't be the final "deliverable" Glyphs, but as the summer plods along and we continue to update hardware, each version will see marked improvement. Only when all of the hardware is up to spec will we actually release review units. We'll be taking the first Glyphs from this most recent build with us out to Mobile World Congress in Barcelona next week for some hands-on profiles of the technology. Expect some early hardware updates from that effort. After that, we'll continue to share some more insight into the build process. Team Avegant Good news from the factory: line setup is complete and went off without a hitch. This early stage of manufacturing serves to set up our global foundation of assembly and testing. Each station of the prototype build is stocked with components from all of our distributors, tolerances are measured and QC is performed on each individual part. With over 180 unique parts going into the full build, this is no small task. The good news, however, is that all of our checks and balances have come through positively. Assembly and optical testing are already underway as we work carefully around the Lunar New Year. Our earliest prototypes should be wrapped up shortly. Gung Hei Fat Choy! The Glyph prototype build is officially underway! These prototypes are phase I in our iterative effort to build and refine the technology as we move towards a final product later this year. We expect there to be many complications within the build process, which is exactly what we want. The lessons that we learn from this effort will be processed by the engineering team through March and integrated into the next build -- and as we continue to iterate, the prototypes will get better and better. With that said, we have high expectation for some awesome, workable prototypes out of this first build. Depending on how robust they are, we hope to share some of them with the community, the media and the public at South by Southwest on March 15 and 16. Here's how the build is going to go: Engineers are currently in the process of line setup in our factory and are verifying parts from the suppliers. They're also working on assembly operations. There's a fair amount of optical QC that we have to perform to make sure that the first round of optics are functional. While we don't expect them to be perfect in the first spin, they need to be close enough to produce our signature, super clear image. We expect the first Glyph off the line a bit later this month and to have our early prototypes back in the office in Redwood City in early March for testing and fine tuning. Throughout the course of this effort we'll be zooming in on various aspects of the process to give you updates on specific hardware components. A great deal of innovation boiled up to the surface over the past few months as we worked on ergonomic and aesthetic issues and we are excited to share all of that with you. It should be clear, too, that these prototypes are functionally nowhere near what the deliverable product will ultimately reflect. There are still great improvements coming between now and then, including ergonomic, design and mechanical updates. But the product of this first build will be much, much closer to the final devices that you receive. They'll be wearable, testable and shareable. Starting now, the fun begins. Team Avegant Two weeks after the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas wrapped up, we've finally sorted through the mountain of meeting notes, business cards, photos, flyers and receipts. It was a fantastic event. While our engineers continued work on the Glyph in China and Redwood City, a few core members of our management team took the quick trip to Las Vegas to show off the product and meet with the community. Over the course of the week we were able to meet with a great group of consumers, media and potential partners. Most of the meetings took place in our booth: We had an awesome display built to showcase the Glyph: There were several live media spots, including a brief stint on CES Live . Some of our Kickstarter backers even stopped by. Looking back, CES was a great opportunity for Avegant to carefully scale up our presence in a frugal and yet highly visible way. As we pack our bags for China this weekend we're still fielding calls and forging relationships to help shape the future of the Glyph technology. Keep an eye out for a South by Southwest update if you want to be among the first to try out the new prototypes coming off the line next month. We'll be posting updates throughout the course of the build. Team Avegant Hey everyone, Thanks for your positive support after our design release last Monday . After a good week at CES and some time getting everything back in order in the office we wanted to take a few minutes to collect all of the questions about the new design and answer them one by one. How does the deliverable Glyph differ from the Alpha that we saw on Kickstarter? The new design has a more durable and sustainable ergonomic fit, better-engineered optics and more thoroughly tested electrical and mechanical systems. Interpupillary and focal adjustments have also been improved. With the new design, what customizations will I receive that other people (i.e. pre-orders, retail customers) will not? Kickstarter backers will receive a more customized version of the Glyph than everyone else, before everyone else. While a custom LED ring is not going to be possible with the new design, we're going to try to keep all of the other customizations in place. As our design goes through validation this winter we'll update you on what fits into the initial packaging. What are the sizing specs of the new design? As currently planned, the device is about the size of a pair of large, noise-cancelling headphones (i.e. Beats, Bose, etc). It will weigh about 15oz (430g). For sizing perspective, the center diameter of the ear can measures 6cm and the outer measures 10cm. Will there be a head strap? Since several of you asked about a head strap for long term use we're looking into its integration. We should know more after our ergonomic studies are wrapped up. Can you update my mailing address for me? Prior to shipment we will be sending out a survey for everyone to fill our their most updated information. If your address changes between now and the fall don't worry -- we'll collect your address down the road. When exactly is the delivery date again? In the fall of this year. If you missed our previous message , we announced an updated delivery schedule at the end of last year. How can I try out the Glyph? Our next public demos will be at South by Southwest in Austin in March. We'll release details about this event in the coming weeks. There will also be other public demos through the year. What is this Jellyfish I heard about and how can I get one? The Jellyfish is a proof of concept prototype that we built to demonstrate some future technology on our roadmap. We're currently exploring the technology with a few key partners and we're not actively bringing it to the consumer market. There's still much to do in the design process and as we wade through suppliers and assembly we're sure that more small tweaks will come down the pipeline. For now, it's back to packaging and preparation for our first prototype run. Back to work, Team Avegant Hey everyone, We're in the process of aggregating all of the inbound questions from the design release and CES , but in the meantime we wanted to give a quick update on pricing. On January 15th at 11:59PM ET, the preorder and final retail price of the Glyph will go up to $599 -- a 20% increase from the $499 that most of you paid. If you know anyone who's interested in preordering at the $499 price point, now's the time to share the news. Preorders made through Avegant.com (or shoplocket.com , our preorder manager) will be delivered after the Kickstarter units and before final retail distribution. They also wont get any of the customizations that the Kickstarter backers ordered. Anyone interested in preorders at the $499 price can sign up at avegant.com/pre-order . We'll be back with answers to the design update later this week. Team Avegant Glyph Backers: We’re very excited share our final product design with you this evening. The official announcement goes live tomorrow at noon. Over this course of this week at CES we’ll be giving the media the opportunity to look at the new design first-hand and to try out our complete spectrum of hardware demos. These design prototypes are wearable and represent the polished look that you’ll receive later this year, though they do not include functioning optics. Through the course of this and next month (our full, updated timeline is in this post ), we’ll be packing the electronics and design together to bring forth fully operational and representative prototypes, which will have all of the features, specifications and capabilities of the earlier Kickstarter product. As we enter our validation and testing phase later this quarter we’ll be providing updates on specific facets of the technology. This week, we will be focusing on sharing the designs with the media and running operations at CES. There should be plenty of updates from the media, so keep your eyes peeled. In the meantime, we'll be back with more product and design updates soon. Thank you for all of your support and patience. Team Avegant We've had a very busy few months flying back and forth between San Francisco and China working with our manufacturing partner to set up our supply chain. For a project like this, that's no small task. Our suppliers span the globe from New England all the way through several provinces in China and each of them needs to be thoroughly vetted and engaged. In some cases, it's a simple as a conference call, but most of the time we need to be on the ground, in the factory and physically inspecting people and machinery. It's an exhausting and time consuming process. Thankfully, we're almost done. One highlight: the lugworm. You've probably seen plenty of scorpion and cricket-on-a-stick photos from central China, but the lugworm caught us by surprise. As for the taste? Our VP of engineering describes it as "ocean flavored jello." Our first builds begin in January in just a couple of weeks. Until then, we're sticking with hotel food. Hey everyone, We’ve got some more details on the delivery schedule for your Glyphs. First though: an apology for the delay in getting these full details to you. Though our CTO foreshadowed our delivery timeline in an initial delay message , we’ve been cautious in releasing an exact schedule because of the unknowns that were sitting in our production queue. Ergonomic studies. Soft tooling. FCC and UL testing. We had to pull data together from all of these sources to build out a final robust timeline. Doing so accurately took a bit of time. For that, we're sorry. Additionally, we also wanted to make sure that our updated schedule had a high probability of success – though you guys have been wonderful and supportive of our early delays, nobody wants to see repeated or continuous schedule changes. With that said, onto our updated production timeline. Everything is signed and sealed with our manufacturing partners in China. Half a dozen engineers are currently there working on tooling infrastructure and fitting our design to the manufacturer’s capabilities. Our plan is vet that process (what we call engineering validation) through the holidays into next year and in parallel, prepare for our design launch at CES . Prototypes from the engineering validation efforts should roll off the line in February. We’ll be doing a wide range of testing starting then and through delivery. In early March, we plan on showing those prototypes to the public at both Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and SXSW in Austin, Texas. Around that time we should also be launching our beta test program and for that campaign we plan on pulling in resources from industrial as well as community groups. While that’s still being mapped out, we expect to release details at the beginning of Q2. And to be clear, these won’t be the beta devices you backed on Kickstarter – they will be early hardware prototypes built solely for product testing and feedback. As we earlier mentioned, we’ll be delivering consumer versions of the Glyph to all of our Kickstarter backers. Those Kickstarter deliveries are still our number one priority. Past our hardware testing phase next summer, the first headsets off the line will go to our Kickstarter backers. Our conservative estimates forecast those deliveries to be in the fall. We’re also looking at ways to abbreviate the production timeline specifically for Kickstarter backers, potentially delivering the Glyph even further before the consumer devices come off the line. Once we can figure out what sort of options to build into the delivery process we’ll let you know. In short, you should be seeing a lot more hardware updates in the coming months as our manufacturers fire up their engines and we put the finishing touches on the design. There’s also much more to be excited about. CES is a month away and we’re looking forward to sharing the technology and its future with the community. Not long after that we’re going to be testing new prototypes and applying them to new frontiers in computing, gaming and media streaming. And we’ve got a few awesome partnerships coming down the line that we’re really excited to share with you. Thanks to all of you for being patient with the process and for understanding the complexity of delivering an enormous hardware project. We know that Kickstarter is about community funding, building a product together and supporting new technologies -- but we also know that we have products to deliver and promises to keep. We’ll do our best to stay on the above schedule and we’ll keep the community flush with updates along the way. All of our best, Team Avegant Those of you who read the funding press release probably noticed that we'll be revealing the deliverable Glyph's final design at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas early next year. We thought long and hard about how to approach CES and now, fully committed to a visit, we wanted to share with you our ultimate strategy. Right now we have a booth booked on the show floor at the Sands Expo Center in Tech West. There, we'll be showing off the design of the final product as well as the family of technologies that evolved into the deliverable Glyph. We wont be doing live demos on the show floor -- it's far too noisy and distracting -- but we'll have some space set aside for private business meetings. Our plan right now is for CES to be the launch of our design prototypes. At a later, larger event in the early part of the year, we plan to do a bigger launch with live deliverable demos and a wider footprint. Once that's in the books we'll let you know exactly when and where that will be. Should any of you find yourself in Las Vegas we'd love to see you. Joerg, Ed, Allan and a few other key players will be running around the floor and will be willing to answer questions and shed any light on our developmental pathway. As usual, it should be a fun and exhausting event. CES also plays into a larger launch and delivery strategy that we hinted at in our last update. With most of the pieces now in place, we should be ready to share our upcoming milestones in our next Kickstarter update. In the meantime, we look forward to seeing you on the road. Team Avegant Late one evening in the Canary.is offices of New York City we were comparing notes on crowdfunding campaigns among a few hardware founders and the Canary guys asked how much we had raised. "$1.5M," we told them. They grew serious, briefly, and put down their beers. "You're going to need a lot more than that." They were right. Building a hardware company from absolute scratch through design, testing, manufacturing and distribution is a labor and cost-intensive process. Sure, it's possible to put every cent towards design, tooling and shipping, but supporters of Avegant and the Glyph deserve more than that. They deserve a well-thought-out product and the opportunity to see their support bear fruit into a sustainable, respectable company. We'd like that too. While manufacturing and delivering the Glyph is our number one priority, we also want the opportunity to bring you later generations of the technology and flex our muscles in other product categories. And that takes investment. We've been carefully talking to Intel Capital for the last few months about the prospect of a round of venture funding, one that will lock in our manufacturing contracts and secure the near-term future of the company. As of this week, we're pleased to announce that investment round is final. In addition to Intel Capital, several other groups participated in the extended series A round including NHN Investment, Kaiwu Capital, and yes, Snoop Dogg. The full round raised just short of $9.5M and you can see a full release from Avegant and Intel respectively here and here . As to the nature of this investment and how it will affect operations at Avegant, we expect nothing to change. All of our VC partners support our trajectory and we're not getting pulled into a billion dollar black hole. There was no Champagne -- we're still working around the clock, eating take out sushi and fretting about the future. With this funding in this place, we now simply have the assurance that we can do a good job and deliver a product that we can all be proud of. If you read the above press release, you also may have noticed that we've committed to revealing our final design at CES early next year. We're still in the process of formalizing our approach to that conference, but when we have a solid idea of our presence we'll share that with you. As well, we expect an update on the manufacturing and delivery milestones within the next few weeks. Back to work for us. Team Avegant We've been working on testing the ergonomic fit of the deliverable Glyph with the developmental prototype and its cousin, the ergomule, over the last few days with the goal of learning more about how the device fits the spectrum of head types out there. A Chinese gymnast, for example, might have a completely different head type from a Danish football player, but they both may want to wear the same device. Our lead industrial designer, Bernie, has been putting the office through the wringer for some of the early testing. After fit parameters are set, each user is assigned to wear the ergomule for an extended period of time and then rank the fit by a range of factors. Given the variety of characters and head types in the office, you can imagine how colorful that dataset is. Past our in-house testing, Bernie's also consulting an external database of human heads around the world, factoring in ethnicity, gender, pupillary distance, nose bridge structure and a host of other metrics. With all of the data combined, he'll distill out final deliverable standards for materials, weights and pressure points -- all critical factors towards defining the best experience for the widest range of users. Bernie's got a big task ahead of him, but he's making great progress on perfecting the final fit of the Glyph. The research continues.... Team Avegant The electrical engineering team shared an update on cabling with us this month that we thought you might enjoy. If anyone remembers the setup on the Glyph Alpha prototype, we were effectively running HDMI signals into each eye after routing them through power injectors plugged into the wall. We've now successfully moved power onboard into a battery and simplified the electronics to only require one cable between the source and the Glyph. The picture above shows the former Alpha setup on the left with the product of our efforts and the developmental Glyph (note: not the final design) on the right. Not pictured, of course, is the Slimport, MHL or Lightning cable that goes to the phone, but you get the idea. Much goes into the process of routing a sole HDMI signal into two eyes separately (in 2D let alone 3D) that we wont get into now, but the fact of the matter is that we've overcome the biggest hurdle in cabling. From here we'll continue to build and refine. Have a nice weekend, Team Avegant Happy Friday from the sunny Redwood City offices of Avegant. We've been hard at work perfecting the internal Glyph electronics over the last few months, and things are going well. As part of that effort, we recently finished assembling and testing a Glyph prototype solely for engineering purposes -- one in which we can drop things like a set of optics or test connections specifically for product testing and verification. We call it the development prototype. Next week we're going to start sharing a few facets of the final design that have been successfully integrated into the development prototype, updates hot off the engineering line and ready for testing and validation. Later on, with all of the components tested and integrated, we'll work on perfecting the external industrial design and scaling up to manufacturing. You might be asking yourself about the look and feel of the current development prototype. A portion of the ergonomic updates are going to be integrated into this device, but the actual aesthetic outer structure is going to remain under wraps for a few months as we file the right paperwork and get our designers in order. Rest assured, the final design concept looks GREAT and we're working hard to marry it with the electronic insides -- we just want to make sure that everything's in order before we go live. Stay tuned for a few great updates about the electronics and the developmental prototype, and have a lovely weekend. Team Avegant We're growing once more. When Avegant was founded, we knew that our engineering, marketing and executive teams would have to expand rapidly, and the time has now come to add a manager with deep experience in successfully bringing consumer electronics to market. That person is Joerg Tewes. He'll join Avegant this month as our new CEO, working side by side with Ed and Allan to manage our operations. Ed will continue to work in his founding role on strategy, media and partnerships as Chief Strategy Officer, while Allan will continue to drive engineering and product development as Chief Technology Officer. Joerg comes to us with years of experience as Vice President and General Manager of the Digital Home Business Group at Logitech, where he oversaw the development and commercialization of numerous home electronics, including the Harmony remote control product family. Prior to that, he was the managing director of webcams at Logitech and also a Vice President of Engineering at Pinnacle Systems. In the short, he's the right person to shepherd this company from startup to consumer electronics powerhouse. Over the next few weeks we'll be introducing Joerg to the community and our partners as we continue to hone in on our manufacturing deadlines and our design iterations. Expect to see much from him, Ed and Allan as they continue to push through operations and build Avegant. We've passed a great milestone in bringing Joerg into the team, and we can't be more excited about what the future holds for us. Stay tuned for some great hardware updates we have in the works over the coming weeks and as always, thanks for your support. Team Avegant Glyphletes: A quick break from our regular programming to send a reminder about shipping addresses. We've been fielding a few questions each day about updated addresses and timing, so we figured a general message would be helpful for all. Here's how the eventual shipping process will work for those of you that backed our Kickstarter for a Glyph: Since the delivery date is still sliding based on the manufacturing timeline, we want to collect addresses only a few weeks prior to shipping. This ensures that everyone is in their most updated location prior to sending out orders -- we'd hate for a Glyph to be sent to your old address. Kickstarter actually has tools to orchestrate this; once we're ready to start collecting addresses you'll get a survey directly from Kickstarter that specifically solicits your info. In case you're wondering (and depending on what reward level you chose), there will also be a survey for what specific colors and other configurations you want. Waiting stinks, we know. Rest assured that once we need addresses we'll call. Team Avegant image credit: The nice people at Digital Kitchen . Greetings Glyphletes, As promised, we put together a brief survey to capture your thoughts on the upcoming and future Glyph. Take the survey here . We'd love your thoughts. The survey should take less than ten minutes and it'll give us valuable insight into our important community. On Monday, the 18th of August we'll grab 12 email address from the collection of completed surveys and send out Frisbees. Don't delay! Thanks again - Team Avegant Hey Glyphletes! During our Kickstarter campaign we received a ton of suggestions about product features from members of the Avegant community. The suggestions covered a huge range of applications and technologies, opening our minds to how many end-uses we globally face. Some plan to use the Glyph as a display for their home computer; others want to use it for interactive gaming; still others are planning to use it to watch movies and web content while commuting. We want to know more about how you ultimately plan on using your Glyph. While the hardware specifications for our first release are close to finalized, your feedback will help us shape our plans for the future and even impact the engineering work that is going on today. We value your opinion and want your voices heard! Tomorrow we'll be sending out a survey to all of you who contributed to the campaign. We'd love if you could tell us a bit about yourself and give us your thoughts on how you'd eventually like to use the Glyph. As an incentive, we'll be sending out a dozen Frisbees to a random set of respondents. Expect to hear back on that next Monday, the 18th, so get your responses in by then! Thanks as always for your continued support. -Team Avegant Hey everyone, it’s Allan Evans (Avegant's CTO) taking over this Kickstarter newsletter for a quick important shipping update. Our Kickstarter backers are one of our most important resources at Avegant, so I want you all to be the first to know that our preorder delivery is going to be pushed back. It’s been an extremely busy year so far and we’ve made amazing progress in building out and scaling the Glyph. Our engineering team has more than tripled in size. We’ve hired an industrial designer and augmented his work with a local firm, and they have been running at full speed making the Glyph as beautiful and comfortable as possible. We’ve consolidated the entire engineering team in a single office in the Bay Area and are well into the process of formalizing relationships with manufacturers, shippers and distributors. Most importantly, we’ve been constantly refining the Glyph prototypes with the user experience at the forefront of our process. We are working long productive hours and it seems like every engineer is living in the office. (Good thing we get along!) There’s much more to do. Our great challenge at Avegant is delivering a Glyph that meets my expectations as CTO, meets your expectations as early adopters, and perfectly marries our technology with mechanical engineering and industrial design. If we get any of those wrong – say just about everything works perfectly and is delivered on time but the flip-down mechanism is slightly imperfect – then we have created a product that doesn't meet our promise to deliver an amazing user experience. So far, we have already invented and patented several new optical, mechanical, and electrical components just to make the Glyph meet the high performance demands that a near eye display requires. Now we need to combine these inventions together to carefully build and test the next-generation prototypes. I’ve been actively working with our engineering team and our board members to refine the manufacturing and shipping schedule over the last weeks – one that will deliver a product both steeped in engineering excellence and with the high standards of our important community. Right now, that forecast pushes our delivery past our intended delivery date. We'll know exactly when once our manufacturing profiles start to take shape. Approving of this delay was one of the hardest decisions I have ever had to make. We chose to build the best Glyph possible rather than manufacture and ship a design that only incrementally improved the Glyph Alpha. After seeing several of the major improvements we have made and watching the industrial design mature, I am absolutely sure you will appreciate that decision. If you read between the lines above, there’s also some great news for you early backers: because of our extra prototyping cycles, we’re skipping the beta product and moving our delivery straight to the consumer product. This means you’ll get all of the functionality and reliability of the final Glyph that people at Best Buy or Amazon receive (including warranty) in addition to the awesome personalization like color selection, engraving and custom LEDs and cables based on your Kickstarter selections. And that’s with a delivery before anyone else on the consumer market. Your first question is undoubtedly going to be "So when exactly do I get my Glyph?" and believe me -- that's at the forefront of my mind as well. The answer is complicated. It's got to do with testing, manufacturing and precision, all things that we're meticulously tying together through the summer. While I can't give you an exact date, I can promise you two things. The first is that the Glyph that you receive is going to be even more amazing than anything we envisioned during the original Kickstarter campaign. I walk through the rows of engineers in our Redwood City office and am amazed daily at the innovation and creativity going into this product. To me it is humbling and it’s inspiring -- and I know you'll feel the same way too. The second promise that I want to make is even more communication and transparency from the company as the timeline comes into focus. Our marketing team has been doing superb work in maintaining our social profiles, updating our forums and sending updates out to the pre-order communities. With this delay, I've asked them to double down on their efforts, increase the volume of updates and do everything they can to maintain an open and transparent forum for you to communicate with us. If it isn't obvious, you need to know that we're here, we're working hard and that we're not going away. Between now and delivery we’ve built interim milestones into our schedule for both our community and our board to gauge our progress. Expect us to wrap up our design phase for the final product shortly, then produce tactile models of those prototypes through year’s end. Initial production runs come after that and can often take several months. Our team will also continue to take part in industry conferences and community events as scheduled – we’ll have tons of demos and updates to share. I hope you’ll forgive me for pushing back our delivery date to meet these high standards. Kickstarter is a fantastic crowd sourcing mechanism, but it’s also a commitment to work together and support projects that we love and believe in. The road may be a bit longer now, but I’m fully committed to delivering a Glyph to you that will be functional and lovable for many many years. All my best, Dr. Allan Evans – CTO Avegant P.S. - We've started a thread on the forums if you want to discuss the schedule and our thought process in pushing back delivery. I'll see you over there. The most frequent questions we get at Avegant about the Glyph technology have to do with the fit and the form factor. “How heavy is it on your nose?” “Is a head strap necessary?” “Why are you including audio?” Surprisingly, these are some of the most important challenges we’re facing today. Those who saw the Glyph Alpha prototypes know that the image quality is exceptional and that we can easily deliver the technology into your eye. But if we can’t package that display into a device that’s ergonomic and comfortable for all of our users then the product is completely useless. We’ve put extra effort, thus, into our mechanical engineering and industrial design this summer, hiring Bernie Wildner as our head of industrial design as well as ramping up a design firm in San Francisco. Led by Bernie’s vision, we’ve been able to refine our concept of the original Glyph Beta and practically work through the range of ergonomic issues as well as any mechanical constraints set by the engineering design. Late last month, prototypes reflecting that global industrial design started coming off the 3D printers. We’re thrilled with the process so far, and already have a variety of concepts in which we can start packaging electronics -- one of our favorites is above. Stay tuned for more details in the coming weeks. Before we go we should briefly share that our new website should be launching this week. The new design better-illustrates the flip-down mechanism that is so critical to the Glyph’s value, and it also integrates our forums, social feeds and some of the videos we’ve been putting together as case studies. Check back midweek to see the final product. That’s it for now – have a good week! Team Avegant Lots of work in the last two weeks on refining the Beta prototype and building out the foundation for strong manufacturing. You might remember in our last update that we prototyped the flip-down-and-lock mechanism. We've been able to successfully integrate that with a new visor prototype to test the wholly integrated system. -- and we're happy to report that the entire new mechanism is working smoothly. We're now much more confident in our users' ability to consistently and smoothly transition from audio to video mode. One of our designs with a thinner visor is below (note the lock near the base of the visor). Though we have several iterations of industrial design to cycle through, we're making tons of progress. Separately, we've been trying to build the foundation of the company to prepare for not only our Kickstarter manufacturing and delivery but also for the future of Avegant. The primary goal, of course, is to deliver a quality product that fulfills our Kickstarter (and preorder!) commitments. In addition to that though, we we need to start building out the company to prepare for legacy support, later versions and a better, stronger Avegant. It wouldn't be much use to ship a series of Glyph Betas if the company couldn't support and build upon them. Fortunately we've been blessed with strong leadership and some smart advisers in Silicon Valley. This month we hired three mechanical engineers, an industrial designer, and an executive assistant. And we've locked down some nice new office space outside of Redwood Shores, California for the team to share. Without a doubt, scaling our prototypes to a full production is going to be our biggest challenge, and the recent additions to our team will help us work towards our goals faster. With our new resources in place we're currently in the process of refining our roadmap and working with our suppliers on our ideal timeline. We should know more about how precisely we can deliver in a few weeks. In the meantime, we remain committed to working on engineering and doing minimal work in the public eye. We skipped the Augmented World Expo and E3, knowing that the same media don't need to see the same Alpha prototype that we've been carrying around the planet. But we did pop up briefly at Glazed Conference in SF (above), in last month's Wired and we'll be in an upcoming spot on Gadget Man in the UK. Keep an eye out for that later this summer -- here's a teaser: Thanks as always for your continued support and patience. Avegant and the Glyph are going to be very strong at the end of this campaign. We couldn't have done it without you guys. Team Avegant Hello Glyphletes, A few nice updates as May plods into the summer and we continue development of the Glyph Beta. One of the most unique facets of the Glyph design is the ability to use the device in headphone or video mode -- the whole flip-down visor concept. That design requires a very robust mechanism to rotate the headphones while the ear cans stay in place, and we're happy to report that we've made some good progress in building that out. A prototype of the mechanism (without integrated optics) is below. That black panel outside of the ear can and inside of the white plastic actually allows the headband to rotate up and down. Those who tried the Glyph Alpha probably noticed how clunky the transition is between audio and video mode. With these changes, the movement should be easier, faster and more durable. Separately, our finance team has been in digging through the issues of Value Added Tax for shipping Glyph Betas internationally. VAT for a company like ours is complicated because rules vary by country and we don't want our early backers to suffer the burden of any egregious fees. So we're going to make it official: Avegant will be covering the VAT for all shipped rewards. The shipping fee for all Glyph Betas on the current preorder page at avegant.com will also cover VAT. We're still working out duty as it depends on how the Glyph will be classified. We should have more information on that this summer. Beyond those updates we've been keeping pretty quiet on the media front in an effort to stay focused on engineering and logistics. Check out this story from Crain's that came out this month (opens in PDF) if you're interested in another company profile. In the meantime, we'll be hard at work. Team Avegant. Hello there Glyphletes, If any of you follow us on Facebook or Twitter you may have noticed that we got our batch of Avegant Science Fuel in last week. We're going to start shipping those rewards (from the $50 level) as well as Frisbees (from the $25 level) next week. As part of that, we need to send a survey to everyone who pledged at those levels to capture your current shipping info. Please keep an eye out for that email from Kickstarter later this week and try to get it complete by next Monday. We'll be processing a big batch of boxes on Monday and Tuesday. In addition to the engineering efforts over the past few weeks, we've been working hard at building and establishing our community of users, and one particular area of focus has been the forums. Thanks to a variety of backdoors and loopholes in the Vanilla forum install that we're using, spam has been rampant, making it nearly impossible to participate in the discussions without digging through pages of detritus. Last week, after a fortnight of trying to install a battery of spam solutions on our own, we called in some external developers to help fix the problem. We're in the process of testing those solutions right now – you may have already noticed a lighter load of spam – and hopefully we can get back to business shortly. We encourage you to stop by the forums this week; there are already a few great threads going strong. Otherwise, you can always lob product questions, cat videos and general banter over to us on the social medias. Finally, with engineering and production ramping up to full speed we've decided to expand our office out in San Francisco. With the range of resources and talents available to us in the Bay Area it's really best for us to focus our efforts out there. Our production schedule means that we're also expanding our team beyond our core electrical and mechanical engineers. Right now we're looking to selectively hire: Electrical engineers Mechanical engineers Senior industrial designers An office administrator A bookkeeper If you've got experience in working with optomechanical systems or scaling up consumer electronics and you're interested in joining an amazing team that's building the next generation of near eye displays, please reach out. Send a cover letter and resume over to <email> and we'll take a look. Note as well that we can only hire US citizens. Thanks to all for your patience with the forums and the team as we work through a variety of solutions and get them implemented. We're sorry it's taken so long – the community is a core component of Avegant's future – but a solution should be in place. We look forward to seeing you there. Team Avegant Happy spring everyone. Maybe it will stick this time. Things have been moving along nicely on several fronts here at Avegant and we wanted to give you an update on the happenings-on. While it’s always been our goal to stay focused and work on engineering during the spring and summer months, a few nice opportunities on the media front have presented themselves. Over the course of the last several weeks a few of us met some great folks at the Game Developer’s Conference and Macworld in San Francisco, walking away from the latter event as one of the two best breaking technologies within the entire conference. We also joined the Immersive Technology Alliance with a few other leading near eye display companies. On the engineering front, we’re working hard to update the Glyph Alpha with electronics and optics that will be part of the Glyph Beta that you finally receive. We just developed and are in the process of testing a new set of video boards (above) that will help deliver the final, high-quality theater experience. And a new set of optics have been tested that cut down on any field curvature at the edges of the image, meaning a better, sharper picture. So if any of you recall the image quality of the Glyph Alpha demos – well, it’s going to improve even further. Neil (VP of Engineering) is going to be integrating those optics into one of the Glyph Alphas for testing this month, and we'll be continuing our evaluation through the summer. Speaking of staff, we’re bringing in specialists in optical and mechanical engineering at the end of the month to help us expand our design and manufacturing footprint. The acquisitions are careful, measured moves to strengthen our team and build in-house capabilities; we’re looking forward to introducing you all in May. Beyond that, we remain optimistic about our manufacturing timeline and the quality of the displays that we're producing. All manufacturing efforts face unforeseen difficulties and snags -- we expect adversity -- but on our current pathway we're still looking good for a late 2014 delivery. We'll keep you updated. Team Avegant. Happy spring everyone. Only three weeks have passed since the conclusion of our Kickstarter campaign and we wanted to give you an update on the happenings at Avegant. First up: business. Kickstarter and Amazon should have successfully billed each of you for the amount pledged during the campaign. A few of you had issues with declined/canceled credit cards and either Grant or Jonathan should have reached out to you in the past week to help rectify any problems. If you haven’t heard anything at all from us, please send us another note in the Kickstarter messages. Though unlikely, it’s possible that a few emails slipped through the cracks. It’s important to note that we have a modest amount of time to sort out any transactional issues and get the campaign rewards sorted out. When we have manufacturing sussed out and an idea of our material limitations, we’ll send a survey out asking for specifics on your pledges (colors, etchings etc) as well as requesting a shipping address. That survey will likely come in the second quarter of 2014. Backers who signed up for Science Fuel or frisbees will get theirs sooner. On the engineering side of things, our team has been very busy laying the foundation for the mechanics of the Glyph Beta. A spectrum of our partners in all corners of the design are ramping up to full speed and we should have some refined designs to show you all in the next few weeks. Already we’ve made improvements to the power source. For those of you who saw us at one of the road shows or other physical demos, you probably noticed the assortment of cables that we had interlaced into the research prototypes. In our pathway to an independent, onboard power solution, we’ve created an external battery box to make the Glyph prototypes more agile and portable. Next step: integrating that power box into the Glyph form factor. Though the lion’s share of our work has been on engineering tasks, we’ve also spent a bit of time on the marketing side keeping the community up to speed with the Glyph technology. This week we spent a good chunk of time at South by Southwest showing off the technology, and Yobie’s friend Snoop tried to give us a shout out on Engadget . We also got great spots on CNBC , Discovery News (upcoming!) and CBS This Morning as well as the top prize in the SXSW accelerator speed pitches. Coming up, we’ll have small presences at the Game Developer’s Conference next week as well as Macworld the week after. If you have specific needs or interests at either of those conferences, send Grant an email at grant.martin[AT]avegant[dot]com and set up a meeting; we wont be on the show floor at GDC and we’re in the midst of setting up a kiosk at the Macworld conference. More on that soon. We’ll also keep you all posted on any other public demos going on over the next few weeks. Sadly, we can’t do private demos for our backers at GDC or Macworld, but if there’s enough demand we’ll be sure to set up a happy hour here or there. And we already have a few things in the works. That should be all for now. Rest assured that we're all extremely busy. See you all on the road. Team Avegant Greetings Kickstarter Backers, We finished the Kickstarter funding portion of our campaign this morning at a point just over $1.5M, six times our initial goal of $250,000. Thank you so much for your contribution. Dozens of interested supporters have been asking about how they can get a Glyph Beta after the campaign, so we've updated our homepage to include a portal for continued presales. Backers can continue to order Glyph Betas via Shoplocket over at avegant.com , though delivery on those units will be later than on the Kickstarter units. It's been a wild ride and we can't thank our backers enough for joining us -- but the journey is just beginning. From here we're putting our entire effort into engineering and scaling up production. We have immediate meetings in California next week and Asia and Texas over the next month, plus lots to do in laying the foundation for the future of our company. We expect to keep you well-informed on our process. Look for updates every 1-2 weeks over the course of the year and all sorts of outreach and social media. In the meantime, we're going to be scaling up our presence on the Avegant Forums, so if you have comments or discussions, head over there and jump into the fray. Additionally, a few of us will be at South by Southwest in early March. Feel free to reach out if you're going to be in town. That should do it for now. We have to get back to work and start looking towards December. We'll be here if you need us -- on the weekends, late at night. Stop by the forums and say hi. Oh and while we're saying thanks, our partners at Texas Instruments and Tekna also wanted to chip in and send you their best. We'll leave the floor with them on the way out. From Texas Instruments : Texas Instruments DLP® technology enables power efficient, bright, high resolution images rich with color, contrast and clarity for a broad number of applications ranging from near-eye display to digital cinema projectors. TI is excited to supply our latest, cutting edge DLP® Pico™ technology to Avegant, enabling the Glyph to create a cinema-like experience in a wearable form factor. For more information on DLP® Pico™, please visit <url>– out. On the Glyph Alpha, our team lead the initial conceptual development, detailed mechanical development and component packaging, as well as the final exterior aesthetic design. Tekna is a full service product development firm with over 25 years of experience in the medical and consumer product industries. Check out our full line of capabilities on our homepage . Thanks again everyone. See you on the forums. Ed, Allan, Yobie, Mark, Neil, Aaron, Jonathan, Emma and Grant Hey everyone. We're back in the United States for all-hands-on-deck during the final days of our campaign. Thanks for being patient with us as we jetlagged our way around the roadshow and dozens of business meetings; while we're trying our best to keep things organized and calm, not all queues can work quietly and quickly. We're sorry about that. We had some good meetings in London ironing out logistics for shipping, and we want to give you all some insight into how that process is going. Ultimately, it looks like we're going to be setting up distribution channels in the UK and maybe a couple of other spots around the world to localize shipping and reduce extraneous fees for the consumers. Which exact warehouses and carriers we choose is still in process, but the goal is to move shipping as close to our consumers as possible and thereby reduce fees. Right now we can't give exact numbers and costs because we don't know the exact weight of the packaging and the laws and fees in your home countries. Know, however, that we're working as hard as possible to keep shipping costs low for our backers. If we can come up with an even better solution over the course of the year -- whether that's with a expedited private jet or Allan going door to door with a donkey cart -- we'll look into it. As we pass the T-36 hour mark until project completion, some have been asking about stretch goals at $1.25 or $1.5M. We don't have plans to include additional stretch goals at this point; engineering is at maximum capacity and we're working hard to finish this campaign strong, so we're going to stay focused on keeping the ship stable. The team should be back in the office for the next 38 hours answering questions and seeing to a clean completion of the campaign. Thanks to all of you for your thoughts on stretch goals and shipping. We're almost at the finish line. Team Avegant Greetings from London, Glyphletes. It's been a busy week at Avegant, with several of the team in London, several in New York and still others on the west coast of the US. On Wednesday we stopped by the Kickstarter HQ in Brooklyn, NY to show off the technology and talk about global strategy. Little did we know that Kickstarter would have a security breach that day and that all of our accounts would be compromised. Luckily, it doesn't appear that any unauthorized actvity has taken place -- Amazon does all of the payment processing after all -- but we strongly recommend that you change your Kickstarter password. One can never be too safe. Moreover, we want to underscore that continuting (or initiating) your support of the Glyph on Kickstarter does not put you at further risk for data loss. Our friends at Kickstarter resassure us that the breach was localized, that the hole has been closed and that credit card data are safe. We trust them to stay on top of the situation. Moving on, a brief update on shipping. We're in London early this week to look into a few international shipping options. This week there's a big push to resolve any unknown questions on this front so that everyone can have full visibility into their cost commitments. We promise to give you all of the details before the campaign ends, but to reiterate: we are working very hard on shipping solutions. Expect more from us on the campaign timeline and shipping later this week. The home stretch is upon us. Team Avegant Good news Glyphletes, we crossed the $1M funding goal yesterday afternoon. Helping us along the way was a top-notch interview that Ed gave on CNBC's Squakbox this Tuesday and a nice spot from CNN . As promised, we're locking in the $1M stretch goal of custom engraving on each shipped Glyph. We'll send out details on that process (as well as opt-outs) later in the campaign. Looking at the spectrum of comments that have been rolling in, we realized that we need a better forum in which to discuss the myriad issues and opportunities that backers will face in the next year. So we've installed the Avegant Forums to get that community started. We're in the process of updating the forums right now, including a FAQ download and some of the other foundational content. But if you want to stop by and get your own discussion rolling, then please feel free. And if you see any gaps, let us know. We'll be testing and updating the forums for the next few days and then we'll push it out to a wider audience. Don't forget, we have roadshows coming up in South Bay (tonight!), Boston and Seattle too. Cheers, Team Avegant As some of our early backers begin to get settled and comfortable with our campaign, several have been asking about the mechanism for shipping the Glyphs later this year. Overseas shipping and duty can often be onerous for international backers, and we're extremely sensitive to any excessive fees that could disrupt our community. So we're going to spend some time over the next week researching possible shipping mechanisms and classifications for the Glyph Betas that will soon be delivered. Rest assured that we're doing our best to keep taxes and other fees low and we have a few possible avenues to pursue. We should have more insight on the process later this week. In the meantime, most of us on the team will be crisscrossing the country getting manufacturing ramped up and ironing out any press coverage that the Glyph is garnering. Tentatively, Ed is going to be on CNBC on Tuesday morning at 6:20 AM talking about the technology, while Allan, Aaron and Neil will be in Boston working on scaling up our manufacturing. Since we'll already be in New England, we're going to add a roadshow in Boston for the evening of Monday, February 10th -- probably in Cambridge (go Crimson) -- but we'll confirm the spot this week. Until then, you can sign up for free tickets here . We also added a show in the South Bay (San Francisco) for Thursday, February 6th. Tickets to that are here . No more shows are are in the works at this time. Oh, we mentioned Aaron and Neil in the above paragraph. Aaron is one of our hardware leads and Neil is our VP of Engineering. Both graduated from the University of Michigan along with several of the guys on the team, Aaron with his MS and Neil with his PhD. Since leaving college, Aaron has been working for Google while Neil has been leading engineering teams in Ohio. Both are great, patient cornerstones of the company, and if you come to the happy hour in Boston you may see them. During our happy hour in Chicago we had the chance to shoot a few photos with Grant's SLR. It was nice seeing several of our backers at the event, particularly Jeff J, who wrote a lavish commentary on the experience at AVS forums. Check out the thread if you get a spare six or seven hours. We'll close with a few photos of the event in Chicago. Thanks to those who made it out and those still coming to future events -- they've been a blast so far. Team Avegant Hey everyone, With questions coming in from multiple directions (thanks to Crowdfundingforum , the Kickstarter Message Boards, the Kickstarter comment pages, Star Citizen , AVS Forums and a zillion commenters on Engadget ) we thought it might be fun to get Ed and Allan, our CEO and CTO respectively, together to answer some fast-fire questions from the community. A great forum for that is actually on Reddit , so starting at noon New York time (that is, NOW) we'll have the guys there answering questions. Feel free to drop in, say hi and ask any ridiculous question you can muster. Here's the link . Enjoy the discussion. Team Avegant Hey everyone, After listening to the Glyph comment threads and fielding an inbox full of messages, we wanted to lock in the $1M stretch goal for custom engraving. This means that ALL of our Kickstarter backers who buy a Glyph or Glyph special edition during the campaign will have the option to engrave a limited edition message and the backer number on the side of the left ear can. We'll vote on the precise language after the campaign closes and you can opt out of any part (or all of) the engraving as well. Thanks to everyone who weighed in on the $1M stretch goal process and to those who understand the difficulty of meeting challenging engineering milestones. We're doing our best to make you all happy and keep you engaged, so please forgive us if the message is occasionally foggy. At the end of the day, we're all still getting Glyphs! Today begins week two of our campaign. Wish us luck as we push through the middle. We're headed to the Chicago event to shoot some photos for you all. Team Avegant Day six! As we enter the middle of our campaign with some insight into our Kickstarter funding pathway, we're kicking off some internal engineering efforts and ironing out all of the media coverage that is filtering through the grapevine. As part of that, we were thrilled to discover that we broke the funding record for the fastest to raise a goal of $250,000. That's a pretty great feeling. Thanks to everyone who helped make that happen. To date, our stretch goals have helped create wider variety of body color options and soft-shell cases with all shipped Glyphs. We've also decided to globally include noise cancelling, which was our original $1M stretch goal. Looking forward, at $1M we want to continue that line of incentives while carefully balancing the load on our engineers and infrastructure. So far, designing and manufacturing the Glyph has been an enormous effort for us. We've given years of engineering research, sleepless nights, Sunday-night phone calls and redeye flights to bringing the Glyph to this stage, and we're happy to be giving you a product that we're proud of. Because of that, we want to hold off on making any aggressive hardware changes to the Glyph Beta as a stretch goal. Adding components like cameras or extra wireless antennas can mean extra engineering cycles and delays in the manufacturing process, and that puts our deliverable deadlines at risk. We have to stay focused on meeting that deadline so that you can have your Glyph in hand as soon as possible. We do, however, want to reward our Kickstarter backers for your loyalty and early investment, so we're looking into design modifications strictly for campaign backers. Right now, we're looking into engravings with the backer number and "Kickstarter Edition" on the left ear (opposite the control wheel). If the manufacturing on that pans out, we'll make it official tomorrow. Thanks to all of you for your continued support and wealth of ideas during the mid-campaign. We assure you all that we're reading each comment and discussing every single update and stretch goal. At the end of the day, you'll receive the best Glyph that we can possibly produce. Team Avegant Hey everyone, happy Monday from the frigid middle of America. There was a lot of discussion in our comments this weekend about stretch goals and further incentives for backers as our funding extends beyond our initial goal of $250,000. Thanks to all of you for your feedback and insight. Stretch goals for us are a great way to expand the footprint and applicability of the Glyph and we're excited to explore a variety of options for the final Glyph Beta deliverable. We're being careful in what we commit to, though, because we want to make sure that we don't overpromise or overextend ourselves. Building and designing the Glyph itself is an extremely articulate and time-consuming process, and it took almost two years to get to the point of the Alpha prototype. Adding stretch goals like onboard cameras and wider fields of view represents a significant overhaul to the hardware system and puts our ultimate deliverable deadline at risk. We want to be careful about setting realistic goals. Similarly, we can't overload the project with too many stretch goals and engineering milestones. With that said, we have a few solid ideas for the $1M stretch goal. Our engineering team is currently running some numbers and we should have resolution for you tomorrow. And look! We’re almost at our $750,000 stretch goal! Huzzah! Speaking of staff, now's a good time to introduce you to a few of our team members. You probably are already familiar with Ed Tang, our CEO whose mug is on the Kickstarter campaign. Ed has been working as an electrical engineer in the Ann Arbor area for the last ten years as both an entrepreneur and investor. He has a great deal of experience in hardware development and is the team's patient leader and compass. Allan Evans is our CTO and is the father of the Glyph technology. After getting his doctorate in Electrical Engineering from the University of Michigan, he worked on micromirror development in a national lab for several years before moving back to Ann Arbor to start Avegant with Ed. Allan is our most ebullient team member. The person from whom you get most communication (and typos) is Grant Martin. Grant graduated as a Materials Engineer and worked additionally as a writer and editor at AOL and the BBC prior to getting recruited to Avegant by the other engineers. He and Allan used to play frisbee together. We also have a handful of other scientists running around the country showing off the technology and developing the next generation of the Glyph. We'll introduce them in future updates. It has been a very busy week for all of us, but we're working exceptionally -- sleeplessly in many cases -- hard to make sure this campaign runs properly and that you all get the Glyphs (and coffees and frisbees) that you deserve. We appreciate your patience as we balance communication and engineering. To help simplify things we've distilled many of the questions in our comments out into a new Kickstarter-designed FAQ at the bottom of the main campaign page. Please take a look through that to see if it answers any of your outstanding questions. As you probably guessed, there's much to discover. We'll be back with more updates on the new stretch goals tomorrow. Thanks to everyone for a great weekend of fundraising. Team Avegant Day Three. We're slowly starting to dig out of the initial orders and questions. Thanks again to everyone who supported us so far, you've been awesome. We talked among the team about stretch goals and have come to a few decisions. At $500K (that is, yesterday), we're going to expand the number of available body colors for the regular Glyph $499 contribution or the $499 special edition to include Red, Green and Orange. LED and HDMI colors will remain blue and black respectively on the regular edition. Customized LED and HDMI colors for the special edition will remain among the currently offered options. You'll be able to pick your colors after the campaign is finished. At $750K we'll include a basic semi-rigid fabric protective case with all shipped Glyphs (excluding the $999 version with a customized case). We still haven't picked the precise design yet, but we'll send that out later. We'll update the home Kickstarter page with details of the stretch goals (and we'll post some new renderings at Avegant's homepage) but we wanted to let you all know the details first. Moving on, our Roadshow page has been updated to reflect new events in Dallas and Austin. We are also working on a South Bay event in addition to the currently planned happy hour in San Francisco. Finally, we also fixed the broken links on the Roadshow page. Onward and upward. Thanks to everyone for their feedback and their continued support. After an amazing 24 hours we're finally coming up for air, and we couldn't be more thrilled with results. In just over four hours we were able to blow past our original funding goal of $250,000, and we're now just short of doubling it at $500,000. THANK YOU -- so much -- to everyone for your help in getting the Avegant Glyph off the ground and for making a commitment to back this project. We're confident in our manufacturing and our design teams, and want to reiterate our commitment to delivering rewards to your door later in the year. We plan on shipping Glyphs out as quickly as they are manufactured, and we plan on delivering units in the order that you backed them. Your first-day effort to support us means you will be the very first ones to get Glyphs in your hands! It's now time to start mapping out our stretch goals and our plans for bringing the Glyph Alpha prototype out into the community. The team is working hard to identify and design perks that we can give to our backers at the $500k, $750k and $1M levels, and we should have more concise details on the nature of those awards tomorrow. Now that you have supported us to the point where we know that manufacturing will proceed, we want to continue to spread the word about the Glyph and strengthen our network. As part of that we're inviting you out to the Avegant Roadshow . Since the Glyph is such an eyes-on experience, we've decided to bring the physical alpha prototypes to select cities around the world and demonstrate how the technology works. If you looked into this kickstarter and heard the skeptics ask "but how does it REALLY look inside?" then this is your chance to bring them out and show them how amazing it is! Tickets are free and in most cases, drinks are provided. Check out roadshow.avegant.com for details and keep an eye out! The first event is TOMORROW in Miami! Thanks again everyone! We'll update you with stretch goals tomorrow. The Avegant Team
