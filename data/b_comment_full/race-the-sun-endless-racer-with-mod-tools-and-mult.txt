Congrats upon your arrival on Wii U, that's super-cool! Now, is there any chance that us backers who are Nintendo fans will get an eShop download code, pretty-please? ;-) Thanks for delivering a fun game! If we haven't gotten our Steam keys yet, is something wrong? Congrats on getting onto Steam, btw! Yeah, just got it now! Thanks a lot! Excellent game and I wish you guys further success. Awesome work getting on Steam! Congrats, and I hope it brings you more sales. Will backers get Steam keys? Awesome news today in backers inboxes!~Check it! I hate to be That Guy, but you guys said you were releasing in June, for definite. It is now July, and you haven't really done an update since 0.40, so... What exactly is going on? Whats the hold up? This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. Ideas and brainstorming! - New POWER: Sand clock. What does: it stops the sun from going down for about 30 seconds. - New POWER: Brake. It give you the change to slow down the ship for 3-4 seconds, so you can avoid crashing with objects. - New Score idea: Grabbing another item power that you already had (like another jump) it gives you 3 Tris score (so you will keep on item hunting taking risking maneuvers) - New Score idea: Red Tris. They are pretty hidden in the most dangerous places and are equal to 5 Tris. Rare item. - New MODE: Practice mode. Easy select a few already discovered "traps" like tunnels and made infinite stages with just those items, so you can master them. Just played the beta, great work guys! me too man :) Btw, in the game there should be like a "near-miss" meter when you fill it, you get like a bonus or something and like perhaps some sort of speedometer/sun dial so you can tell a little better how the "day" is going. Oh man, I'm so glad it got funded, this is the one game that deserves it the most, great (re)work Flippfly and thanks everyone pledging! :-D Everyone!!! UPVOTE Greenlight Reddit Page! <url>"ohh, wow, they made it, i remember that pic on kickstarter/online." TL;DR: Please use the same illustrated image at least for the primary thumbnail. Dang! I try again: Congratulations to everybody (specially to Aaron and Forest)! I've written a brief article on GamingOnLinux about the success: <url>~mya YES! Such a happy thing to wake up to. Congrats Flippfly! It is done :) Ah almost 21.5 k :D 12$ More :D Yet another campaign saved at the very last hour. Yet another proof that it is worth not giving up until it is really over. :) Can't wait to see how far Race the Sun will go. ^^ YES! You guys made it! Oh man I'm so happy for you guys and I can't wait to see this game develop into one of my most favorite games ever! Just remember: OUYA and Race the Sun would go perfectly together! Yayyyyyyyy Proud to be a backer - this game looks hypnotic and beautiful Aww yiss! Glad to see everything worked out :) Congratulations Devs :) OH HELL YEAH.... (just got back from work in time it seems) Congratulations guys! Awesome! I agree to Josh Burkhead... an OUYA port would be so nice. ;) YES!! I can't wait to play it in the future. If there's any possible way to port this game to OUYA I'd be so grateful. Good luck in the future and I'm so glad to be supporting this awesome project. Yaaaaaay you made it! =) Yesss ! Congratulations, you really deserve it ! \o/ Wooo! Congrats! :D "Doing the happy dance" Down the the wire, guys. But it happened. Good luck with the rest of development. Congrats! Congratulations! Yeah let's go above 21k or even 22k to have a nice cushion. I meant to say, to Flippfly, that more rewards for people giving $20-$25 would help... Yay !!! \o/ Okay, a few more dollars and everyone will be set. more $20/$25 dollars levels would help a bit. Remember sometimes a few odd backings fail with the credit card transactions. Everyone should bear this in mind while getting a few more dollars in. I am now much poorer than I would be yesterday lol *not impressive.... daft no edit feature what a run up at the end ;) Oh My God! And not in that crappy way, when something really is that impressive. Well done, this is a great comeback! Congratulations! Congrats!! There. 20k! *cheers* And then it happened... WOHOO! It's funded! @Flippfly I agree w/Luke. If there's a next time, decrease the "goal" by 5-10%, and also have your "primary" reward be at $15. That way it only takes half as many. Most kickstarter backers are used to the $15 price point anyways, so it's nothing surprising. It's half as many backers needed too. But though you KNOW I adore this game with all the effort I and the rest of the backers put in, I thought incentives could have been either different or switched around a bit. If you wanna know what I think, just message me, but other than that... It looks like we're here!!! *Drake voice* started from the bottom now we here! $150 to go :) updated my pledge for the 2nd time. I think we will make it in the next minutes! Thank god :D ported* im in! :D Supported! Wish you GL! Good luck! I just backed. Just a though for the future: you might want to think if there's more random stuff you can give to slightly higher tier backers. Maybe something like some ship skins for $15-20 backers, as I wasn't too interested in the soundtrack I only put $10 down and would need a slightly different incentive to do more. Anyway numbers are going up pretty quick as I type this so hopefully you'll hit $20k regardless. I think we're gonna make it! Keep sharing! Twitter & such. Tell your friends on steam too! This looks pretty good :) I just hope one day this will be portet to iOS, even though we'll not reach the Stretch Goal ^^ So happy to see this beinh funded :D YEAH! 1k! Woo! So 2 hours after my last comment, the gap has been halved, looking promising! Oh wow only 1.5k! Looks promising! Just bumped mine up to $30 from $15. What 4-5 hours? Lol I have a good feeling :) Just backed the projet and tweet about it. Hope you'll make it guys! It sounds pretty cool! $2k to go in the next 6 hours, just another 100 backers or everyone bumping their pledge up by a measly $2+change, hoping they make it Still optimistic, the haters underestimate the mod tools, this game has so much potential, best of luck. I'd say, take out a 1k loan lol or get a "mystery backer" aka an alt account and do that. At least raise it to 18.5k artificially lolll You actually did the cat with lasers :D As I said! People LOVE cats with lasers ^^ Upgraded my pledge too, 2.5k left! :D upgraded gl hf I added another $10, also from Death, Inc. as a failed project. If 1/2 of us all give an extra 10 they will have this. I vote the devs take out a 3k loan in the next 8 hours and keep it just in case =P. Upped my pledge for this... I had the extra funds due to Death Inc... T.T C'mon, just that little bit more to go! ~mya I've unfortunately given all I can, 30 bucks. I really hope this hits its mark. Will you guys consider IndieGogo after this so you can at least get part of the money? @Kyle @Xihui I agree with Kyle. They're both indie game devs building what they love. Why the hate? @Xihui That is hardly fair, especially since there is only one game that fits that description. I myself can't say I have played it, but, Planescape: Torment is widely considered to be a masterpiece and the names behind the project are definitely no slouches. I do wish they had more to give us in terms of gameplay video, there wasn't even much Wasteland 2 footage, and I most definitely agree that it would be sad if we can't make it to 20k, though I honestly think we'll make it to spare. Just found by kicktraq and backed. Looks pretty cool, hope this makes it, looks like it will. If most of those remaining hours were in the morning EST, we would definitely make it. Someone should post on the Torment ks. 1.5m in less than a day. Maybe get some sent over here lol WOW! Almost @ 17k already!? That was like 1k in 1 or 2 hours it feels like. Man I want this to succeed SOO hard lol Reddit Indie Gamer page showing a little love! SHAREEEEEEEEE LOL, no...but seriously though. you should share this or whatever you can :) <url>"Hunted: the demon's foge" which was also by betheseda...but it fell flat even though i was amped for it...but i looked at the video and i didn't really see anything :/ "This ones gonna be close..." doubled my pledge :) It is sad to see games on kickstarter talking all about their bullcrap story and no game play to reach a million dollars within hours and yet indie games like these struggle to reach 20 grand. Backed and shared, hope it reaches the goal, 12 more hours! I've doubled my pledge. Its going to take a BIG jump to raise another $4k, some chance. May up my pledge again but it was not in my budget. I The linux move was a good one, just wish it was declared from the start. *guy from waterboy* YOU CAN DO IT!!!! Keep it going!!! Must keep sharing Well - upped my pledge to 50 - hope others follow suit I just saw one of my friends post about this project on Facebook, so I thought I'd back you guys :-) I admire you quitting your jobs to work on something you truly love to do and believe in! Good luck! Just doubled my pledge from $8 to $16. Let's goooooooooooooooo!!! I probably shouldn't be spending more money, but I REALLY want this to succeed, upped my pledge to BETA TESTER. Keep up the awesome work guys! lets all say it together. "yes we can, yes we can" :) I'd say also for the rewards, add: 1. early forum access for $15 dollar pledges ( if you'll do forums) 2. Kickstarter pledges of maybe $20 get a "new alternate ship design" (in addition to the first one) that will be released maybe a month or two after initial release 3. Added to either $15 or $20 or whichever: backers credit in the game!!! People LOVE being recognized! I think it'd be great to add these quick & make an informal update! Stretch goal idea or future development idea: competitive multiplayer - head to head racing in the same game this is going to be a real race to the goal :) 17h and 5.2k left To fund this pledge: adding $8 to original pledge would truly help! We can do it guys!!! I just got on board. I'd love to see this run on my linux box. Every backer increase the pledge by 8 dollars, and it's funded... (I just increased mine from 30 to 150).... Why is this not funded? I I fund this and Project Awaken one failed I wont let this one. Feel free to share this video guys in addition to the other stuff: <url>"meetme" (LOT OF PEOPLE) and put the game up, PERSONALLY face booked all my friends, gonna make a vid, & gonna message all my steam friends individually in a bit. KEEP DA HOPE ALIVE!!!! Oh also reddited it too I'm gonna try to make a YouTube vid tonight about RtS, time is of the essence! Man I really want this game!!!!! with this spike in pledges of late there might just be a chance of this reaching its goal :) also i love the new stuff you added to the game like the big windmill Oh! Well I had school so as long as I can catch what I can now or tune in to what i missed, ill be cool You never said the date for the live stream unless it was today...and if it was can you put it up on YouTube as soon as you can so we can share? P.S. I have confidence it'll make it I can't stand seeing this not get the backing it deserves, so even though I paid for the Alpha demo and its subsequent updates, I'm backing this here as well. DAMN, this game needs way more backers, this looks so amazing :D I really hope this gets funded! I just pledged after seeing the new video and the cool "updated" thumbnail. It really draws you in more than the last one did. With only a few days left, I sincerely hope this game gets funded! Thinks this looks great, I'm backing! This is how a kickstarter for a game should be done: With a playable demo! Got me to donate. Hope this gets funded! So I hadn't seen the new video you guys put up until now, and it actually got me really interested in the game. The previous video I saw was pretty lackluster and didn't really convince me there was much of a game here, but holy crap, great job on some of those level designs. Keep juicing it and I can't wait to play a final version. :) Very cool guys. Good luck! I agree with a few others about the color. It needs just a bit more in some areas. Also, I wonder if the design of the ship needs just a little bit more. Nothing photo realistic, just something a bit more slick, with some extra particle effects on the engines. Can't say much more, as it looks fantastic, guys. Good luck, here's hoping a miracle happens and you get backed i do have a few other ideas. lets assume there is a very simple reason besides just powering your vehicle with the sun. you arent simply running towards something but away from something. with that in mind you could give the game a simple back story that could lead to greater gameplay variety. for example what if you are running away from some people that wish to capture you or worse because you stole some important research or artifact. so with this simple background story you can then add enemy chasers that try to either slow you down with tracker beams to capture you. which then escalates to trying to ram you into objects to destroy you. when these chasers cant accomplish the job the unknown pursuers send battle ships that fire gravity spikes at your ship. these spikes would have a pulsing green ring near the top to indicate their gravitational range so that you can avoid them. Put in my "2 cents" ($8) due to official Linux support. The browser demo kept me entertained all night, so I can't wait for a chance to play this on a big TV. Please keep looking into getting this on the OUYA. Trying to throw more support your way, and fingers crossed for a major push in the next 4 days. just noticed that i kinda repeated what was shown in new vid. sorry about that there isnt an edit button. also have you thought about going for a warmer color pallet instead of the graycale like theme because the gray might also be putting some people off, although not me. simply changing the color of the ground, kinda like in poster sketch #2, may make it more appealing. just a thought i think an aspect you arent really using is the shadows. the clouds casting shadows was a neat idea but when you are playing you arent looking up into the sky for clouds you are looking forward and the shadows of the clouds arent visible untill they are on you. atleast from my experience with the alpha version. so what i propose is that the large objects that cast large shadows have that same effect of causing yo to slow down and for the sun to fall faster but have those large objects have simple animation patterns that you can learn so that you can stay in the light while avoiding the shadows. the shadows become a type of environmental enemy. for example a giant gear that travels across the environment horizontally on its pegs and you have to travel horizontally with the gear to stay in the light path and then pass through the pegs to get past it or something. i got other ideas but they might be alittle hard to implement. I noticed that there's less than a week to go, and I was horrified when I saw that you guys didn't get the goal yet! I'm spreading information about this kickstarter where I can. I know that if you guys put it on OUYA, you'll get plenty more supporters. Some ideas for co-op multy play (taking inspiration in Journey): - The portals are not just for entering, they could jump ship into your play while you are playing! - You flight with a partner for awhile - You can flight in formation to get multipliers and special achievements - You need to keep the formation as much as you can. - Formations could be: One ship up, the other above, Or wing agains wing Also, maybe adding rolls (if there are not yet) could be just fun! Note: It's just an idea, don't know if that's possible or not, just sharing it! Fly on! You should really see if you can do a Linux release. Kickstarter games that support Linux can get some good coverage on many of the Linux news sites. i really like the alpha but im alittle worried about this not making its goal in time This game looks really cool! I would love to see an OUYA version I think OUYA is a must for this and, as a logical extension, Android. Love the visual styling. I have zero interest in ouya. I was an early bird backer that dropped out after two weeks. I usually get a little bothered when backers ask for a game that is obviously too much to run on ouya to be ported to the ouya. However, even I can agree that this is exactly the type of game that would probably be perfect to have an ouya release. THIS is just the kind of game I dreamed for when I pledged for the OUYA, last year: -Simple (but challanging) gameplay -Highly addictive gameplay and -Beautifuly polished minimalist design You should definitly make an OUYA version! Regarding Tylers advice; you might wanna try the Minecraft model. Which means selling access to the beta, with continued development and rolling updates. My advice: If you have a fun game you can ship now without all the extra dimensions, do it. Get revenue started. make an iPad version (seems natural). Use revenue from those sales to fund the extras you're asking for here. That said, I backed this and hope you succeed in getting your funding. cool game idea Looks great guys, good luck! Just backed, looks great. Viewpoint reminds me a little of Space Harrier. I know it isn't in keeping with the game, but any chance of a pew pew pew mode ? :D
