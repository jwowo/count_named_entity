Great news! We are finally ready to ship out your physical rewards! But you won’t receive yours …unless we have your correct mailing address. We emailed everyone who was supposed to receive a physical reward last week and asked you to verify your address. If you didn’t received that email, you have one more chance. Check your spam folder or verify your shipping information right here: <url>’t get your “goodies.” And, if your package is undeliverable, you’ll have to pay any additional shipping charges. As always, if you have questions, email us at <email> As Larry loves to say, “It won’t be long now!” FINALLY! LARRY INVADES APPLE STORE! Great News It's official! Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded is now for sale in the iOS App store and Mac store. Finally! We submitted the game on June 27th, but heard almost nothing until yesterday, when it went live. Sales have been healthy so far and the game has a 4-star rating! Remember: if you like the game, be sure to rate it – everywhere! The more positive reviews we have, the more we'll interest others in buying a copy and that's the only way we're going to get to make Leisure Suit Larry 2 . Some Bad News Something happened with our upload to the Android store and the version that's there now is bad. N-Fusion is working on the problem and thinks it's a simple fix but we won't know until we can find and fix the problem. So if you're looking for an Android version, please bear with us a little longer. It won't be long now. (Hey. That's what Larry said!) In case you didn’t read the earlier emails we’ve sent you, you should know: WE SHIPPED!! Maybe not every platform (although we sure tried) but people have been playing the PC, Mac and Linux games for a week. You should be too! That said, Apple has been sitting on our game for two weeks now and without telling us anything. We have no idea when it will appear in the Apple Store. But when it does, we promise to let you know immediately! The Android version is suffering from the typical “way too many different versions of Android” syndrome, but is making progress. Here, too, we’ll tell you right away. Update? Already? Yes, we plan to release an updated version of the game very soon with several improvements: Language selection option in the control panel. The game currently uses your operating system’s language setting. We’re going to let you decide what language you prefer. Two new languages: Polish and Russian. Scoring: We're implementing scoring because so many of you miss it – and because you need to know just how much of the game you did NOT see! Facebook and Twitter updates: But only if you want to! A few little bug fixes that we missed. Tech Support Forum We have created a Tech Support forum at <url>’re a bunch of Windows people here at Replay Games and neither Linux nor Mac is our strong suit. Tell Us How We Did We’ve created a Customer Service form at <url>’re having, and/or if you’re having troubles with the game. As you can imagine, we're swamped, but we’re trying our best to help everyone. We'd appreciate it if you'd help us by pointing others to the form, too. It's all about helping Larry have a great release! Reddit AMA Al Lowe will do another Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything) on Saturday, July 6th, at 1:00 p.m. EDT. Join us as we discuss making Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded and the whole Kickstarter experience. Our AMA is at <url>’s been a crazy week around here Al and Britton An important update to the update we just posted! Steam has informed us that, since they would prefer that there actually be humans in their offices when a new game is released, the game will NOT be going live on Steam until 10:00am PDT tomorrow. However, the games will still be available on the Replay Games website as of midnight tonight PDT. Josh Hi, Larryettes! Yes, it’s the one you’ve been waiting for. We’re releasing Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded to the public at 11:59pm PDT TONIGHT ! FIRST THINGS FIRST Tonight we’re releasing versions for PC, Mac, and Linux, via both Steam and the Replay website. We expect Apple to make the iOS version available tonight as well, but the timing is up to them. The Android version will be along soon. Despite all of us pulling for him as hard as we could, not even Larry could achieve that big a “simultaneous release.” NEXT THINGS NEXT Even if you played the beta build of this game, you have no IDEA how much has been changed. The amount of polish that N-Fusion’s been able to add in the past month is simply phenomenal. There is more of everything : animation, sound effects, voices, gags, ambience. Every menu in the game has been lovingly redone. The interface has been significantly improved in the mobile versions. I think you beta testers, especially, will be amazed at how beautifully Larry cleans up for his big unveiling. REWARD THINGS NEXT If you are a Backer who receives a digital copy of the game as a reward: Please note that you may choose between the PC, Mac, and Linux versions of the game as your digital copy. All three will be available either through Steam or through Replay’s site, <url>’ll want to get it from Replay Games. I’M NOW TURNING THE MIC OVER TO BRITTON MATHEWS. Hey Everyone! Britton here! I have put together a quick guide on how to create your account through our backer's portal. Quick Guide Here Once your account has been created, all your rewards will be associated to your account, giving you access to them. Please read the guide entirely before asking questions. Many key topics are covered. Most of our $40+ backers have already completed this step over the last year. I urge anyone who has already filled out this portal and is receiving physical rewards to double check your shipping address. We will begin shipping soon and this is the perfect time to verify or update your shipping address. On a completely unrelated note; almost a year ago Justin (Irishmile) submitted a design for a Kickstarter backer shirt that we unfortunately did not use. I never forgot about his design because I loved it so much. After much talk with our shirt printer and Justin, we decided we couldn't let his design fall by the wayside. Here is the final revision. The design went back and forth between Al and Josh many times to get everything just right. There was much discussion over the medal, proportionality and colors. It was a very fun discussion to be a part of. We have decided to sell this awesome shirt on our store. If you love it as much as we do, you can get it here . A very important note on the shirt. Due to the massive shipping effort we are about to undertake for the Kickstarter rewards, you will have to wait till after our physical rewards have gone out before we can begin shipping this shirt. All my focus at this point is getting the rewards sent out. The rewards are hilarious. The condom is by far my favorite and I can't wait for you guys to see them. LAST THINGS LAST This is it, kids! You’re about to see the culmination of over a year’s worth of work by an astoundingly talented group of people. I shouldn’t say this, because I’m biased, but I think this the *best* Leisure Suit Larry game that’s ever been released (and I know that some of the Leisure Suit Larry 7 contingent will contest that claim). And the incredibly cool thing about it is: you were all truly a part of it. We listened to your suggestions and requests. We took a lot of them into account. Some of you will be able to look at various aspects of the game and say, “That was MY idea!” How friggin’ cool is THAT? See you at midnight! Josh Hi ya, Kickstarters! Al Lowe here. It looks like we are EXTREMELY close to the finish line! And it appears that Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded will be the first Kickstarted game to ship! N-Fusion hasn’t wasted the last few weeks; they’ve made improvements to the game everywhere. I can’t wait for you to see it. While I’m proud we did the right thing and waited to ship until all the bugs were exterminated, we did much, much more: hundreds of new sound effects, redesigned menus with new artwork, user interface improvements, and even additional voiceovers. This truly is the best Larry game we can bring you. And our mutual wait is almost over! E3 Action Paul Trowe and I spent last week at E3 in Los Angeles and had a blast. We had loads of interviews with the foreign press. (U.S. press coverage was handled earlier, at GDC.) Even though Replay didn’t have a booth (a nice one would only cost all the money we raised on Kickstarter!), Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded was on display in several other booths. Reports were universally positive, as was the response from the press who’ve seen it. So far, so good. E3 week began with a bang: on Monday night, Paul and I joined Austin Wintory and Melora Hardin at Typhoon (a Santa Monica restaurant and jazz spot) for gig by the Late Night Jazz Orchestra . Wow, what a band! I knew they were good players after watching them record our soundtrack and this night cemented that reputation. But the highlight for us Larryites came in their second set when they played several of the cuts from the Larry OST. Melora sang her song from the game while Austin accompanied. She looked as good as she sounds! I just happened to have a saxophone mouthpiece in my pocket (heh, heh) so I borrowed a sax and played the Leisure Suit Larry Theme Song with them. They even gave me an opening cadenza. It was a musical highlight that I won’t soon forget! If your Kickstarter reward level includes a download of the original soundtrack and you haven’t grabbed it yet, what are you waiting for? Press Previews We’ve received scores of previews from gaming sites since the beta was released and they’ve been nearly unanimous in their praise. We’re (almost) blushing! Here’s one from yesterday on Destructoid . I’m hoping the actual reviews will be as sweet. Another Game to Kickstart Josh sends along news of another adventure game with a Kickstarter campaign: The St. Christopher’s School Lockdown . It’s an homage to the Sierra and Lucasarts games we love and they need your help. Josh says, “I’m incredibly impressed by their art style, by the fascinating political theme of the story, by their extremely well thought-out plan for the series, and by the team of individuals who are working on the game. PLEASE go over to their Kickstarter site and show your support for the game and, if you can’t see your way through to supporting it monetarily, just helping spread the word would, I’m sure, be of inestimable benefit to their project.” Well said, Josh! Wrap-Up Once the game goes live, you’ll want to download it but remember: you have to register first. Watch for another update from Britton with instructions on what to do, how, and when. Of course, game discs take time to be pressed and assembled, and some of the physical rewards need to be autographed, so those won’t ship for a few more weeks. (What? Game discs don’t burn themselves?) So please have patience. We promise: we’re working as fast as we can to speed your items to you! It’s been a fun year for me and I mean this sincerely: we literally could not have done it without you! Thank you so much for your faith in us (and Larry). As Larry would say, “It won’t be long now!” When Al, Josh and Paul first called me about scoring LSL I was rather speechless, and truthfully I still am. The Sierra adventure games were a huge part of my life back in the day, and so this gave me the chance to explore something real personally meaningful. And on top of that was the chance to work with an amazing big band: the Late Night Jazz Orchestra. Wait until to you hear these guys! Actually, don't wait. Watch this: <url>"No, in fact I'd be disappointed if you did anything other than what YOU want to do." So what you hear is equal parts silly, grimy, and rather naively romantic. That last aspect in particular was of fun ... I became sort of obsessed with trying to make Larry feel almost like this idealistic romantic guy, and not some sleazeball, so hopefully you'll feel a genuine, earnest romance in the music too (which of course ends up being rather hilarious when you pair that with some of the dialogue these guys wrote). To cap it all off, Josh and I collaborated on an original song called "Tiers of Joy," which was sung by the amazing, incredible Melora Hardin (who you probably didn't realize was a singer; she played Jan Levinson on NBC's "The Office!"). She even sang it live with the band, not as an overdub the way it's normally done these days. I'll be posting a video of that soon too. All told I couldn't be more excited about this game and soundtrack. Coming off of experiences like JOURNEY and MONACO, this was the most wonderful opportunity to try something totally new. I hope you enjoy the music and the performances by these absolutely stellar musicians. And I am so grateful to Al, Replay and N-Fusion for the wonderful partnership, and above all to YOU the backers for making all of this possible. The OST (Original Soundtrack) will be coming to Kickstarter backers relative to their giving level, and for everyone else you can check it out here: <url>’ve been sending you a lot of Kickstarter updates so far and for that, I want to first apologize. We’re nearing the end of the project, and we want to keep you up to date with the information as soon as it hits our desk. This is in an effort to be as transparent as possible while creating what we hope is the single best Leisure Suit Larry project in the entire history of the franchise. I want to start off by thanking our 4k+ beta testers who have uncovered more GREAT bugs than any internal or external QA department I’ve ever worked with in my entire career. This is largely in part due to the amazing work of QA Manager Jeroen Dekkers, and lead testers Tom King, Justin McMenamin, &amp; badass “woman in gaming superstar” Serena Nelson. Without each and every tester, Lead Tester, and QA Manager, the game would not be getting all the fixes you’ve found and continue to find. Here’s the problem, and thus this unscehdule Kickstarter update: due to the pure number of bugs found in the PC version alone (Mac version is being tested now,but not via Steam), we’re having to delay the game, yet again, until the end of June. I can’t tell you how many phone calls, arguments, and heart breaking conversations I’ve had with my advisors on this. I SERIOUSLY wanted this game out by the end of May because we’ve postponed it more times than Larry’s been rejected. Ok, well, maybe not THAT many, but still….we’ve had some delays. I want you to know this decision was not made lightly, and I’ve consulted with advisors inside the company and outside the company…with Al, Josh, distributors, our QA Manager, testers, marketing people, “stake holders,” board of directors, etc. The bottom line is, it’s just not ready for prime time. Sure, we COULD release the game at the end of the month, but we’d be shipping it with bugs. Things like: the wrong line being spoken, Larry walking through a table in the cabaret, missing sound effects in the tutorial, no music in certain spots, and Larry’s scaling needing fine-tuning. While some of these may seem trivial, we have ONE SHOT at getting this game right, and it will set the bar for quality for all future Larry games to come. The first one to bring up the suggestion of delaying the game was Josh on Thursday of last week. We’ve fought, laughed, cried, and argued over what to do for two full days and came to the conclusion you’re reading now. Josh offered to write this update to you since it was his original idea, but I told him “the buck stops here” and it was ultimately my call, and my responsibility to tell you and the rest of the world. I am not proud of this decision, but -- and please trust me when I tell you this -- having considered every single possible outcome, I’ve come to the conclusion that we need to give N-Fusion one more month to finish the game. There’s a good possibility that we MIGHT be done before that, but we want to give the game enough time to fix ALL the bugs, and put as much polish on it as possible. Nobody is holding a gun to our head and saying “YOU NEED TO RELEASE THE GAME FOR CHRISTMAS” or anything like that. I’ve always said “we’ll ship it when it’s ready,” and it’s simply not ready (as much as I wish it were….trust me). I’m sure there will be community backlash and I’m sure I’ll get more hate mail because of this, but please understand, this really is the best thing for the game, for Larry, for future versions of Larry, and for you, the person who took a HUGE risk on us in hopes we’ll deliver to you what you firmly believed to be the game we’re making. I’m sincerely sorry and I hope this decision is the correct one. Thank you for reading, and I hope you understand. From my heart, Paul If you pledged at the $75 level or above, this update is for you. If it’s not, forgive the intrusion. Next time, maybe? Hello, Larryettes, and welcome to the great Leisure Suit Larry 1 Kickstarter Beta! Let’s take care of some necessary paperwork. First I need to inform you that the keys are for the PC build *only* tonight. First Paul, then me, then N-Fusion spent all of last night and all day today trying to get the builds uploaded to Steam, but it’s a very strange and complicated process, and no matter who tried it, there were timeouts and multiple other issues. Sending the Mac version is even more complicated than sending the PC version, so N-Fusion is working on that (they are amazingly patient people), but it will probably be a few days before the Mac beta build is up and available. Hey, welcome to the never-dull world of game development. We love and want only the best for our Mac users, and the delay is unavoidable. Hopefully, it will be a very short one. Second, and almost as important: If you have the LSL:R alpha version already installed: You probably have noticed that Steam is already updating your version of the game. Unfortunately, Steam will not uninstall the alpha version before installing the beta version. This is not what we want . To ensure that you’re getting the beta and only the beta, you need to uninstall the game completely from your system. Delete the folder that contained the game, just in case your uninstall process didn’t get every last file. We don’t want any junk files left over that might result in “false” bugs. Only after you’ve uninstalled the game should you log back into Steam and reinstall the game. If you do NOT have the LSL:R alpha version installed, and/or if you have never gotten your key: You will need to go to the ReplayGamesInc.com website and log in so that you can get your Steam key. Then you can proceed directly to Steam and download the game. Now, on to the bug reporting guidelines and procedures. There are literally thousands of you beta testers, and just a handful of us whose job it is to sift through the bug reports, organize them, assess their severity, and get them to the dev team. So we’re trying to streamline this by doing what we need to do to avoid duplicating bugs. First: what is a bug? For the purposes of this beta test, a bug is a mismatch between the way the game is clearly supposed to work and the way it actually does work, and which can be reproduced. Examples of bugs: Larry’s mouth doesn’t move when he TALKs to the Clerk. When you LOOK at Larry’s wallet in inventory, it disappears. When talking to Fawn in her close-up, she suddenly becomes Jasmine. Again, you have to be able to reproduce a bug. If you can’t reproduce it, don’t report it…unless/until you figure out how to dependably reproduce it. Irreproducible bugs are the equivalent of telling a car mechanic, “My Volvo makes a little whirring noise about once every 500 miles, and usually I’m the only one who can hear it. Please get rid of that noise.” Examples of not bugs: I think the icons should be in alphabetical order. Faith has a straight Southern accent. Shouldn’t it be more Southeastern? You’re using THAT logo in the opening credits? Wrong, wrong, wrong! Don’t you guys ever learn? These are what we call “enhancements,” and we already have more ideas for enhancements than we can possibly use in a dozen bigger-budget remakes. But we can always use legitimate bugs. Second: How do I report a bug? Go to the Replay Games beta test forum . Check the KNOWN BUGS thread that’s pinned at the top of the Forum. Make sure your bug hasn’t already been reported! This is so important to keeping the beta test streamlined that I’m wriggling around in my seat just thinking about it. If the bug is already listed, there’s no need to report it. We’re on it. If the bug is NOT already listed, find the subforum that, in your best judgment, mostly closely corresponds to the bug you found: Installation, Animation, Sound, the translation of a particular foreign language (there are sections for each language), and so on. List the following information: A one-line description of what's happening; A brief summation of what you think should happen instead; The operating System you're running on: Windows XP/ Windows 7 / Macintosh; The screen resolution you’re running in; Steps needed to reproduce. That’s it! If we need more information in order to tackle the bug, we’ll contact you! Now…head over to the Replay Games website and grab your keys! Last one to post an authentic translation bug in the “Polish Language” subforum is a rotten egg! Josh &amp; Jeroen Good day, Larryettes. I’m making this very short since I just updated you a few days ago. The PC version of what we’re calling the “Kickstarter Beta” is being built as we speak. After that version’s built, the Mac version will follow later this evening. Both versions will be uploaded to Steam immediately. Don’t worry. There will still be a DRM-free version of the finished game available. The Steam requirement is for the beta only; we need to do what we can to keep the game from being pirated before it’s even out. Items uploaded to Steam take a number of hours to become available, so it will be tomorrow before you’ll be able to download your beta version. (Remember, only people who pledged at the $75 level or higher have access to pre-release versions of the game.) We’re also preparing a list of instructions and known issues. Definitely read ‘em over; this’ll save you both time and frustration down the line. Hold on to your hats, ladies and gentlemen. By this time tomorrow, the game should be on your hot little hard drive. All my love, Josh Happy Friday, Larryettes on this side of the International Dateline. Those of you who read all the way to the bottom of my last update may’ve read this line: “If all goes according to plan, you can expect the beta next week (week of May 6th)!” Well, we’re pretty much at the end of the week of May 6th, and those of you who pledged at the Alpha/Beta level (and above) haven’t received your beta invitation yet. (For those of you who are still wondering why you didn’t get an Alpha version: when we Kickstarted, access to the Alpha/Beta versions of the game came only with a pledge of $75 or more.) We’re now shooting for Monday, May 13th, to release the beta. We’ve had some interesting hiccups in the past couple of weeks…one of which was breaking Unity. (It seems that no Unity game has ever had more than about 3,000 lines of speech before, and we have about three times as many.) We also wanted to get *all* the final speech into the game before sending out the beta, and the last of the “pickups” was only recorded today. We’ll announce it here when the beta goes out. It will include French, Italian, German, and Spanish (“FIGS”), and we’re hoping for a Mac version as well for testing. If you’re one of our Beta testers, when you receive your email invitation, please be sure to read the materials very carefully. We will be looking strictly for *bugs* at this point, as opposed to suggestions for enhancements. (We’ve fielded and taken into consideration thousands of enhancement suggestions over the course of the project, especially after releasing the Alpha, but now it’s time to concentrate on finding and squashing bona fide bugs.) The instructions we send will tell you how to download the beta, where to report the bugs, and what format to follow in your bug reports. We’ll also be sure to tell you what bugs we already know about, so that you don’t waste time writing up a beautifully-crafted report for a bug we’ve already identified. So cross your fingers for a Monday release. We’re shooting hard for a May 31 ship date, so that should give us almost three weeks. We’re anticipating that’ll be doable, because the beta you’ll receive is going to be pretty darn clean. In other news: our Box Art contest on the Replay forums ended this past Wednesday, and we’re still debating the winner. Those of us who have hair (that disqualifies Al and me) are tearing it out trying to pick the best. We’ll have a decision for you next week. And in the meantime, just in case you haven’t seen her yet, here’s Larry’s new love interest, Jasmine, exactly as she’ll be seen in the game! Talk to you next week! Josh Greetings and salutations, Larryettes. Let’s keep this short and sweet, shall we? 1. Al Lowe has been in Berlin at the Quo Vadis conference, and gave a speech that was the runaway hit of the show! At least, that’s what Al said! 2. We’ve been sending the Collector’s Box art to various e-tailers who, although selling only a non-boxed digital version of the game, like to – or insist on – a mocked-up box for their websites. Since a lot of people have seen the Collector’s Box art and thought we shouldn’t be using it for marketing purposes, we’re going to start a contest (today or tomorrow) for all aspiring commercial artists. Details for the contest can – or shortly will be – available on the Replay forums, <url>’ll be able to find the exact rules, and you’re free to post your submissions on the forum for critique (although official entries will need to be sent directly to Replay per the rules you’ll find on the Contest subforum). 3. Al recently gave an interview, and in it, he’s quoted as saying that LSL2 might be out by Christmas. Don’t you believe it! We dispute the accuracy of that quote! LSL2 is a much bigger, more complex game than LSL1 , and work on LSL2 has scarcely begun. The interview must’ve taken place in Amsterdam, which might explain the author’s wishful thinking. I guess that’s it. Oh, right, one other thing: 4. If all goes according to plan, you can expect the beta next week (week of May 6th)! That’s right, IT’S COMING! OH, MY GOD, IT’S COMING! And on that note… Josh A gracious “good afternoon” to all you Larryettes. As we near the release of Leisure Suit Larry Reloaded, this update finds me a little wistful. We began our Kickstarter efforts on April 2nd, 2012; it’s just over a year later, and the end is well within sight. And to think that, within just a few weeks, these updates will no longer even be necessary. Today and tomorrow will be the final recording sessions for the game voices. That’s been a monumental task; with about 8,500 lines of dialogue and narration and 60 different characters, Al and I slogged through weeks of marathon sessions to get it all done. (Just about the only messages that won’t be voiced are the inventory-on-inventory responses, of which there are hundreds more, and the Blackjack/Slot Machine messages.) Most of the sessions consist of Al, Randy (our brilliant and incredibly detail-minded engineer/editor at Hamsterball Studios), the “talent,” and me, all on Skype. Al’s in Seattle, I’m in Albany, Randy’s in Austin, and most of the talent is in LA. The talent’s already gotten their scripts, as well as visuals of the character(s) they’re portraying. We go line-by-line, recording each one anywhere from once (if they nail it off the bat) to maybe a dozen times if necessary. What do we listen for? Well, sticking to the script is important. The game’s being translated into many different languages, so every time an actor improvises and we end up changing a line (because we like the improvised version better), there’s actually more time and money involved than simply changing the text to match the actor’s version. Beyond that, we’re listening for subtext and interpretation, pacing, consistency of accents and dialects, and “popped” p’s and b’s and other aural distortions. Al, Randy, and I all tend to catch different things with every single read, so naturally there are a lot of retakes. It’s also not unusual for Al or me to read the part of another character so that the actor whose voice we’re recording has something to react to. We frequently end up splicing – the beginning of one read and the end of another, for instance – to come up with the version we think sounds perfect. So it’s a lengthy process, and it can’t be rushed. But it’s punctuated with a lot of laughter and a lot of creativity all coming together in real-time. That keeps the energy and excitement up even when we’re doing inhumanly long sessions. Also in the next couple of days, N-Fusion will be putting in the very last of the animations. So with a couple of weeks’ worth of polish and internal testing, and plugging in all the speech, we’ll be ready for beta. And now, a surprise: a video, courtesy of Al Lowe. I won’t tell you what it’s about, but I do want to give credit where it’s due. Al conceptualized this video, directed *and* shot it himself, and edited it. (His daughter selected the music, “It's Time” by Imagine Dragons, <url>’ll see, none of it would’ve happened without the terrific team at www.darkhorseink.com , who have our gratitude for their hard work and perfectionism…the results of which many of you will be enjoying shortly. Without further adieu… <url>’s Game Developer Conference for you non-gaming industry Larryettes)!!!!!! Yes, you get to hear from me again. Two times in 30 days. What ARE the odds? I think I get picked to write the updates when there’s bad news since everybody else wants to stay in your good graces and at the “all hands” meeting today when Josh said “who wants to do the update this week?” I heard crickets. So, without further ado…. We actually have quite a few announcements to make with this update, so hang on to the seats of your pants: 1) It's absolutely official. Jan Rabson is returning as the voice of Leisure Suit Larry. He's been hard at work recording lines already, and he's as Larry as he ever was. You guys are going to love it. 2) Twin Galaxies has released their trading cards for 2013, and we're deeply moved to be among those honored. They have cards of Al, Josh, and even me this year. It's great to know that the work we're doing is being recognized by the only official video game trading card collection out there. Twin Galaxies has been around since the 1980’s honoring people like Billy Mitchell of Defender Hall of Fame, Warren Spector, and Richard Garriott, to name a few. To be honored with a Twin Galaxies trading card is like being inducted in to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. All three of us are extremely humbled and, because of this, will be immortalized forever in the history of the interactive entertainment industry (fancy shmancy for "video game industry"). If you want more information on this, Walter Day, the owner of Twin Galaxies, just posted on the Replay Games Facebook page about an art exhibit they're doing with all the cards ever made. Each card has a number and Walter only prints about 200 of each card. He asked Al, Josh, and I to sign 10 cards and send them back to him for his collection, the museum, etc. I still can't believe I get a card. I feel like Wayne in Wayne's World and kneeling to the tune of "I'm not worthy!!" 3) Speaking of recognition, I did a LOT of interviews at GDC last week, so expect to see news stories, video interviews, and hands on demos of Leisure Suit Larry all over the web. Some of the companies that interviewed with us were Touch Arcade, Game Zone, IGN, [a]listdaily, 148apps, Joystiq, Gamezebo, Slide to Play, Apples n Apps, Electronic Playground, the Escapist, EGM, Venture Beat, and more. Word about Larry is spreading fast you guys. The press is chomping at the bit for information about this project. That brings me to some bad news. 3) Now some of you who have been following the news stories about us may have already seen this, and I apologize for not telling you guys first. I just get so excited talking about this project that some information slipped out during interviews that I meant to tell you first, and I'm sorry for that. For those of you who missed it, here's what I let slip (and it wasn't on purpose, I swear to you, but when that camera is on you it’s like….well, odd is the only adjective I can think of). I almost went in to presidential debate mode but thank God they turned the camera off before that happened. So here’s the deal, we’re going to be late (again). That’s ok, I know you already hate me so a few more people sending me death threats is not going to kill me (no pun intended). Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded will come out at the end of May (at the earliest, and pending no disasters). It was a tough decision to make, but I've been in QA for 13 years of my life, and I do *not* want to ship a buggy product (but I’ll also say that NO piece of software is ever bug free, no matter how much it’s tested). We are not going to release anything until it's as good as it can be, and that means we need a little more time. This *will* affect the shipping of the Kickstarter rewards too, since a bunch of people are getting the collector’s edition box, signed stuff, etc. I know a delay is the last thing you wanted, but I promise you, no, I SWEAR to you, it will be worth waiting for. Also, I'm happy to announce that we're in pre-production of a free to play Larry casino game (obviously in ADDITION to a ReLoaded version of Larry 2 *or* a brand new Larry 8...we haven't made up our minds yet). This is NOT just a different version of Larry Reloaded, this will be a completely new Larry game that will be free to play. There aren't a lot of details I can share about it right now, because we're still trying to nail them all down, but we're doing it because we know you guys will love it when it's done. More deets when I have them. Since *none* of us has ever made, or been on a team, or shipped a Free-To-Play game before, we’re needing to bring in outside assistance to help in the design and daily maintenance of it. It’s what we call a “persistent world” experience, meaning the game is never “off”, so it’ll take some doing to get this thing right, but I am convinced we can do it. Know any good F2P designers? On a personal note, I know how passionate all of you guys are about this game, and I LOVE it. I am too. Bringing back Larry was a dream of mine, Al’s, and Josh’s, and I'm actually getting to make it a reality. That reality would not have been possible without you. We never forget that. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart, and I'll see you at Lefty's. -Paul p.s. Austin Wintory says hi!!!! p.p.s. I ran in to Cory &amp; Lori Cole, whom I got to work with while at Sierra (I was an Associate Producer on Quest For Glory: Dragonfire but after the hostile takeover I quit so I didn't get to ship the game but I *think* I'm in the credits), at GDC. They were sitting on couches doing interviews at the same time I was doing my demos for the press. After mine were done I had to go over and give them a big hug (I'm famous for my hugs, BTW) and take a picture with my old friends (and share some good old Sierra stories). Here's the picture Eli from Touch Arcade took. A few of you may be aware of who I am, but I’m willing to guess most of you aren’t. Thus far I’ve mostly kept to the background of the project. Quietly doing my job, and rarely tooting my own horn. But as we approach the release of the Beta build of Leisure Suit Larry Reloaded, I’ve decided it’s time to step forward and properly introduce myself. My name is Jeff Hillary, and I’m the Community Manager for Replay Games. What this means is 90% of the time you’ve read or posted to our Facebook or Twitter, it’s me you’ve been dealing with. My job is to keep you guys informed, and hopefully entertained as well. In addition, I surf through the forums, read your messages and tweets, and pass along your questions and ideas to other people in the company. I also receive and post fan-art, and a myriad of other tasks. Hopefully those of you I’ve interacted with have found this a pleasurable process, or at least a relatively pain-free one. If you have a moment, I’d like to tell you how I got this job, and more important to you, my personal private thoughts on the upcoming game. I was a Sierra kid. Oh Lucasarts was great, but I didn’t discover those games until my later teens. For me, it was Sierra all the way. Gabriel Knight is still one of my all-time favorite game series. And nothing tickles my funny bone quite like Leisure Suit Larry. Like many of you, I had my heart broken by Magna Cum Laude. Then the pieces were spit on and burned by Box Office Bust. I spent years waiting for the Larry 8 I was promised… to no avail. As the years went by, I would occasionally search for news of a new Quest for Glory, or King’s Quest, or Larry. Only to find that even the fan sites for these things were drying up and withering away. And then last year I heard about the Kickstarter campaign. I think my reaction was the same as many of you. “I DON’T WANT A REMAKE! I want a new Larry game by Al Lowe. And I especially don’t want a remake of Larry 1, I’ve already got TWO versions of that game!” But it had Al and Josh’s name on it, so I was willing to pledge what little I could. After all, after Box Office Bust, how much more damage could they do? When it not only succeeded, but reached the stretch goal that offered us new content, and a NEW GIRL, I actually started getting excited. Sure it was still a remake, but there’d at least be a couple minutes of new content right? That’s the most new Sierra content I’ve seen in a decade. That’s when I decided to put together a little fan video, just for fun. It gave me an excuse to go back through all of the games again, and capture the images I wanted. That done, I put together a video montage of all of the Ladies of Larry. On a whim, I sent a link to Paul Trowe, the CEO of Replay Games, and offered to help the project in any way I could. I didn’t honestly expect a response, but I lived in the same city as the company, so who knew? Paul brought me in, and offered to let me try being Community Manager for a bit. I think the idea was that if I was a complete failure, they could easily just kick me out…hell, they still might. Now, I’ve told you this long boring story, to let you know where I’m coming from. I am a fan. Go back and read that sentence again, but picture it voiced by James Earl Jones, with just a bit of echo. As a member of this company, I’m expected to say things like “Oh, so the new artwork for Fawn is in. How does it look?” But inside I’m just screaming “LEMME SEE LEMME SEE LEMME SEE!” When we get in a sample of one of the Kickstarter prizes, I’m supposed to say “Yes, I think the fans will like that” when all I’m thinking is “Can I have one of those? PLEASE?” In all honesty, I’m just one of you guys who managed to somehow sneak inside the process. So speaking to you, as one fan to another, I just wanted to say that you guys are seriously going to love this game. I wasn’t asked to write a letter like this, I volunteered, because I felt it needed to be said. There are so many things going into this game that you guys don’t know about yet (and I’ve been threatened with defenestration if I share anything I’m not supposed to). But trust me when I say that this game is not what some of us feared it would be. This is not a quick attempt to cash in on the heritage of a long running adventure game franchise. This game is a labor of love, from people who sincerely want to bring back what we consider to be a classic icon of gaming. Every line of dialogue, every description, has been rewritten FROM SCRATCH by Josh and Al. The new artwork is an amazing blend of modern HD technology and Larry’s classic (lack of) sensibilities. They’ve changed around a lot of the puzzles. They’ve added new rooms, added a bevy of new items and new puzzles, they even added in branching dialogue with the ladies. Nothing about this process involved cutting corners to save a buck or two. When they wanted music, they got a Grammy nominated composer. Half measures have no place at Replay Games. Like I said, when I first found out about this project, I wasn’t thrilled about another remake. But this is so much more than that. This is a reboot of the Larry franchise. Actually imagine for a minute playing through the whole Larry series without the DRASTIC changes in visual style and technology. Imagine watching Larry grow older and pudgier as his adventures occur. Imagine a version of Larry 2 that isn’t horrifically plagued by dead-ends because you didn’t pick up an item three hours ago. And then imagine the new games we could make. Imagine the other franchises we could try to bring back to life. Imagine the new franchises we could create. Imagine a new era of adventure gaming. Are you imagining all this stuff? Because I promise you everyone in this company is. I don’t know if Paul wants me to share this, because it might hurt our image as an money obsessed, fan trampling video game company, but making money has never been the first priority of this project. Every step of the way, the only concern I’ve ever seen is delivering the best possible game to the fans. Let me tell you, as a fan, as one of you, I’m incredibly excited. And as the Community Manager of Repay Games, I can’t wait to share this game with you. Thank you all for your time. And especially thank you for all of your love and support. I hope to see you on our Facebook pages, or on our forums, or our twitter feeds. Jeff Hillary – Community Manager (Super Fan) Replay Games: <url>’t tried out Fester Mudd yet, you really should. It’s a game that blends Monkey Island and Freddy Pharkas into one giant vat of fun. It’ll hold you over until you manage to get your hot little hands on Larry. Fester Mudd: <url>"How to Play" pseudo-tutorial may change, that's still being finalized. But the narration and dialogue are complete as of last week!) All of Austin Wintory's amazing music? DONE AND RECORDED! (However, at Austin's request, the *final* versions of the music will NOT be in the public Beta version; we're holding it back 'til release, just so that even the Beta testers will have some terrific surprises.) All the backgrounds? Almost done. Two left to go! Voices? Recording this week! (And probably next.) The Art book? DONE and at the printer! (This is truly magnificent.) The Box? DONE and at the printer! The Stripper Pens? DONE and in manufacture! Kickstarter T-shirts? DONE! Lubbers? Playing cards? Coasters? Casino chips? Breath spray? Shot glasses? All DONE and in the Replay offices! Huge, beautiful lithographs? DONE and in the Replay offices! The Beta? Still at least a couple of weeks off. We're waiting 'til all the final animations are in, all the voices are in, and as many obvious bugs as possible have been squished. We want to make the Beta as clean as possible before we send it out; we don't want to have to include a list of "Still to come" items. Yes, we are being disgustingly productive. Eat our dust! Stay tuned. We've got another update coming in a couple of days. Squeezes, Josh P.S. I want to mention to all the Sierra lovers in the crowd (and I assume that's most of us, if not all) that there's another Sierra-style Kickstarter in progress. This one is from Himalaya Studios. You may not have heard of Himalaya, but their core group were formerly known as AGD Interactive LLC, the people responsible for the commercial-quality fan remakes of King's Quest I, King's Quest II, King's Quest III, and Quest for Glory II. They've only got a few days to go...show 'em the love! They're at <url>’s the link to the event: <url>’ll need to get a ticket with Stageit, using their currency (“Notes”). These Notes are used to “tip” the performers, but the amount of the tip is totally up to you...you can even tip 0 notes and still get a ticket (although we hope you’ll consider more). But you do need to have some Notes on account at Stageit, so if you’ve never used Stageit before, you’ll need to buy a minimum number of Notes – 50 at $5.00 – to qualify to get a ticket to the event. As an added bonus: if you’re one of the top 3 tippers, Austin will mail you a conductor score from the session , signed by himself, Al Lowe, and Melora Hardin. Melora, who portrays Jan Levinson on The Office , is the singer who will be recording the song that Austin and I wrote for the game. Yes, you may end up hearing that song during the session! Following the recording, Austin, Melora, and Al Lowe will sit down for a 20-minute chat with the audience. So please join us on Monday, March 11th, for this one-of-a-kind event. We now return to your regularly-scheduled anticipation of Leisure Suit Larry Reloaded . Hello loyal Leisure Suit Larry fans!! I speak for everybody at Replay and N-Fusion when I say we absolutely loved your comments to the Alpha version of Larry. As a game developer / publisher, you never know how the game is going to do until you release it to the public. No matter how many reviews are out there, beauty is always in the eye of the beholder and you guys have made us more than happy. Well, a better word for it, IMO, would be ecstatic. We are THIS CLOSE (imagine my fingers being spread one inch apart) to releasing the beta. We’re putting the polish on all the characters, backgrounds, recording the voices, and Austin Wintory, composer extraordinaire, is working with our very own Josh Mandel on a song for the Cabaret. We think you guys are really going to like it. Josh played a scratch track for me on the phone over the weekend (yes, we’re working every single day at this point) and it sounds absolutely incredible! I hope every single one of you dig it as much as we do. So, in regards to development, besides what I listed above, there’s not too much else going on. I can, however, say that some of the girls close ups are finalized and they are looking GOOD (well, except for the girl above Lefty’s bar, that is). The music is being recorded live in Los Angeles next week and Al is flying down to oversee everything. In addition, I personally convinced Al to do a sax solo to the Leisure Suit Larry theme on the OST (official sound track) of the game. If you purchased this tier you are going to be STOKED!! If you didn’t, well, you can always buy it afterwards. I asked him to do this since seeing him play at Video Games Live at E3 last year. He had the stage all to himself and the crowd went WILD when Tommy Tellarico announced Al Lowe was coming on stage. The performance was so good, that I absolutely had to make sure we had a duplicate of that on the OST. Don’t get me wrong, the big band recording of the theme is AWESOME, but after all, this is THE Al Lowe, here, and hearing him play the solo was just awe-inspiring. Before I let you go, I just wanted to let you guys know that, in the meantime, while Larry is in development, we've intentionally signed an AMAZING adventure game to publish to tide you guys over until you get to play the full version of Leisure Suit Larry. It’s called Fester Mudd: The Curse Of The Gold. When Al, Josh, and I evaluated this game we immediately knew it would be a hit with our audience. We’re first releasing it on PC, Mac, and Linux and in a few weeks we’ll be putting it out on all iOS and Android devices. I love point &amp; click adventure games on the PC mainly but found myself in love both the iPad and PC versions for 2 totally different reasons. You’ll know when you pick it up. We’re keeping the price intentionally low so you guys won’t have to shell out a fortune to get a great game before Larry goes gold master. Oh, I forgot to tell you!! You guys are the first ones hearing about the release date. We’re sending out a press release tomorrow announcing where people can buy it but obviously we prefer if you buy it directly from our store (launching tomorrow on replaygamesinc.com) instead. That way, 100% of the revenue goes to us and Prank instead of any of the numerous distribution partners we have set up for it. And if you like to collect nostalgia, we’ll be releasing a retail version worldwide in about a month. In the meantime, keep holding your breath because you’re about to get some amazing stuff. And rest assured, we will not release a half-assed, bug-ridden game. We’re going to test, polish, test, polish until it’s perfect. AND we don’t think it’s going to affect our release date, which is extremely cool. Take care, and speak to you guys soon. If you want to ask me any questions directly just hit me up in email or on Twitter. -Paul p.s. You’ll be pleased to know that *most* of the Kickstarter items are in and we’re flying Al down from Seattle to personally sign the items we promised in our Kickstarter (and, of course, help assemble the boxes…but don’t tell him I told you that….he doesn’t know we’re going to make him sweat when he gets to Austin). Happy Monday Holiday again, faithful Larry backers! It’s been an incredibly eventful couple of weeks. I’m referring, of course, to the release of the alpha version four days ago. I think it’s safe to say that there wasn’t an individual at Replay or N-Fusion who wasn’t as nervous as hell about this. Alpha versions are not intended for viewing by the general public, and for good reason. We don’t want people rushing to judgment about the final product based on programming, art, music, sound, and text that are incomplete. Speaking only for myself here (although I’m sure I’m not alone), I was fairly certain that we would be inundated with emails asking us about features, puzzles, scenes, and characters that aren’t in the alpha. Instead, the response blew us all away. The vast majority of commenters clearly had no trouble understanding the concept of an alpha, and, better yet, were overwhelmingly supportive of our efforts. That’s not to say there aren’t issues people have brought up, and we’re listening to them. But most of all, I think the alpha has proven something to that small, vocal contingent who’ve been doubting that we were serious about bringing Sierra On-Line gameplay, and Larry in particular, back to life. We know the job is far from over. None of the music you heard is final. Some of the backgrounds you saw aren’t final, including the close-ups of Eve, Jasmine, Faith, and Fawn. There are literally thousands of lines of text and dialogue that aren’t plugged in. There are many characters you haven’t seen at all yet, dozens of animations yet to come, and a lot of fixing and tweaking of stuff that is there. Then there are the voices. So there’s still a lot of heavy lifting still in front of us, but now the world knows that we were serious when we said that Larry will Live Again. In other news… The various Backer rewards are all in progress; some are actually finished and in the Replay offices. Here’s a shot that Britton Mathews found of the silkscreens for the exclusive Larry t-shirt. As I’ve mentioned before, the Backer rewards will all go out at the same time, at the end of the game’s production. We need to wait until all the artwork is finalized, because some rewards, such as the calendar and the art books, require finalized artwork. We had an interesting little hiccup in the Breath Spray production a couple of weeks ago: on the label, we had text that included the words “Contains industrial-strength breath spray.” The company that produces the custom-printed spray contacted Kevin Kettler and said, “The FDA is refusing to allow us to put that on the label.” So we did a rewrite, but Kevin pointed out that while Larry has been rejected by many women over the years, this is the first time he was actually rejected by the government as well! By the time I speak to you again, we’ll be startlingly close to beta. So hang on. The best is yet to come. One last tidbit before I turn back to my spreadsheets. Al recorded Larry’s Theme with his MOJO Big Band just a few days ago, and although we don’t have a final mix for you yet, we thought you might enjoy it. Here it is. <url>’s probably one of the guys in the studio goofing off. After all, if we don’t have fun at work, what’s the point, right? Anyway, I know you guys haven’t seen anything from me in a while but I pressed the team REALLY hard to get this to you guys tonight. I hope you have as much fun playing it as we've had building it. We’d love to hear what you guys think, not only on our forums , but also on the TellTale forums as well as Adventuregamers.net , or wherever else you’d like to brag about being one of only 2,200 people in the world that gets to play the game this early. Josh wrote a TON of dialogue for the game so, for fun, trying talking to, licking, unzipping your fly, and doing things you wouldn't ordinarily do. We all hope you get a laugh or two, especially out loud (LOL). (Josh tells me that the vast majority of the text isn't even in the game yet, so if you get generics like “It isn't much to look at,” that’s placeholder stuff and there’s thousands more messages already in the pipeline.) Your Steam key will be in an email that you should be receiving shortly. Unfortunately, this build is for PC only. It was the only way to get you guys something today and I had to personally make the call. I apologize to all of our Mac and Linux users out there. The Beta will have Mac support for sure and *hopefully* Linux support. Don't worry about how Larry looks or walks. None of that is final. His walk cycle and shading are some of the polish we plan on doing for Beta. Yes, we're aware he moon walks. :) From all of us at Replay, -Paul Trowe p.s. none of us are going to get any sleep tonight because we can't wait to see what you guys think!!! In other words, this is our 50th Kickstarter update Hi, ya, KSers! It’s me, Al Lowe, back again with another huge bunch of news for our thousands of favorite people in the whole world! (But not everyone. You. Over there. Yeah, you! The person not reading this. You’re no favorite. But all the rest of you are!) It’s been a busy few weeks here at Larryton Abbey, so let’s get right to the deets! Alpha release scheduled Those of you who qualified for the Alpha release of the game get the first big news: right now, we think our Alpha version will be ready for download on February 16 , yes, a mere dozen days from right now! You’ll receive complete details via a Britton Mathews magic email, but I don’t think he’ll mind me letting it slip that it’s going to be a download from Steam . Now remember: this is an Alpha and (like making laws and sausages) it ain’t pretty, but rejoice in the knowledge that you’re going to get the very first look at Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded of anyone outside of us inside the Larry Compound. Sure, the game is buggy; in fact, it’s so buggy we not going to accept bug reports from you. Nope, all you get to do is enjoy it! No responsibilities. How Larryish! Beta testers, be patient. You won’t get off so easy; from you, we’re going to expect lots of bug reports. But when the beta release will be, we’re not sure — but it won’t be long from now! Achievement and Points We’re in the process of implementing a new Achievement system for the game. While all of my games used Points to indicate your progress (as will this new version), now you’ll be able to share your progress with your friends via Achievements. I can’t tell you much about it, but just think what Achievements from Josh Mandel (and me) could look like. Ah, the implications! The double entendres! The embarrassment! Music You know how I feel about game music in general and how much of it is weak. But not Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded! Every weekly update we get from Austin Wintory confirms in my mind what a ge-nius he is — and what a lucky slob I am for being able to land him for our project! I’m so delighted to hear what he’s doing with my humble little Larry theme song. He’s treating it as a leitmotif that you’ll hear throughout the game, subtly weaving it into a tapestry of beautiful colors that capture the emotion of the various scenes perfectly. And yes, I’m still talking about Leisure Suit Larry. Box Art I’ve seen the first drafts of the commemorative box artwork and I love it. You will, too! Talk about a real collector’s item! It’s a masterpiece. This will blow you away. Logo The game’s logo is now finalized and here it is: Collectibles Speaking of artwork, we’ve also finalized the design for the Leisure Suit Larry playing cards, con-doms, cocktail napkins, shot glasses, poker chips, and other cool KS higher level rewards . At the risk of sounding like a broken record (wait; anachronistic), uh, dirty CD (nah; dated) repetitive download (hmm?), anyway, it’s some of the coolest stuff I’ve ever seen associated with a game. I can’t wait for you to see it. Which you will. Soon. But not too soon! Fester enters beta Fester Mudd: Curse of the Gold is currently in beta and will be rolled out to PC and Mac via a brand new platform on our very own website, as well as most other major portals worldwide. An-droid and iOS will follow soon after. Set aside some time to enjoy this one! More is worth a wait Because of all the cool things we’ve added to the game, our schedule has slipped …a little. We planned for a March release; unfortunately, we’re going to be a few days late. Let’s just say early April. Please consider this good news : by waiting just a little longer, you’re going to get the best game we can create! And isn’t that worth a little wait? Whew! I didn’t mean to wear out your scrolling finger with this update, but I’m so proud of the Replay and N-Fusion teams and the work they’re doing here at Laffer Manor that I just couldn’t stop bragging! Until next time, AL Happy Martin Luther King day, Larryettes. How is it that these updates always seem to fall on holidays? We’re working pretty furiously and starting to get very excited. I’m going to keep it very short this week and cover a few more questions we’ve been getting. The Alpha is coming! We are estimating two weeks ‘til the Alpha build. Linux. Yes, we are definitely coming out with a Linux version. It may not be “Day One,” but we’re doing it. We’re considering the degree to which we can use our Linux-friendly Kickstarter patrons as testers; obviously they will be helping us to some degree, but we also have to figure out how much professional testing it will require. Music is coming in fast and furious from Austin Wintory, and so far I’m adoring what I’m hearing…and that’s just the synth versions. It’s all going to be recorded with live instruments before it goes in the game. Austin and I are also working on a little surprise. Say no more. The backgrounds are almost all done; the only remaining ones are a couple locations in the Casino, and the close-ups of Fawn, Faith, Jasmine, and Eve (which Colin is taking the most time with, seeing as how important they are to the game). The text, too, is almost done; all I have left to work on are those locations that don’t have backgrounds, plus the inventory-on-inventory (which won’t be voiced, so as long as it’s done in enough time for the translators, it’ll be easy to slip into the game). We won’t be able to afford foreign language voiceovers right out of the gate. But it’s on our “most wanted” list of additional features, should the game be popular enough to allow us to budget it as an add-on. Lastly, I want to alert all Sierra fans to a new upcoming Kickstarter project: ex-Sierra composer Ken Allen (who did some of Sierra’s greatest music) is producing an album, Under the Half Dome , based on music from his computer game composing career…from 1989 to 1996. (By the way, Ken is also doing the soundtrack for the Two Guys’ upcoming SpaceVenture .) The Kickstarter hasn’t begun quite yet, but I believe it’s scheduled for tomorrow , Tuesday, January 22nd! For the moment, you can follow it at www.kenspace.com (Ken’s project blog), or on his Facebook page at <url>’s fans (like me) and lovers of the best of Sierra’s golden years. Back to work! Teambox awaits! Josho Happy New Year, Larryettes! We are now officially in “crunch mode,” although, to be honest, everyone at N-Fusion and I have been in crunch mode all along. But now it’s official, which means a whole new shipment of caffeinated beverages, caffeinated candies, and caffeinated bacon. Before I go off on minutiae about game text, I’m going to answer a few questions I’ve seen around Kickstarter and the Replay Games fora: Yes, we’re still on track for a Q1 2013 release. Yes, we’re still planning on foreign language releases concurrent with the release of the English version: French, Italian, German, and Spanish (or “FIGS”). Yes, we’re still planning on PC, Mac, iOS, and Android versions. Linux is still a real possibility. Unity 4 makes porting it relatively easy. But it does involve whole additional testing cycles that aren’t in the budget (timewise or moneywise). The Kickstarter premiums will ship about the time the game ships. We may be able to push some of the digital items (like the HD wallpaper) out sooner, but our overriding goal is to meet our ship date, and it’s an all-out push with that singular goal in mind. For the physical goods, we don’t want to do more than one wave of shipments, because that will multiply our shipping costs dramatically. (In other words, we don’t want to, say, ship out the T-shirts separately from the Calendars, because that means hundreds of extra shipping containers and thousands of extra dollars in postage.) The front of the T-shirt hasn’t changed. The back of the T-shirt is now an N-Fusion-created Larry. Al and I would both have loved adding a parser, but that would’ve necessitated a monumental increase in both budget and development time. Okay, now here’s where I finally get to talk about the State of the Text. There are currently six basic actions for interacting with everything in Larry’s world: Look, Talk, Use, Taste/Smell, Zipper, and a generic “Inventory Item On” function (along with specialized inventory object on messages when appropriate). As I mentioned during the Kickstarter, I hate generic messages, but I can’t completely get around using them. Let me define a couple of terms. When I say “flag,” that’s a bit of programming that monitors the state of something in the game that we want to track. I’ll give you an example from the game. Under some conditions, the dog will come along and pee on Larry. After being peed on, I want the first person that Larry meets to comment on the unusual aroma. So there is a flag for Larry called “peedOn.” The vast majority of the time, this flag is off (peedOn==False). When the dog pees on him, the flag is changed (peedOn==True). Many of the characters have a line of dialogue to speak when they encounter Larry and peedOn==True. As soon as they deliver the line, the flag is changed again, back to False. And the cycle of life begins anew. Flags change constantly throughout the game. Simply looking at a screen feature can change a flag; this is relevant when I want to have a series of messages for something, with that message changing each time you look at the item. First time you look at something, second time you look at something, and so on. When I say “feature,” I mean a region of the screen that has its own identity and requires its own text text “handling.” For instance, look at the Come ‘n’ Go interior at :06 in the video we created for the Steam Greenlight effort. I identified 28 separate features (not counting Larry himself): the Hot Dog display, the floormat, the refrigerated case, the counter, the Clerk, and so on. The majority of rooms are not this busy, thankfully, or I’d be writing until 2013. Oh, wait, I am. So I create messages for each of the six basic actions for each of those 28 features. Assuming only one message per feature (although many have two or more), that’s 168 messages right there, before I even start to be able to get into all the specifics that are necessary to cover different flag settings. The specific messages for those features requiring different flag settings can easily double the total number of messages used in a room. That’s a vast amount of recording and editing, a vast amount of speech to put into a game (especially a mobile game!). And that’s before factoring in the inventory-object-on-inventory-object messages and dialogues between Larry and other characters. (Side note: I actually started with an experiment: seeing if I could create a couple of rooms where clicking every single inventory object on every single feature would have its own message. It turned out to be immensely time-consuming since there were more than 40 potential inventory items – although, of course, some objects don’t apply to some locations -- and dozens of features in each room. I stopped when I got close to 800 messages for the room, and that wasn’t even one of the more crowded rooms.) With these kinds of totals, I’ve pretty much ended up having to use some generics. For instance, if you try to talk to most inanimate objects, you’ll get a generic message (although it’s always at least unique to the room). And when you click an inventory item on a feature, you’ll get a generic message unless there’s a good reason – comedy and/or puzzle relevance – for a more specific one. Despite this, I think we’ll still have one of the most robust Larrys ever written in terms of sheer quantity and quality of input responses. And now, back to work I go. Lots to do. Not enough time in which to do it. Fondly, Josh I had planned to keep this update short; we’ve had four updates in December already. But then I remembered that I promised last time to go into some detail about my text process. But then I thought that if it were me receiving these updates, I’d say, “C’mon, Hanukkah ended last week, yesterday was Festivus, Kwanzaa’s in a couple of days, tonight’s Christmas Eve. Just cut to the goodies, please.” So I’m throwing caution to the wind and cutting to the goodies! Here are a half-dozen of Colin Merlo’s finished backgrounds for the game, complete and in all their high-res glory. You’ve seen them in the Greenlight video, but not like this! (Speaking of Greenlight, for those of you who upvoted Larry and Fester, THANK YOU! If you haven’t, we still need every vote we can get…instructions here ). The interior of Lefty’s! ( Hi-res version ) Lefty's Gorgeous Bathroom! ( High-res version ) The “Secret Room”! ( High-res version ) The “Come ‘n’ Go”! ( High-res version ) The Alley to the right of Lefty’s! ( High-res version ) Mugger Alley! ( High-res version ) Happy New Year, everyone! (Our High-res Holiday Card) See you next quarter! Josh Good morning! We were hoping to hold this back for a couple more days, but there was a Red Carpet interview at Spike TV’s Video Game Awards last week, and now the cat’s out of the bag. So we’re dropping this on you shortly before our official Press Release goes out: Our composer on Leisure Suit Larry Reloaded is Austin Wintory, Grammy-nominated, VGA-winning composer of the incredible soundtrack for Journey . It’s impossible to say who’s more excited by this: Al, Paul, me, or Austin himself. We’ve been working on this deal for months (I note that my very first email to Austin, introducing him to the project, was on August 8th), and we couldn’t possibly be more thrilled. Any game would be outrageously lucky to work with Austin, and our li’l Kickstarter Larry GOT HIM! Have a great day! Josh Good morning, Larryettes. There have been two extra Kickstarter updates since I last wrote, pertaining to the effort to get both Leisure Suit Larry and Fester Mudd approved via Steam Greenlight. If you haven’t voted for them, and you’re willing to do so, I’d take it as a great favor…especially with Fester Mudd , because that game’s lead designer, Paavo Harkonen, is a talent waiting to be celebrated, and it’s been a privilege for me to work on that game with him. As you probably know if you read the previous update or two, we’re having a contest, and five of the six prizes are pieces of original art from the game I did with Al back in ’93, Freddy Pharkas , Frontier Pharmacist . I want you to know that those pieces, original Freddy Pharkas talkers lovingly painted by ex-Sierra artist Ruben Huante, are near and dear to my heart. I’ve never made any of the Freddy artwork available before this year, I’ve been caring for them and showing them off for about 20 years now, and I think it’s time to spread some of the joy around. (If you haven’t voted yet to enter the contest, here are complete instructions .) The video that accompanied Kevin’s first update dropped eight full, complete backgrounds on you: Lefty’s Exterior Lefty’s Bathroom Lefty’s Secret Room The Come ‘n’ Go Interior The Alley right of Lefty’s (got that?) Mugger alley The Telephone close-up Lefty’s Video Gaming Terminal For those of you keeping track, that’s not nearly all the backgrounds that’ve been finished. Others include Lefty’s interior, Lefty’s hallway, Lefty’s upstairs, the exterior of the Come ‘n’ Go, the close-up of the Hooker, the Taxi, and the Video Gaming Terminal at the Wed ‘n’ Ready (the while-you-wait wedding chapel). You also got a taste of Larry’s animation and some of his “idle cycles,” the movements he makes randomly and habitually when you’re not telling him to do anything specific. We’re fully cognizant of the sliding issue with Larry’s walking. That’s a fine-tuning task that came standard with pretty much every Sierra adventure: matching the scale of the walker to the scale of the background. From a narration-and-dialogue standpoint, I’m still keeping up with artwork. I’m going to talk a lot more about my procedures and choices with the text next time, but since there’ve been so many updates in the past two weeks, I’m going to keep this one brief and give you something entirely different today: the video from N-Fusion that I’ve been talking about for so long. Now you’ll get to see a bit more of the process, put some faces to names, and so on. I love these people, and we’re lucky to have them working with us. They go above and beyond every damn day...weekends included. <url>…perhaps sooner than you think. Huggers, Josh Hello adventure gamers! We have two important announcements : 1. Leisure Suit Larry and Fester Mudd are now on Steam Greenlight. Purchase on Steam is not required, as we will have many digital distribution portals. A DRM FREE version will also be available on release. 2. By “upvoting” the games on Steam, you enter yourself into a contest to win one of six prizes! The latest Ultrabook on the Planet or one of five original pieces of artwork from Freddy Pharkas (They are the “talkers,” the close-up portraits used to animate the mouths). Ultrabook , Ultrabook Specs , Pharkas Talker 1 , Pharkas Talker 2 , Pharkas Talker 3 , Pharkas Talker 4 , Pharkas Talker 5 We need all the votes we can get to ensure these games make it onto steam! The contest will end when both games are Greenlit. Emails will be randomly picked for prizes, ONLY when both games are Greenlit. 1st name drawn gets first selection of the prizes (One prize per person). The second name gets second selection, and so on. HERE’S HOW TO WIN: 1. Login to your Steam account or create one here . 2. Go to the LSL and Fester Mudd pages located at these links: a. Leisure Suit Larry b. Fester Mudd 3. Click the box YES under: Would you buy this game if it were available in Steam? If you can’t click the checkmark, a favorite and your account name will be accepted. 4. Take screen shots that show the yes box/favorite checked, and your account name by pressing PrtScr (Print Screen), alt+PrtScn for multiple monitor setups, or command+shift+3 for Mac users.[This will take a screenshot and save to the desktop] Be sure that we can see your login/account name and the checked box/favorite in the same screenshot. [Note: If you can’t see your name and the check box in the same screen, press F11 to go full screen, then take the screen shot] 5.

Go to the Replay site contest form and submit the screenshots you saved to your computer. You will see a success confirmation. You will need to submit a screenshot for each game separately. Further support can be found at this Replay Forums Thread . If you have any questions, ask away!!! Kevin Kettler Replay Games Happy CyberMonday, Larryettes. (May I call you that?) Before I get into this week’s bits and pieces, I want to thank everyone who supported Corey and Lori Cole’s HERO-U Kickstarter project. Though they made it a nailbiter, they DID reach their goal, so the project is a big thumbs-up. In fact, projects from ex-Sierra designers have a 100% success rate on Kickstarter (Jane Jensen, the Coles, the Two Guys, and the Larry project)…and in the games category, the general success rate for funding is under 40%. We’re hoping that this fact isn’t lost on the major publishers. Now onto Larry news. We’ve got the additional final backgrounds for: Mugger's Alley Fire Escape Alley (Right side of Lefty's building) The Payphone closeup The Video Poker closeup The Come 'n' Go exterior Mugger’s Alley called for some clever thinking on Colin’s part. This alley actually appears in numerous places throughout the game, and we wanted to make sure that it matches up well with all its locations. In the best of all possible worlds, and with an unlimited budget, each alley would look completely different, but that’s neither practical nor really necessary, as you never get to spend more than a few seconds in these alleys. The Video Poker Machine will actually have several skins depending on where it appears, because we’re putting it in several places throughout the game. This is a departure from the game’s earlier incarnations, simply to reduce the number of cab rides that a player has to take. Speaking of departures from the original design, we’re also taking out the concept of death due to going broke. There will always be a way in the game to get a buck or two with which you can rebuild your funds (I’m not going to reveal that methodology; it will become apparent only when and if it’s needed). This is borne out of our feeling that running out of money should just be another obstacle to overcome, not a cause for death. That’s not to say we’re caving completely to current trends and removing death from the game. There are still many ways to die, but three that we’ve removed are: Going broke Bringing an alcoholic beverage into the taxicab Running out of time Many people might not remember (or might never have discovered) that the original Larry was timed, and you would die if dawn broke without your finding true love. But with our emphasis on being able to try vast numbers of actions, that naturally can add to exploration time, and it would be cruel to give people more opportunities for exploration and then punish them for taking advantage of those opportunities. In the original game, some deaths would result in Larry being taken to the “Larry Factory” underground. In the very first LSL1, it was an assembly line, and you could see other Sierra characters also waiting to be reassembled. In the VGA remake, it was more of a blender-and-mold affair. Our Larry Factory is neither of those; it’s a concept which I’ve actually hinted at obliquely many times throughout my updates. This new Larry Factory will return you to the exact point you were at in the game *before* you made your fatal error, so it’s as pain-free a death as possible. We are *this close* (making pinching gesture with fingers) to signing our composer, and if it hadn’t been for the usual Thanksgiving shutdown of everything in the United States except for retail sales, we’d probably have it by now. We’re so excited about this that I’m going to put out an extra Update as soon as we can release the info. Along with Windows and Mac builds, N-Fusion produced its first iOS build of the game last week. I had it up and running on an iPhone, and it’s absolutely beautiful. Jeff had it running on his iPad, and we were arguing on the phone about which looked cooler, and why. That’s the news for now. Take care, keep warm, don’t fight, and thanks again for your support, not just for our game, but for all the resurgent Sierra-related projects. Those of us who are anxiously watching the Sierra renaissance are looking forward to a truly memorable 2013. Hugs, Josh As we in the United States begin a season that focuses on gratitude, I’d like to wish everyone a happy Veteran’s Day. On the topic of gratitude: despite dire predictions, my immediate neighborhood was treated fairly gently by Hurricane Sandy. Both flooding and wind damage were minimal. (I had been preparing for something similar to the previous year’s Hurricane Irene, in which a creek backed up into our house and the sewer lines collapsed, resulting in a nightmarish and expensive mess.) As most of you probably know, though, Sandy devastated major portions of the East Coast, with an estimated 40,000 homes lost and some areas still – after almost two weeks – without electricity. Anything you can do to help right now would be great, but I’d especially like to point out that *blood* is a particularly useful gift that money can’t replace. So if you can see your way through to donating a pint, or double-red cells or plasma, that’s the kind of contribution that may prove just as valuable to an ill veteran as to an injured storm survivor. Our developer, N-Fusion, was right in the storm’s path in Northern New Jersey. Their power was out for a full week (from Monday, October 29th ‘til Sunday night, November 4th). Fortunately for our project, several of the team members had power at home and were able to continue working throughout the week. Today marks N-Fusion’s third milestone on the project, and, due to their extra commitment and push through this past week, it looks like they’re going to make it. I think I mentioned last time that Al’s choice for musician has been made. The contracts still aren’t signed yet – there’s a lot of negotiation involved because the musician is a monumentally hot industry talent, and we’re on a Kickstarter budget. So I’m still not at liberty to mention a name, but I will as soon as I'm cleared to do so. Colin has been cranking on the final background art, and both Al and I are completely in love with everything he’s been doing. At this point, the finals we have are: Lefty’s Exterior Lefty’s Interior Lefty’s Back Hallway Lefty’s Bathroom The “Secret Room” The Upstairs Room The Cab Every single one of these is an absolute gem. Al and I were both doing virtual flips over the Cab (Al deemed it “brilliant”) late this past week. The attention to detail is simply incredible. N-Fusion has been providing us with a new build every Monday, so we can see the incremental progress being made. I’m expecting a new build later today that should have all of Larry’s “idle animations” included for the first time, and, also for the first time, they’re loading my messages into the rooms. With each new Kickstarter update, I’m torn about releasing artwork. On one hand, it’s so unbelievably good that I just want to share it all with you and get you as pumped as Al and I are. On the other hand, Lost Wages is a lot smaller than, say, Morrowind, and every time I share finished background art, that’s one less major happy revelation you’ll get when you play the game. I’m inclined to err on the side of undersharing. It’s not that long ‘til testing starts anyway, and then much will be revealed to many of you. I don’t want to be miserly, though, so here are three previously-unreleased pieces of art: • The model sheet for the taxi driver. Love this guy! If we’d known he was going to look this good, we might’ve given him a bigger part (in the game)! • A rough animation of the clerk (in what we’re now calling the “Come ‘n’ Go”) being paid for something; I love how this guy’s movement is so simple and deft, but reeks of personality. <url>• A rough animation of the (only) babe in the bar at Lefty’s (she’s been the object of some prurient curiousity). Does Larry have a chance with her? You’ll just have to wait ‘til the end of this sentence, where I say, “No.” <url>’d like to turn over the microphone to Corey Cole, who, along with his wife Lori Cole, created one of the most unique game series in history: the Quest for Glory games. As we mentioned last week, they’ve got their own Kickstarter push going on for Hero-U (I am a full and vocal supporter), and Corey had this to say in an interview with AdventureGamers. It’s something Kickstarter supporters, and potential supporters, should read. Corey: We're not sure if you realize how much power you have. When we left Sierra, the game industry became mired in an endless succession of first-person shooters. Adventure games died overnight because publishers didn't want to spend millions of dollars on games that would only sell a couple hundred thousand copies. Gaming as we knew it died, except for a few decent MMOs. But now there are signs of life, and you're in charge. By backing projects you care about, games that have quality and good design, you can help make smaller games possible. Big publishers have so much overhead, they're only interested in mass-market games that don't require any brains to play. They've abandoned the adventure gamer, and are providing only a watered-down husk of role-playing games. Nobody has picked up the mantle we discarded in 1999, the idea of making an adventure game stronger by adding role-playing elements. It's a unique sub-genre that a lot of people found fun in the 1990s, and that most of you will still enjoy now. But it's up to you whether these games even get made, and whether they have enough budget to rise to the level of quality of top-tier games. You can't sit back and wait to see what will happen. If you do, here's what will happen – Nobody will make hybrid adventure/RPGs. Very few people will make adventure games of any type. The people who started paying attention when Double Fine Adventure and Project: Eternity got their huge budgets will say, "Ah, I thought so. Those were flukes. Nobody really cares about those kind of games. Next shooter! Next endless sports game clone! More action, more special effects, less thought!" You can stand up for the kind of games you want to play, or you can watch the adventure game renaissance die its second death. It's all up to you. Please support our new game, Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption on Kickstarter. And support other worthy games such as Shadowgate, ones with quality design that don't have $50 million advertising budgets. If you don't, the creative, thoughtful games will die out just as they did in 2000. Let's not let that happen this time, ok? Corey has said it better than I ever have, so I’ll leave it at that for today. Josh Hey guys. Josh is currently battening down the hatches and preparing to ride out Hurricane Sandy (or so he tells us, I think he may be in Hawaii this week), so I've stepped in to take over the Kickstarter Update. Let me first say that work on Larry is going great. N-Fusion is making some great strides, and everything is on course for you to have the game in your hot little hands by the first quarter of next year. Speaking of great adventure games (and really clever segues) we're releasing another adventure game in January. Look for Fester Mudd: The Curse of the Gold coming to Mac, PC, iOS, and Android devices. It's a great old school style, western themed adventure game packed to the gills with the kind of humor we know you love. Now, let me put your minds at rest. We acquired this game after it was already finished, Paavo Harkonen did an amazing job creating this game. All the original team has to do is port it over to a new engine. Us releasing this game has in no way detracted our focus from bringing you back Leisure Suit Larry. Think of it more as an added bonus. On a personal note, I've played through the current build of the game, and I really think you guys will love it. It was like discovering an adventure game from the early 90's that I'd never heard of. If you want to see screen shots, or video of the game, check out our Facebook page . Our very own Chief Creative Officer Josh Mandel (you know, the fellow who normally does these updates) is even lending a hand to the creators to punch up some dialogue, add some more descriptions, and generally cram in extra humor, because we know how important that is to you guys. With his extensive experience making the games you know and love, I’m sure he’s going to be able to find your funny bone. Paavo did a great job on the game, but when you’ve got an asset like Josh Mandel at your disposal, you use it. So if you were a little hesitant about picking up a game made by someone you’ve never heard of (and you shouldn’t be, this game is a blast) know that it’s coming through with that extra Josh polish you’re familiar with. For anyone who doesn't know, tensions have really been brewing on Larry's Facebook page . Seems Larry has decided to run for King of Daventry. There's been a lot of political mudslinging on both sides of this one. At the bottom of this post you'll see one of the videos that Larry and King Graham have been posting back and forth. So head over to Larry's page on November 6th and vote for who you think should be the next King of Daventry. I'd also like to point out to everyone that there are two new Kickstarters you might be interested in. Lori and Corey Cole's Hero-U , a new hero-based adventure game from the creators of Quest for Glory. It’s exactly the kind of thing you’ve been hoping for from them, and it’s definitely worth your support. And there’s the new Shadowgate Kickstarter , which we're very excited about. We always love it when the original creator of a franchise gets a chance to make something new with their creation. One of the great things about Kickstarter is it enables the people who made the games you LOVED provide you with something new. We hope you’ll show them the same love you’ve showed us! To conclude, I'd like to personally thank all of you for contributing to bring back Larry. It wouldn't have been possible without fan support, and you guys are some of the best fans I've ever seen. Thank you all, I promise we won't let you down. Jeff Hillary Community Manager Just a couple of brief notes today, and then onto something I know will make everyone salivate. N-Fusion completed their second milestone last week: the fully navigable game, using rough artwork and the music extracted from the VGA version of the game. No puzzles yet, but this way we’ll be able to see new animations, backgrounds, and features plug into the existing game as they’re readied. I fully expect us to have at least one or two exciting announcements VERY soon about the music. Selections have been made, details are being worked out, but I don’t want to post anything until all the ink on the contracts are dry. We had an outstanding reaction to our Social Media department’s request last time around. We’ve put some *exclusive* behind-the-scenes photos and concept artwork onto Replay Games Facebook page (you have to have “Liked” Replay Games to access it, and we’ll be adding new exclusive artwork to that page occasionally). I also have a new message from the Social Media department regarding a quasipolitical battle going on behind the scenes here (which has made for some very uncomfortable situations): In case you weren't aware, our pal Larry has his own Facebook page at <url>…@replaygamesinc. Okay. It’s time to reveal what many people would agree is the single most emblematic image in the game: the front of Lefty’s, as reimagined, polished, and finished by heroic artist Colin Merlo and the dedicated men and women of N-Fusion. View it and weep. 'Til we meet again, Josh Hello again. Josh here with a lot of this and that for You, our Best Beloved Kickstarter pledgers. Some weeks back, we promised you a video from Dennis Flath, Larry ’s Technical Art Director at N-Fusion and your pipeline to N-Fusion on the Replay fora. That video had to take a backseat for a while, as the game takes precedence over all. But things are settling down to an even, albeit frantic, pace, and so Dennis is back focusing on the video. You’ll probably see it before the next regular KS update. Dennis will also be doing a series of twice-monthly updates on the Replay fora. Keep a watch there, as these updates promise to touch on all different aspects of the production, different aspects than those we cover here in the KS updates. At this point, we have all the information we need from those of you whose names and/or likenesses are going to appear in the game. As we said during the Kickstarter phase, we consider ourselves very much at liberty to make jokes at your expense (gently, of course), because this is Larry and we’re simply not interested in being serious. If we inadvertently end up offending you deeply, then we’ll call it a job well done! There is one exception, one person we’ve been unable to reach: a Walk of Shame-level contributor who simply went by the name “INT.” INT, if you’re within the sound of my voice, please write to us. Mom is on the roof. I’m going to drop three more rough animations on you today. The first is of Lefty, the bartender. The second is of Larry, stumbling drunk. I’ve included these two because I think the motion (especially in the “stumbling drunk” sequence) is practically poetic; Colin Merlo is doing an outstanding job (both with the animations and backgrounds) and he constantly impresses me. And this is without the tweening that Al explained last time; these are only the key frames. Lastly, I’ve included one of Larry’s “idle” cycles. An idle cycle is a kind of “fidget” that the character does when the player doesn’t make him do anything for a while. I love idle cycles; they’re rare moments in which a character forgets that he/she is being watched, and does something unguarded and habitual. <url>’m committed to obliging that request, at least for the game’s major ladies (the hooker, Faith, Fawn, Jasmine, and Eve). In years past, when I’d work with a developer, they’d usually have some sort of homegrown dialogue tool, but N-Fusion said they’d accommodate any tool I wanted to use. So I set about looking at a number of programs, and I ended up with Urban Brain Studios’ powerful Chat Mapper program. Chat Mapper , as its name suggests, only does branching dialogue. But it does it with just about every kind of option I could possibly want, and it has an extremely powerful feature: the program fully understands all the dialogue logic and conditions you attach (e.g., “Don’t display dialogue options Y and Z unless the player has already played through dialogue options W and X”). Once you’ve attached the logic, you can test the entire tree from inside the program and fine-tune it. When you’ve got it the way you want it, you can then export the tree as an XML file, readily usable in Unity ( LSL1 ’s engine). In a conversation with Urban Brain Studios, I learned that adventure games from Sierra were, at least in part, what inspired the creation of Chat Mapper . I can tell you we would’ve killed for a utility like this at Sierra “back in the day.” Lastly, I’d like to pass along a message from our Social Media department: If you haven't already, please consider becoming a fan of our Facebook page at <url>’re willing to tell your friends about us, so much the better: if we hit 2,500 fans before the next Kickstarter update (that’ll be October 15th), we’re going to have a special contest to let one of our fans have their name in the game. That's right, your name could appear as someone who used to beat Larry up, or a girl he once lusted after, or maybe both. We can’t tell you ahead of time in what context your name could show up, but it would be forever memorialized in the world of Leisure Suit Larry. And all you need to do to have a shot at it is to “like” us, and help ensure we reach 2,500. And lastly, if your day needs just a little extra comedy in it, you should follow the man himself, Al Lowe, on Twitter. Just add @allowe and tell him Ken sent you. That about wraps it up for now. See you in a fortnight! Hi ya, gang. It's me – Al; Al Lowe. I finally got Josh away from the keyboard long enough to slap together a little update of my own for you. I hope it was worth the extra day’s wait. News Flash! The decision has been made: we are now firmly committed to making the game in 16:9 aspect ratio. Since this is the future of phones, monitors, TVs, and even laptops and tablets, we wanted you to see every bit of our game’s great art. Milestone Last Friday our developer, N-Fusion, passed their first milestone with flying colors. And black and whites. And animations. In other words, they rock! We’re so pleased that, after some early consternation, we have ended up with absolutely the right developers for this game. I know you’re going to be impressed with their work. N-Fusion Trivia One of the N-Fusion animators who is now working on Larry recently worked on “Sesame Street.” Ah, the ironic twists and turns of fate! New Graphics Speaking of animations, I thought you might like to see how they’re developed. Here’s a short video showing three rough animations: first, Larry in the cabaret, sitting down on the whoopie cushion; second, Larry in the convenience store, failing to pay for his purchase; and third, Larry in the disco, dancing with Fawn. This is how animation begins, with rough pencil drawings like these, with only the key frames of animation. They are then refined and polished, the in-between cells are added to smooth the animation; the timing is perfected; and the emotion is added — usually, of course, Larry’s embarrassment. <url>’t what they have to wash after Fashion Week in Manhattan, these are the way we guarantee that the characters in the game look the way we want them to and convey the right feelings. You’ve seen Larry’s model sheet before, but here it is again. And here's the sheet for the pimp: And finally, Faith, the guard outside the penthouse: But You Won’t See… You’re just going to have to take my word on this: the game’s new girl is shaping up nicely. And I mean that literally! But I’m afraid I can’t give you a sneak peek yet. You’re just going to have to wait. “Patience, Grasshopper.” In Closing I don’t know; after all this, it may be a while before Josh lets me back in here. But rest assured: all of us at Replay Games and N-Fusion consider this a “labor of love” and are doing our damnedest to make this so much more than just “another shovelware” version of some old game. Even though you’ve played Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards before, you’ve never played anything like this Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards! Just a quick note to say that the Biweekly Kickstarter Update you’d normally have read today will be arriving tomorrow, Tuesday, September 17th instead. After that, it will return to its normal every-other-Monday schedule. If you’re wondering why the scheduled update is going to be slightly late, it’s because The Man, Al Lowe himself, is guest-writing it…and we all know how much importance Al puts on ship dates. G’night, Josh Good day to you all, Larry backers! It’s Labor Day here in the States, and you know what THAT means: millions of children are quietly and studiously mulling the countless contributions that the working class has made to the strength and structure of the nation. Right? At this point, all of the emails have gone out to those of you who’ve pledged $40 or more. In fact, if you didn’t respond to the first email, we sent out a second. If you pledged at $40 or more, but you haven’t gotten an email from us, please check your Spam box to make sure it didn’t get lost in the shuffle. This is especially time-sensitive for those of you who’ll be getting your images worked into the game; the artists are working on those right now. So if you’re one of those, please look carefully for our email and, if you don’t find it, write to us at <email>. We’ll be sending out a new round of emails for those who pledged up to $39 very shortly. We’ve also had a question about the t-shirts, and we’ve decided that we’ll be offering the “female cut”-style T in addition to the standard style. We're also talking about creating a general-release Larry t-shirt, which we would make available for sale. It may have the same front as the existing design, but a different back, so that our Kickstarter supporters will still have an exclusive that nobody else will be able to get. No definite choice has been made yet as regards music. Al is still going through the process of finding a composer/arranger who’s right for the project. (Al and I agree that Chris Brayman set the bar VERY high in the VGA version of LSL1.) For voiceover, we’re currently planning to use Jan Rabson for Larry and Neil Ross as the Narrator. One name we talked about was Chris Parnell, whose narration in the PBS series “WordGirl” is sort of like Gary Owens with a healthy dose of snark added. But Neil is both a fan favorite and Al’s strong preference. So maybe we can use Chris for something in the future. (BTW, since we’ve been playing the “Who would play Larry in a live-action movie or TV show” game for almost 25 years now, I think Will Arnett would be a great choice…but twenty years ago, I envisioned Jon Lovitz in the role.) N-Fusion’s artwork is coming in almost as fast as Al and I can approve it, with model sheets, rough backgrounds, and rough animations (key frames only, no “tweening” yet) being submitted on a daily basis. We’re probably going to start releasing this artwork a little more generously than we have been, and that’ll happen primarily through Dennis on the Replay Forums. If there are days when we do a particularly large drop of artwork, I’ll send out a KS update notice about it. Today, for your entertainment pleasure, we’re releasing the completely-approved final model sheet for Larry. The only thing you won’t see on this sheet is the bald spot; that was worked out after the fact and hasn’t been incorporated into this particular image. You may notice several things about him compared to some previous versions. He looks a bit younger and his paunch is reduced (both in keeping with our plans for the character). His hair is different in a couple of regards (length and degree of hair loss), his leisure suit now has obvious lapels. His eyelids figure into a greater number of his expressions. That about wraps it up for today. Remember, if you pledged $40 or more, be sure to find and respond to our emails…or contact <email> if you haven’t. Your penpal, Josh Dear Backers, How are you? I am fine. If you haven’t come to the Replay Games forums recently, you’ve missed a lot of great info, art, and commentary by Dennis Flath, the Technical Art Director at N-Fusion. He checks in just about every day and has been answering questions right and left. Feel free to ask him any questions you want about N-Fusion’s dev process (and don’t forget you can ask me questions, too, also in the “Questions for the Team” subforum, which I check constantly). Britton Mathews, our website guru, updated the Replay Games site ( www.replaygamesinc.com ) and the forums ( <url>’ve moved over to a new server. If you have any problems at all accessing or using the site or forums, let us know so we can address it quickly – but, so far, it’s been a very smooth transition. Britton will also be sending out the surveys starting this week, so if you’ve got Leisure Suit Larry swag that’s supposed to be coming your way, you should get your survey soon. Kickstarter’s software only allows us to send these out *once*, so if you send yours in and it’s incomplete, or you want to change some information, contact us through Replay’s Customer Service and we’ll make sure it gets changed. The artists at N-Fusion, Al, and I have spent a good amount of time this past week on the Larry model sheet. It’s now pinned down and we’ll probably release this model sheet very soon (possibly before my next update). Al and I are both totally happy with the version we ended up with: it gives Larry a tiny bit of a younger look (so that we can age him gradually throughout the games that follow), the right attitude, a properly tailored leisure suit, and a nose that pays subtle tribute to male genitalia. Or is that my imagination? Oh, and N-Fusion is preparing a video update. They’re hoping to have it ready this week. I’ve been asked if we’ll be releasing model sheets for all the characters, and the answer is an “almost yes.” My current thought is: we’ll release them, but not all at once, and maybe we should avoid releasing the Jasmine model sheet so that she’s a total surprise. I’m really reluctant to take all the mystery out of her prior to the game’s release, since she’s the only real new major character in the game. Al has decided, at least for the time being, not to have his actual band playing in the game. He’s currently talking to a variety of composers/arrangers, and we hope to have a firm decision on this individual within the next couple of weeks. For my part, I’m currently working on the Age Verification questions. Trying to make them funny and not TOO tough. Those of you who are under 17 right now, or who are too old to remember trivia and current events from the very early 2000’s, had better bone up on your pop culture. (Rim shot!) Yours in Larry Laffer, Josh Good evening, LSL Backers... I'm interrupting my biweekly update schedule to deliver some news that many of you have been anxiously awaiting: the arrival of N-Fusion staff on the Replay Forum! Dennis Flath, the Technical Art Director on our project, has posted some bio information on himself and the rest of the team, given us some sample artwork, has dropped some other tidbits, and has committed to checking the Replay forums daily to answer quick questions (more comprehensive answers will have to wait for his bigger updates). Dennis already answered at least one or two interesting questions in the "Questions for N-Fusion" thread, in addition to the big info drop in the "Staff Introductions" thread. This Wednesday, he's aiming to post another art update. And we're kicking around the idea of video updates, since Dennis has an HD camera and is handy with editing software. Yea or nay? Please drop by and read his first major post here: <url>#p3442 Talk to you in a few days. Josh Greetings again from your faithful correspondent, Josh Mandel. During the past couple of weeks, both Paul and I have (on separate occasions) visited the offices of N-Fusion in beautiful New Jersey. Jeff Birns, the CEO and Creative Director at N-Fusion, led a six-hour meeting in which he and I, along with team members Chris, Joe, and Dennis, went over the design and milestones. Jeff’s approach to milestones is as meticulous as I’ve ever seen in this industry, with seemingly every miniscule detail plotted out and planned. On LSL , N-Fusion is undertaking several tasks at once. Programmatically, the game is being constructed from start to finish immediately, using sketches, placeholder animation, placeholder text, placeholder music, and even placeholder voices. This way, each finished asset can be dropped right into the game as it’s completed, and we can immediately see how it fits and identify any issues or revisions needed to make sure the completed asset works as needed. Simultaneously, the artists are developing model sheets for every character in the game. Al and I will go over the rough models before they’re brought to a finished state (as we will with the backgrounds and animations). Once the model sheets are complete, we plan to share some of them with you in future updates. Al and I are also spending a lot of time talking about the game’s music. This is one area that’s extremely near and dear to Al’s heart, what with his musical background, and I remember well on Freddy Pharkas how tightly Al holds those reins. I believe – but don’t swear me to it – that Al’s own band will be recording at least some of the in-game music. I’ve always felt that, as the original Sierra LSL series progressed, the music got jazzier and jazzier, to the point where the melody line – the most infuriatingly catchy melody in the business – was getting a little too lost. Moreover, LSL1 specifically takes place in a Vegas-like atmosphere. So my suggestion to Al was that, since neither the original LSL1 nor the LSL1-VGA remake has had a Vegas soundtrack, that that’s what we should strive for here: a brassy, big-band sound such as you might hear accompanying The Rat Pack. Al agreed that this was a new and appropriate direction for the music, so I’m tremendously excited by this. We’re currently reviewing various arrangers. One last bit of great news, which I freely admit is purely victory-by-association for all of us with a stake in LSL : N-Fusion has been declared a Finalist in the Unity 2012 Awards for their most recently-released game, Air Mail ! Better still, they're not just Finalists in one category...they're Finalists in three categories: Best Visual Experience Best Gameplay Golden Cube Award (given to the Grand Prix Winner) The Finalists are individually selected by Unity "to honor the best content being created with Unity." The awards will be presented on Thursday, August 23rd. ( Air Mail , not incidentally, was the iPad Editor's Choice in the App Store when it was first released in late May.) The complete list of Finalists: <url>’ve got my fingers crossed for them, and I know Larry, wherever he is, is pulling for them as well. But then again, Larry pulls for everybody. My name is Josh Mandel, and I approve this update. P.S. Here’s a shot Paul took of N-Fusion’s drool-inducing PC game library, which includes just about every adventure game you’ve ever heard of: Happy Monday, LSL1 backers. Josh Mandel here to cover the current events. I’ve committed to writing updates for you on a biweekly basis at a minimum, even if there’s nothing dramatic to report. Speaking of drama, let’s address the elephant in the room: our switch from Adventure Mob to N-Fusion. I won’t revisit the details, nor address arguments that’ve been made in forums and message boards around the gaming community, but I want to mention that the decisions not to go with Adventure Mob and to go, instead, with N-Fusion were made independently weeks apart. This was not a case of N-Fusion offering a better deal and an abrupt abandonment of one for the other. Paul Trowe, Al Lowe, and I agreed unanimously in both cases, and we agreed on the need to separate from Adventure Mob well before we agreed that N-Fusion was very well suited to accomplish our goals for the game. That’s all I feel comfortable talking about publicly, at least for the time being. Al and I have finished the redesign of the game. This includes the new locations and the new female character (her name, it can now be told, is Jasmine , and that name is not merely incidental). But we’ve also redesigned many of the other puzzles. In some cases, Al identified puzzle sequences that he had always felt could use improvement; in other cases, we agreed together that there would be ways to handle a given puzzle sequence either more logically, more entertainingly, or both. We were careful not to stray too far from the source material because we still want the game to feel like the game you’ve played before. But we also didn’t want original players to be able to blow through the game effortlessly. Another thing we’ve done is worked in a couple parodies of popular games. It’s always been one of Al’s trademarks to include in his games sly tips-of-the-hat to other games. For instance, the Larry games have always included references to other Sierra game series (a problem for us now, given the rights issues), and those of you who remember our last co-design, Freddy Pharkas, Frontier Pharmacist , will recall the parody of Lemmings as envisioned with snails. We’ve done the same with the LSL1 redesign, but even though the game takes place in the ‘80s, we’ve updated the games we’re parodying for modern audiences. (Don’t worry, there are no arcade sequences in our LSL1 redesign. The original LSL1 didn’t have them, and neither will this remake.) For my part, I’ve been spending copious amounts of time writing in-game messages related to the inventory items in the game. That’s something I can do independent of artwork. So I have my immense spreadsheet of inventory items (there are far more items in the remake than in the original) and have been doing what I love to do most of all: rewarding exploration. There’s an interesting article related to this on the Adventure Gamers website; read it at <url>’ve asked the artists at N-Fusion to plan now to create what I refer to as “Skirvins.” Bil Skirvin was one of the artists on many of the Larry games (and Art Director on the LSL1-VGA remake), and he occasionally worked into the backgrounds shapes that are, perhaps, best described as “subtly lewd.” I want the new Larry to maintain this tradition and, if possible, improve on it; gamers these days are very used to finding hidden objects, so I think that kind of exploration also deserves reward, even if it’s as passive part of your gaming experience (no, you won’t be able to click on them and get twinkly particle effects and a note in your mystery-keeper’s journal). By the time another two weeks rolls around, I think I’ll have a lot more to talk about and show you. For now, N-Fusion is simply getting their minds wrapped around our perverse little project here, and I do plan to ask them to start joining in on the conversations on the Replay Games forum as well. My name is Josh Mandel, and I approve this message. Hey, Guys, Josh Mandel here. As we've mentioned many times before, updates for the game, Q&amp;A with the developers, and so on have all moved to the Replay Games forum ( <url>"public identity" of Larry in most people's minds, does have to participate sometimes). Paul knows more about guerilla marketing than Al and I put together; he has a great track record of getting games funded and launched. But if we're going to make LSL1 a big enough hit to fund LSL2 (and LSL2 a big enough hit to fund LSL3, etc.), it is CRUCIAL to the success of our long-term goal that he be out selling and promoting the LSL brand *constantly* and as energetically as possible. To ding him for this, or to suggest that the game will be made faster if he'd stop traveling and promoting the series, is simply wrong. Al and I are working away ourselves while Paul is off doing his thing. His thing doesn't slow us down, and when all is going smoothly, we don't slow HIM down. For updates on the game, PLEASE go to the Replay Games forum. (We'll actually be putting out a couple of big announcements pertinent to the game -- and the series -- within a day or two!) And in the meantime, I hope you'll support Paul's efforts to bring the whole LSL series back into the public eye. Those efforts are integral to what Al and I are doing, and I think they're actually quite integral to the gist of why you all supported the game so well in the first place. Thanks for reading, and I'll see you at the Replay Games forum. I check in there frequently. --Josh p.s. <url>"Z". It's a Kickstarter project by one of the guys at Venture Beat named Sebastian. He was also coincidentally the moderator of our Kickstarter panel today at GamesBeat. He's an awesome guy, this is his dream, and he told us he'd be honored if Al would join Tim Schafer and Ron Gilbert as special guest zombies or survivors in the game. Al &amp; I thought it would be cool for him to be a zombie so that's what you're getting if you help Kickstart this campaign. Today they recently announced that one of the guys from Mythbusters is going to be a survivor in the game as well so the lineup is pretty damn cool. I'm a backer only because I think the game is going to be cool AND I totally want to see Al made up in Zombie makeup and eat the guy from Mythbusters. :) Anyway, this is our attempt to help push them past their goal and make their dream a reality too. <url>"to make Christmas" that is just riddled with bugs (anybody remember some unnamed PC games that would ship super buggy in hopes the patch would come out before the game hit the shelves?). So anyway, that's the bad news. The good news is that I've created a blog!! I have never blogged in my entire life but I feel that now is a damn good time to start. You guys motivated me by asking for constant updates so the way we're going to deliver them to you is via the Replay Games forum. So far we have 2 sections: "Announcements/News" and "Paul's development blog". Here's the link to the READ ONLY section of the forums: Replay read only forums. I suggest you bookmark it since I plan on blogging pretty much every day on what's going on. I'm not saying I won't post here (like a lot of you guys want), but it just makes sense to keep things in one place. If you don't feel like going through the multiple forums to find what you're looking for (and reading reply after reply after reply) then you're going to love those 2 sections. Ok, it's 2am and I seriously need to get to bed. I haven't been skydiving since before the Kickstarter campaign and I really need to relieve some stress so I'm taking the weekend off (please don't hate me) and am going to jump out of a perfectly good airplane as many times as I can between tomorrow and Sunday. Until next time, your humble servant, -Paul YOU DID IT!!! Nothing could make me more proud right now, you guys!! We promise to give this game the entire 25+ years of experience each one of us veterans has to put all of the culmination of our years of making great games in to this product. We think (and hope) you'll like it as much as we like making it. Here's a special thank you from one of the stars, Mr. Josh Mandel, himself. -Paul T. signing off (and going to bed.....finally!) Future updates will be done on The Replay Games Forum from now on, gang. <url>"on" the last 30 days for 24 hours/day until Josh &amp; Al called and said "Paul, get out of bed...we have this brilliant idea for the last 24 hours...we want to do a Larry Blow Out". So, with every last piece of energy I had, I got out of bed, stopped by the local coffee shop and fueled up with caffeine, got in to the office and uploaded Al's video. Not five minutes after I uploaded the video it's already been watched over 115 times. You guys are fast, man!!! Ok, so...here's Josh &amp; Al's awesome idea. We hope you like it. We're dropping some of the super high tiers by a couple of bucks to help you guys get to the $650k mark and get yourselves another girl and more story for the game. We're doing everything we can at this end, so please help us out and do everything you can at your end, ok? And in the meantime, I'll stay up with you until the very last minute...pushing and shoving our way to $650k to get you guys what you want. I just hope to God I don't have a heart attack after this thing is over. I still have to get to E3 in June. Ugh. :) Oh, sorry...one last thing. Here's a link to show the totals of Kickstarter &amp; PayPal so you guys know how close we are to the $650k mark. It updates every 5 minutes and is on the Eastern time zone. Huge shout out to Britton for making this work at the last minute. <url>"Larrywood Walk of Shame Edition." We're gonna do up Lost Wages like Hollywood, with stars along the sidewalks all over the city, and we're allowing 20 donors (no more) to "buy" a star with their name on it. (Of course, Larry will be permitted to make a comment about your star, unless your name is funny enough by itself.) We think this will be a cool addition to the game, and a great way to memorialize yourself into the actual fabric of Lost Wages...outside of getting your name on a poster at the Post Office. And since there's no Post Office in the game, who would see THAT except for NPCs? More to come as this historic Kickstarter drive comes to a close in less than 2 days! Josh Hey you guys, so it looks like Twitch.tv shut us down on the charity fund raiser but relentless John has got it back up and running on UStream. Here's the link everybody: <url>’ve been batting around a lot of concepts for added goals, and weighing each one in our hands, side by side with their budgets, likes pairs of fine, ripe, fibrous coconuts, freshly descended from the gnarled tree trunks of Nontoonyt Island. Juggling one against another, over and over, 'til our hands were raw. We don’t want to overpromise, but we also want to squeeze every drop out of our budget in pursuit of the ultimate Larry experience for the dollar. So, here's the easier one: at the $550,000 level, we will be maxing out the game responses along the lines I suggested in my video update. Tons more jokes, tons more responses for clicking on screen features, dialogue trees , inventory-on-inventory messages , and more story ! We’ll load every existing nook and cranny with extra content because, as Al pointed out to us, the original was “kinda thin” on that. Now, here's the big one: at the $650,000 level, we're doing something that will change the face of Larry forever (if only!): we're adding a new location, new puzzles, and a new girl with her own storyline ! Is this the infamous female character that Al was forced to cut from the original 1987 version of Leisure Suit Larry 1? Or am I just making that up entirely to add a sense of mystery? Your guess is as good as mine! So that's the news for tonight; we hope you'll find it stimulating. Two new goals, and we think they're 100% reachable. And, as we strain and struggle towards the inevitable climax of this Kickstarter program, we'll continue to read and respond to all your thoughts, hopes, dreams, advice, and secret confessions. Sleep well, Josh OOPS!!! Ok, so maybe I should be shot for this because I feel like this should have been at the TOP of the list of things to tell you about. Please don't hate me!!! Tomorrow, one of our fans, John A., is hosting a special marathon session where he's going to play through the entire Leisure Suit Larry franchise starting at LSL 1 and ending at LSL 7. He's doing this to raise money for the campaign and to also raise money for charity. 50% of the money raised will go directly to the "It Gets Better Project" ( www.itgetsbetter.org ) and the other 50% will go to our Kickstarter campaign. All of us here at Replay can not think of a kinder thing to do for such a special charity that is 100% altruistic and giving directly from his heart. As an added bonus, Al Lowe, Josh Mandel, and myself will make guest appearances throughout the marathon and chat / interact with you guys. We obviously can't stay in there the whole time, but hopefully you'll be in there when one of us are there so you can catch us and ask us ALMOST anything. :) Hopefully we can raise enough money to make a difference in these kid's lives. Below is a video John put together to talk about the event and here is the direct link where you should go tomorrow, Saturday, from 10am Eastern time until midnight: <url>"suit" as you guys call me (even though I'm wearing a tye die, shorts, and Birkenstocks today), am going to make that call. For that call, I am leaving it to the two best game designers in the entire world (obviously my opinion) to tell you what's coming up next. Later on tonight the one and only Josh Mandel will be giving you a new update on what you can expect with the additional "stuff" we're throwing at you in the new version of Leisure Suit Larry 1. I've learned a long time ago that when I start telling creative people what to do is when I get in to serious trouble. Now that that's out of the way, let me give you part 3 of the fireside chat with Al &amp; I. I just watched it and it brought a tear to my eye. This is by far the best part. But please, gang, help spread the word about the campaign after you get the update from Josh about what we're adding because with the extra money we really can deliver a bunch of new stuff nobody has ever seen. And considering this will most likely be the last Leisure Suit Larry 1 EVER, we aim to achieve everything you hope for and more. Have a wonderful weekend, you guys!! -Paul T. <url>"fireside chat" with the two of us. Well, apparently Al likes to talk (A LOT) so we had to break it up in to 3 segments. Here's part 1 where Al and I talk about how he got in to the video game business. I hope you like it since we put a ton of work in to making sure it looked great for you guys!!! That, plus camera angles, Adobe Premier, YouTube issues, and Britton breaking Al's window (by accident of course) all made for an awesome weekend in Seattle!! Oh yeah...it was sunny the ENTIRE TIME!! BTW, we're totally working on getting you guys some more details on what you voted for: more content!! Please don't forget to vote at: forums.replaygamesinc.com on what you'd like to see once we blow past the initial $500k. I'll post the Part 2 tomorrow!!! -Paul <url>"reins" of localization to Paul at Sierra where Paul went on to write the "Sierra On-Line Localization Bible" and Sabine was promoted to Producer where she worked hand in hand with Jane Jensen on her masterpieces Gabriel Knight 2 &amp; 3. After the company was sold, Sabine and Paul left Sierra with Paul going to Activision to become a localization producer and Sabine going to Broderbund to head up international publishing. The two have never stopped working together and have once again joined forces at Replay to bring the best games to the international marketplace. Here is Sabine's "into" video where she talks about localizing Leisure Suit Larry, and her amazing contribution to the awesome "reunited" team to being you one of the best games in computer game history! <url>"behind the scenes" video update. In addition, we've just added a new $5 tier for people that want SOMETHING, and since it looks like we're blowing past the $500k by May 2nd, we've added a survey to ask you what you'd like to see once we hit our next milestones of $600k, $700k, $800k, etc. Let us know by going to: HERE and use your forum ID and password to login and let us know what you'd like to see added to the game!! And now, I present to you: Oran &amp; Oded from Adventure Mob!!!! <url>"The Lefty's Bar Pack". In this awesome (and very difficult to put together tier) you get the following: 1) an official Lefty's shot glass, 2) 4 official Lefty's coasters, 3) Lefty's official breath spray, and 4) an official Lefty's sexy lady "reveal" pen. Each item will be proudly imprinted with the logo of what Destructoid names "The best bar in video game history!". What's that? You want to see what the logo looks like? Well, in that case, take a look on the front page at the new T-shirt design we just posted. That same logo will be imprinted on each of the Lefty's bar pack items that you can personally use to pick up real life women (in case you're in to that sort of thing). Anyway, we hope you enjoy these two awesome things we've been working on night and day to get you guys. That $150 tier has been something a LOT of people have been wanting. So, we're listening and we hope you guys enjoy them as much as we enjoyed making them for you!!!! Until next time, -Paul T. p.s. HUGE MAD PROPS go out to Jeannette (our Associate Producer) and Oran Bar-Tal (Adventure Mob Producer) for working around the clock to get these things for you guys!! The famous "baby daddy" of Larry Laffer, Mr. Al Lowe, addresses issues such as the Replay forums, new tiers, the T-Shirt, and just some good ole' fashioned Al Lowe love!!! Take it away, Al!!! <url>"I tell all" it wouldn't make much sense so...there you have it. :) This video might be a little longer than I should have made it but I wanted to squeeze in every tiny juicy detail I possibly could. Besides, who doesn't like hearing themselves talk? Admittedly, I was a bit nervous doing this at 2:00am here in the office but if I did it during the day everybody else would be like "who the hell is he talking to?". So...without further ado, here is your next video update. Please don't yell at me for taking too long you guys....I wanted to tell you the whole story about why and how we're doing this. Besides, you can always skip it and do your homework instead. :) <url>"Special Thanks" credit in the game. Well, we've listened and Josh &amp; Al are hard at work creating a "Backer" T-shirt with Larry on it. See? We DO listen!! Well, until the next update.... -Paul T. p.s. did i say how awesome you guys are for backing us and believing in this project? No? Well....you guys are AWESOME for backing us and believing in this project. We all worked very hard to get the right to re-make Larry and you guys are making our dreams come true. Thank you VERY, VERY much!!! Hey gang!! Sorry this update took so long. We wanted to try and address as many of your comments, suggestions, and concerns, and have Al Lowe himself create the video. Expect more frequent updates as we totally hear you guys....we know you want to hear from us more and we think video blogging is going to be the best way to move forward. Sorry for the confusion...we just want to make this the best Larry game ever!!! -Paul T. p.s. Al wanted me to edit out the end because he couldn't find the "off" button but I left it in there to get back at him for this video taking so long for him to submit!! Ah, it's the little things in life that make me happy!! :) <url>"Ukash voucher", then convert it into a "Ukash NEO pre-paid Mastercard". From there, you can use it with Amazon's payment system. In many areas of Europe, you can use your Visa Debit or Visa Electron cards to pay online. Also, be sure to add $1 extra to the ukash cards. Apparently other Kickstarters have said that Amazon holds on to an extra dollar when you enter in the information and it can cause payments to fail otherwise. Thanks Tim Schaefer and Ryan Voots for the info!!!!!! Hey, gang, it’s me, Al Lowe . I just wanted to take a moment here shortly before midnight to tell you just how blown away I am by all your love and support! You guys are great! It looks like we’re well on our way to funding this project – and with no publisher necessary. And, I want to assure you: every one of your comments, suggestions, and thoughts that you’ve posted,Facebooked, Tweeted, or emailed is being read and taken seriously. You do have a voice here. But don’t stop now. I need you to help us spread the word via any means you can to as many people as possible! We even got an easy URL for you: <url>
