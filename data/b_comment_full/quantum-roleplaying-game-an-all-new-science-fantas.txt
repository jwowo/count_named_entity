The past nearly two months have been awful. I've struggled mightily to get the final art pieces in, even going so far as to seek additional art help for Hugo with no positive results. I've hesitated to discuss art struggles as my own writing and design struggles have been significant, but I feel all struggling aspects of this game now need to be discussed, not just my own. At this point, I may have to release the book missing some of the monster art and without a poster map. I seriously hope this doesn't happen, but I can't wait for the art any longer. Financially, I reached the wall where continuing to work on this game without a paycheck is not possible. I then had to spend time looking for, finding, and then accepting a new part-time job. It's not exactly the sort of job I want to shout to the roof tops, but it pays the bills. It also takes a great deal of time away from what I want to be working on (the game), but after the "busy period" I'm in right now at work ends in a few weeks, things to will settle back down to where I can crush the remaining chapters. Colleen is the bright spot in these last two months. She's banging out some amazing layout work despite working a full time job. Her work is amazing and I think you'll be equally impressed. My goal right now is to have the entire game out of my meddlesome hands by Turkey Day with the final book, at minimum, released as a PDF by the New Year and well on its way through the printing process with our overseas printers. We are very close to being done and have unfortunately been very close for a while now. I'm back to frequent updates again and I'm sorry for the lack of updates. -Josh Hey backers! Here's a quick little graphic I whipped up in preparation for an update next week going over the archer Paradigm and some of the builds one might choose when creating an archer Hero. I couldn't wait to show off the trees, so here they are. Details forthcoming. Also, there's a reason I'm not a graphic designer. ;-) So don't think this graphic will be in the final book. Because. Ick. No. -Josh Hey backers! I just finished every Core Paradigm Style, Paradigm Style Tree, and Universal Style in Chapter 2: Hero Creation. Now I need to write or re-write the text around those boondoggles and Chapter 2 will be out of my hands and into editing. As a reference, Chapter 2 is 62 pages in the final book totaling just under 38,000 words. Once handed off to edit, that will mean 72% of the book is out of my hands and off to the next phases. Also, I added Chapter 3: Gear &amp; Gadgets to the Design forums a few days ago for download and reading. That's four out of eight chapters now finalized post-editing, off to layout, and available for all backers who gave $10 or more to the project to download and read. Now I leap into the rest of Chapter 2. Josh Hello backers! Every backer who gave $10 or more to the project can now request access to the Design boards on the Infinite X Studio forums . There are currently three chapters up: Chapter 1: Getting Started Chapter 4: Challenges &amp; Combat Chapter 5: Omnimancy These chapters are final chapters. They've been through design, development, writing, and editing and are in the hands of the graphic designer for layout. Chapter 3: Gears &amp; Gadgets is now back from edit and should also be up on the Design boards later this week. All backers who gave $10 or more to the project should have a message from me in their Kickstarter message box. Reply to that message with your forum name on the Infinite X Studio forums and I'll grant your account access to the Design boards (as well as give you your swanky new Design Level Backer title and symbol). Reply to your message. Get access to the Design boards. Download the chapters. And read, read, read. Josh Hey folks! This is just a quick update to let you know I'm still here and the game is still progressing. I hope to put up a larger update next week showing some rules changes implemented during my work this last month. Until then, here are teasers of those changes: Armor Rating changed to be simpler and require less paperwork. My original intent was to have Style Trees rather than just Styles. I figured out how to do that without changing much. Style Trees allow for "builds," even within Paradigms that aren't the Generalist. Each Paradigm (except the Generalist) has two Core Styles and two Core Abilities. The rest of the Styles are now General Paradigm Styles learnable by most Paradigms. General Paradigm Styles will still be restricted to Fatigue or Prime, though some have neither as a requirement. There are three Style Trees, tentatively called Melee, Omnimancy, and Erudite. You start at the top and purchase your way down various branches of your choosing to get the build you want. The Melee branch is associated with Fatigue, the Omnimancy branch with Prime, and the Erudite branch with neither. Next week I want to preview the new Archer along with possible builds. This will serve to both preview the rules changes and show off the new Archer. Until then! Josh Hey folks! Just a quick update this week. I had a facepalm moment last week that helped me solve the damage conundrum (more on that later), so with that fixed I jumped back into the Book of Beasts chapter and the Hero Creation chapter. The Omnimancy chapter, which was out for the first editing pass, is now back in, so I can now apply the editing changes and send another chapter off to layout. So right now we have one chapter in edit, one returned from edit, two chapters in layout, and five chapters in various states of completion, most of them nearing completion. Hugo is finishing up two additional figures for the setting chapter and spending time on the full-color world map. Out of anything he's working on, I'm most eager to see the map! I've also decided (in part thanks to a pulse-taking thread on my author Facebook page ) that once a week updates are too many and will now move to one update every other week plus additional updates as we cross milestones (such as new art received, chapters off to layout, and so on). Once a week updates are forcing me to post when there aren't milestones to report and that hasn't been productive. I'm also going to back off posting insight into the process and instead focus on surface details such as milestones, setting information, etc. Whenever I delve into the realm of "here's something that's giving me nightmares recently" or "here's a mistake I made" the responses tend to be in the "shut up and stop complaining and get to work" category. Those responses are less than helpful. The game progresses! Josh Hello backers! Got some new art previews in this week from Hugo. He would want me to say these are just rough sketches. ;-) What's great about these sketches, is I'm starting to see the figures for the nation art orders come to life, breathing personality into their home nations from the world of Quantum. The first is an azi scientist from the Republic of Aranam, a nation written by backer Rob Gaffney. The second is a famous character named Airdock, an automaton from the Free Cities of Kadjar, a nation written by backer Paul Rees. The third and final is an elderly azi troubadour from Kadru, a nation written by backer Charles Cunningham. I can't wait to see the finals for these sketches. I have it on good authority from Hugo that we'll be seeing some of the world map soon and I plan to preview that as I get it. It'll likely be rough at first, but since it's a full color poster map for the hardcover and I'm a huge fan of Hugo's cartography, I'm positive it'll be fantastic. As for progress, I've torn down a few systems in the past few weeks and I'm in the process of building them back up with the goal of making them simpler to use and understand. These systems include damage, Styles, and Stances. I'm often woken suddenly in the middle of the night, heart pounding, feeling sheer terror at the idea that anything for this game will miss the primary design objective of being simple to learn, easy to play, and complex only from decisions and strategies and not from the rules. I'm stubborn about getting it right. Josh Hello! It's been a slow past few weeks as I've struggled with the doubt demon as it pertains to two subsystems of the game: tracking damage to the three Damage Scales and how to scale Styles in a way that seems consistent and yet makes both story sense and logical sense. I think I've solved the latter, the former still gives me nightmares. Here's the issue: The Damage Scales have made sense to me for a while, but after finalizing the Omnimancy chapter and sending it off to edit, the bit in Omnimancy about tracking the two types of damage to the Prime scale an Omnimancer deals to herself when performing an Equation (Damage Over Time and Reserved Damage) more and more doesn't seem to fit with the bubbles used on the Hero record sheet. I'm brainstorming various ways to change how the damage is presented in order to make it easier to know exactly how much Prime damage an Omnimancer has taken as well as making it simpler to remove Reserved damage once an effect ends and still know at a glance what the total damage to the scale is. I could use your help. I'd appreciate any suggestions on how to do this. I don't really want to eliminate the idea of various Styles and specific Paradigms/beasts/foes being able to influence the number of dots at each step of a Damage Scale, but eliminating that is on the table. I thought about simply having two sets of bubbles for both the Wound Damage Scale and the Root Scale—one bubble set for damage that's Regained over time and the second for Reserved damage. Then each set could have totals beneath that represent each step of the scale and those totals would start out as blank lines that you fill in and change as your Hero advances. Then one would just add together the two bubbles for a given Damage Scale, compare to the step totals below, and know where she stands as far as penalties are concerned. That way, as you Regain over time and remove Reserved damage, you wouldn't constantly have to erase and then re-fill in the boxes with X or /. What do you think? What's worked for you in playtesting? Did you change anything for your group? It works okay when I playtest it, but I think it could work better. Finally, in the coming weeks, a friend will be assisting me in setting up some Google+ hangouts for playtest sessions. This would give you an opportunity to see more of the final rules and help me get a wider playtest audience for some of the changes that have been made since the beta. I imagine I'll run these in the late afternoon on the weekends in order to accommodate schedules for as many time zones as possible. Does this sound like something you'd be interested in? What would you like to see in a one hour or so playtest session? How many players do you think would be the right number? Looking forward to your answers and suggestions. Josh Hello, backers! The last week was spent conquering the profiles for the beasts portion of the Beasts &amp; Foes chapter as well as finishing most of the text before the profiles begin. This increased progress on that chapter by 10% and my goal is to have the rest of the chapter finished and in editing by the next update. Now that I've finished quite a few more beasts (beyond what appeared in the Beta), I thought I'd give you a preview of the beast featured on the cover of the Quantum Roleplaying Game: the dragon! Those of you paying attention at home may find several hints at rules changes not previously divulged. Below you'll find the dragon art as well as the progress sheet. But first: the profile! Enjoy! DRAGON Omnimancy Beast, Exomancy (Demon) Ranks : 35–75 Wound Steps : 5/4/3/2/1/1; Fatigue Steps : 5/4/3/2/1/1 Beast Styles : Creator, Natural Aviator; Rank 60+ : Maneater Grid : 4x4 BACKGROUND Dragons likely existed in the Time Before as gladiatorial amusements. There are fragmented records of them in stadium-sized terrariums, living in fighting groups of as many as ten dragons. These records also show massive crowds of humans and azi seated in expansive amphitheaters watching two or more dragons battling to the death while wearing collars meant to restrain them or remotely control them. The Progenancy theorizes that only a few dragons survived the apocalypse of a millennium ago, but given their extreme longevity and shrewd intelligence those few managed to come together and breed. Instead of continuing to live in groups, however, they became solitary, antisocial creatures. So much so, in fact, that two dragons mating is one of the most rare occurrences among the creatures of Quantum. ECOLOGY Dragons demarcate large territories as their own by emitting pheromones that only other dragons can smell. While dragons respect these demarcations, other creatures don’t. This leads to violent encounters between dragons and the civilized races, especially in the skies above. Female dragons give birth to a single live newborn that can immediately survive on its own. Within minutes of birth, the baby dragon is chased from its mother’s territory, driven into the Wilds to find its own. Dragons prefer warm, dry climates but as these territories were claimed hundreds of years ago, newborns are moving into the lower elevations, establishing hunting grounds in rain forests, marshes, and even ocean islands. No one knows exactly how long dragons live, but the Progenancy is tracking three dragons still alive from the Time Before.

Regained : O. -Josh Good evening, backers! A quick update today. Chapter 3: Gear &amp; Gadgets and Chapter 5: Omnimancy are now complete and off to Reid for edits. With those out of the way, I can turn back to Chapters 2 and 7, the largest of the two chapters. I hope to have both done in the next few weeks. The Omnimancy chapter in the progress graphic below says 110%—it should say 100%. I'll correct that in the next update. Josh Howdy folks! Sorry (again) for the lack of update last week. I don't have much to report that moves the sliders on the update page, so I've not updated it. What I do have to report is that both the Gears &amp; Gadgets chapter and the Omnimancy chapter should be in editing this week. After that, I'll resume work on the Book of Beasts chapter which I had to pause in order to finalize decisions in the Gadgets and Omnimancy chapters that related to various beasts and foes. After that, I'm back into the biggest chapter of them all, Hero Creation, which will likely take 2-3 weeks to finalize. The remaining chapters after those are done should be completed in relatively quick order. So while progress has been slow the past few weeks, we're quickly approaching the top of Writing/Re-Writing Mountain and should soon start sliding quickly down it. Josh Happy Quantum Monday, backers! Sorry for last week's missed update. Since the last update two weeks ago, I completed another 25% or so of the Beasts &amp; Foes chapter and over-wrote the Omnimancy chapter by about 10%. This puts the overall project just a hair past 50%. I leapt some major hurdles in my process for designing the stats for beasts and foes (hurray, Excel!) and that vastly improved my speed at finishing the statistics in each profile and making sure they're accurate at the same time. Seriously, any game I've ever worked on, the hardest part is always making stats decisions and then repeatedly double-checking them to make sure your decisions are mathematically correct. Ugh. I love designing games and worlds and characters, but after two or three hours of dancing around a spreadsheet, my eyes glaze over and I smash through the living room window in search of braaaaaaains. -Josh Good afternoon, backers! First I want to say that to those of you who live in the Boston area or may have had friends or family members in the Boston area on Monday, it is my sincere hope that you and all of your friends and loved ones are safe and sound. This was a terrible event and I hope none of you were in harm's way. I spent this past week continuing to push forward toward the finale of the beast and foe chapter. After completing the summaries for most of the beasts and foes, though, I've decided to make a change. The concept of core abilities for the denizens of this chapter was set to mirror the concept of core abilities for the Paradigms. However, the more beasts and foes I completed, the more I struggled to find truly unique core abilities that fit each one of them. And after spending more time than I wanted trying to fill these abilities, I decided to remove core abilities from beasts and foes altogether and leave them as unique additions to the Hero Paradigms. Some beasts or foes may still receive core detriments (such as what the zombaton has in the beta), but the beasts and foes in the final book will each be unique by their appearance, Attributes, Expertise choices, and Styles rather than those features plus a core ability. This change, I think, will also simplify the summaries for each one, free up word count for additional background and ecology information, and give the Guide less information to remember when she guides a scene with several beastly adversaries for the Heroes. I'm curious to hear your thoughts. Josh Good afternoon, backers! This past week was spent zipping through the remaining summaries for each beast and foe (now that the summary is locked down for layout purposes). It didn't really give the project a percentage increase (since the percentages for writing are based on word count), but it did move the project along. A long conversation with a good friend this weekend in which we questioned all of the standard conventions for RPGs led me to an idea that has the strong possibility to push the Quantum RPG up another notch. The Paradigm concept did not change from the beta playtest feedback, it was only slightly modified or improved in places. And the idea that came to me this weekend doesn't really change the concept either, it just moves the camera slightly to the left and gives the idea a fresh perspective. I began to think about the Paradigms I want in the game (both defined Paradigms and the generalist) when it occurred to me that all of the Paradigms break down into four categories: Soldier Archer, Hunter, Myrmidon, Reaver, Slayer, and Warrior Esomancer Sage, Shaman Exomancer Necromancer, Warlock Emissary Corsair, Crusader, Immortal, Progenitor, Troubadour, Valkyrie Soldiers are individuals with some professional training (be it via government, tribe, clan, or gang), Esomancers can access the Suria source, Exomancers can access the Void source, and Emissaries represent specific organizations (pirate clans, the Progenancy, etc). The leap I took after questioning my own conventions was this: there is really no need for a generalist Paradigm. If I take each category as a group with some shared Styles, that allows for customization within those categories. For example, the Archer would have his own Core Ability and ~2 exclusive Styles, but then the other ~4 Archer Styles would be available for all of the Soldiers. This same method of exclusivity and sharing could then be branched out for Esomancers, Exomancers, and Emissaries. Each Paradigm still retains its unique flavor, but now players can have an additional layer of customization as they build and then grow their Hero. The best part of this potential change is that it requires almost no re-writing and no additional design. It's simply a cosmetic change with (I think) profound results. I'm strongly leaning toward implementing this immediately with a follow-up post that quickly details which beta Styles (or Styles Trees as they were in the beta) are exclusive and which can be shared, thus giving you an opportunity to try it out now. But, first, I want to make sure I'm not loving the sound of my own voice. What say you? Like the idea? Or really like the idea? ;-) -Josh Good afternoon, backers! I really hate the term "stat block." I wish I could find another term that I could use universally for the Quantum RPG that doesn't summon images of math formulas in a super max prison. Since I can't, however, I'll just have to keep the term for now. Anyway, some progress was made this week on the beast and foe front. Finished another 10% of the chapter and finally hammered out the details for a stat block that doesn't melt your brain when you look at it. The trade off is that instead of four or five different ranks for each beast or foe's entry in Chapter 8, there will now just be three. The new stat block, I think, is easier to read, easier to manage as a Guide in a fight scene, and just better looking. I hope you agree. Here are two entries (just text) with the new stat blocks. These entries haven't been edited, yet, and haven't gone through their final number crunches, but I'm relatively certain they won't change much in the final book. Let me know what you think. AUTOMATON PANTHER Melee Beast (Bot) Ranks : 20–30 Wound Steps : 5/4/3/2/1/1; Fatigue Steps : 5/4/3/2/1/1 Core Ability : Automaton panthers gain DR +2 on all attacks vs. unaware defenders. They also gain a +5 bonus on Perception Defense dice tests that involve the sense of smell. Beast Styles : Eviscerator, Maneater Grid : 2x2 BACKGROUND Automaton panthers have the same murky origins as their namesake cousins, the automatons. The reasons for their creation are lost to time, but they show up in much the same way. Automaton panthers awaken in far-flung, often hidden locations and wander for a time before choosing a location to call their territory. Once chosen, automaton panthers never stray from their territory and violently defend it. Pre-awakened automaton panthers are sought after and sold on the black market as guard creatures or exotic pets. ECOLOGY Automaton panthers are silent and deadly hunters, preferring to sneak up on their prey and attack from behind or above. Most automaton panthers adopt a solitary existence in their territory though, rarely, as many as six automaton panthers will form packs and wander a much larger territory than normal. A pack of automaton panthers is a terrifying foe—they wander in the open, they attack everything they come across, and they’ve even been known to run into smaller towns and tear them to pieces. Automaton panthers are sentient, need air to breathe, and need nightly rest. They don’t eat food or drink water, can’t breed, possess no genders, and feel only very basic instinctive emotions. Whatever higher intelligence their automaton cousins possess, automaton panthers have none of it beyond an advanced tactical cunning. Automaton panthers are found in every land environment on Quantum.

Should the bandit roll a Hit or better, he successfully flees combat and vanishes into nearby cover, avoiding all non-Prime methods of tracking him. If he fails, he may not choose a Combat Stance. The bandit may not use this ability if taking seven damage dots would reduce him to Exhausted, Lethargic, or Torpor.

Small update today. Spent the week tinkering with beast and foe stat blocks (as in, how to make them easier to read) and re-checking chapter 4 so that when we release it as a preview of the final book, there won't be any confusion or headaches (your confusion, my headaches). As a result, there are no changes to the status bar this week. I get a steady stream of address change messages and I want everyone to know that before the book ships (when we get there), I'll be asking each of you to confirm your address before shipping. The last thing I want to do is send your books into the black hole of mail delivery and have it vanish forever. Hold on to your address change messages for now. :-) -Josh Happy Quantum Monday, Backers! Things around Casa de Frost have been quite stressful for a while, compounded by my wife's layoff last month (and my complete lack of an income, hurray!). I'm happy to report she's gainfully employed again (hint: if you're a college student and want a job that gets you snapped off the job market faster than Percy Harvin off the waiver wire, major in accounting) and I'm back to relatively full time work on the game. There have been ... I'll call them "requests" ... for more specific updates about the game's progress. So I threw together an infographic and will update this file each week and re-post it with every update. Here's a bit about each chapter as they stand now: Chapter 1: Completely finished. Chapter 2: 78% of the writing is done and 100% of the art is in. This is by far the largest chapter in the entire book, comprising roughly 40% of the word count. Basically, it's a monster and I've been wrestling with this monster almost exclusively since the new year. Chapter 3: The writing is 100% done ... and then over-written by about 25%. A metric ass load of new gadgets and gear were added to this chapter after beta feedback and after plopping it all in, I discovered I don't have the word count for it. Once I return to this chapter, I need to either trim the words (probably by skipping descriptions on self-explanatory items) or take page count from other chapters to beef up chapter 3. Taking page count from other chapters causes enormous headaches, so I'm going to try to avoid that. 100% of the art is in for this chapter. Chapter 4: 100% of the writing is done and 100% of the art is in. Chapter 4 has been through the first editing pass and now rests with Colleen to reflow the text with edits back into the InDesign file (as this chapter has already been previously laid out--it was our test chapter for the new look of the hardcover). Once that's complete, this chapter will be released in full as a preview of the new rules changes. This is the core chapter of the book, and by getting this out early I think it'll revitalize any beta games still being played and maybe just start up some new ones. Chapter 5: Technically this chapter is 100% written, but I put 90% because I need to re-read it and make the changes from Chapter 4 apply to this chapter as well. 100% of the art is in. Chapter 6: This is a 6,000-word chapter that, while I have it outlined and partially written (about 25%), it's easily my lowest priority and will likely be written last. 100% of the art is in for this chapter. Chapter 7: This chapter is also a beast (literally). I'm about 50% of the way through the writing and 100% of the art is in. Chapter 8: This is also a huge chapter and probably the most art intensive of all of the chapters. I only have about 10% of the art in and Hugo's churning through two of the biggest files for this game right now: the rather enormous full color world map (for the tipped-in poster) and the full-page map of Akyrema City. The chapter is about 50% written, though I have all of the writing turned in from the backers whose pledges got them an opportunity to design a country. This will likely be finished second to last and I'm the most excited about getting to this one. Alas, I need to eat my vegetables (chapters 2 and 7) before I can have dessert (chapter 8). Below is the infographic. Future updates will include the infographic with updates applied to it, even if the update itself is just an art preview or rules preview. Be gentle about the infographic, I'm not a graphic designer. There's a reason writers write and graphic designers graphic design. ;-) Enjoy! -Josh Happy Quantum Monday! A quick preview this week of the delicate situation our iconic Heroes find themselves in while trying to talk a guard into looking the other way so Porphyrion, the mutant reaver, can enter the city. Clearly the guard is unimpressed. No Mutants Allowed! -Josh Evening backers! It's been a while since we've shown you any of the creations that will be found in the Beasts &amp; Foes chapter in the final Quantum Roleplaying Game hardcover. Here are eight: four beasts and four foes. The beasts are: Arthropleura : a real creature that existed on Earth ~300 million years ago Haast's Eagle : another real creature that went extinct on the South Island of New Zealand in 1400 A.D. Nanomite Swarm : a swarm of nano machines that literally devour you from the inside out Spirit Spark : a spirit of advanced technology The foes are: Campaigner : a veteran warrior of countless battles Grizzled Sergeant : a veteran leader of veteran warriors of countless battles Hedge Witch : an individual with raw, innate, shamanistic power Rioter : some men (and women) just want to watch the world burn Enjoy! See you next week! -Josh Good morning, backers! Its been a crazy week, but I'm here to tell you that the rumors of my demise were greatly ... okay, there weren't any rumors of my demise, its just been a nutty week. Today I want to talk about Space. Space has been my inspiration since I was a kid. As long as I can remember, I've obsessed over astronomy, planets, stars, galaxies, astronauts, rocket launches, and crazy guys in Red Bull spacesuits jumping from impossibly high altitudes and breaking the sound barrier on the way down. Space has influenced my taste in art, movies, and books. When I started creative writing for the first time in junior high school, I wrote about Space. (Okay, so my first short story in 8th grade was about a kid who stole money from a carnival, but that experiment ended after that and I wrote non-stop sci-fi and cyberpunk short stories until I was a sophomore in college and my creative writing instructors forced me to write other stuff too.) I'm telling you this, because this obsession with Space culminates with the Quantum Roleplaying Game and this past couple of weeks have been a GOLD MINE of space news for anyone paying attention. I can find inspiration in all of these events for the world of Quantum and future stories told there. 1. The largest single meteor blast (that we know of) since Tunguska 1908 shatters windows and injures 1,500+ people in Chelyabinsk, Russia (nicknamed Tankograd for all you WWII buffs like me). 2. One of the first space tourists (Mssr. Tito) is funding a 500+ day round trip to Mars in 2018 for one lucky married couple. The journey will take the crew within 100 km of Mars, the closest pass will be on the night side of Mars (unfortunately), and the return trip will be the first time a human crew has had to experience aerobreaking (skimming the atmosphere to slow down). Additionally, no human crew has ever hit the atmosphere at 14.2 km/second, so NASA received a grant from Tito to research and design a heat shield that keeps our first Mars tourists from burning to death on their return trip. My wife refuses, but I may have to pretend someone else is my wife and volunteer for this thing. (Sorry, love.) 3. Purely cosmic coincidence, asteroid 2012 DA14 passed within the orbit of the moon (in fact, within the orbit of most satellites) 14 hours after Chelyabinsk. Asteroid 2012 DA14 would have been a very devastating strike had it been just a hair closer (cosmically). These sorts of near misses happen frequently, but combined with the actual hit half a day earlier, 2012 DA14 reminded us with some urgency that we should probably start paying closer attention to the objects that orbit the sun that aren't planets, moons, or astronauts that HAL shot out of the airlock. 4. Mars Rover Opportunity just passed nine years on the red planet. Opportunity was expected to last just 90 days (its twin, Spirit, is now dead but also far exceeded it's original mission expectations), but is now in its 10th year. To put this in perspective, a science blog I read said to imagine that you bought a brand new car with a five year warranty and then drove that car for 180 years with zero maintenance and the car still ran just fine. That's how amazing Opportunity's life span has been. The little rover that could is now more than 20 miles from it's landing spot and even though some quirks have developed in the past decade, the crew on Earth that keeps Opportunity chugging along don't have any immediate worries the rover will stop any time soon. 5. On the other side of Mars, the Mini Cooper-sized Curiosity rover just tested its rock drill and drilled a hole into an exposed rock. At the same location, it used the mast cam to take a self portrait using 60 or so frames selectively edited to remove the mast itself. This offers a unique and very high resolution self portrait of the rover and its surrounding environment. Five really cool things in the realm of space exploration in just a matter of weeks. And all of them possess elements that could make for really good stories in Quantum. What science news are you following? And how would you apply your science interests to a Quantum RPG campaign? See you next week! Josh Happy Quantum Update Monday! Today is a quickie art preview: As the Heroes approach Akyrema City, the mutant reaver (Porphyrion) is injured and needs the human valkyrie (Taatyana) to help him walk. The automaton archer (Fin) points excitedly at the city he's never seen while the azi progenitor (Cole) waves him off in exasperation. You can see that Akyrema City is surrounded by impossibly large walls not tall enough to conceal the cloudscraper towers of the city's core. Beneath the "N" in the Quantum logo, you can see the top of the Progenancy's main building with the metal tower known as the Ladder poking from it and running all the way up to Quantum's sun, Suria (off screen, so to speak). The skies above Akyrema City are buzzing with airships and just above the middle of the wall you can see the massive waterfall that pours into the heart of the city. This image also contains clues about the Time Before—do you see them? -Josh Hey folks, I've held off long enough on this topic, time to address it. I've had two (unfortunately very public) requests for refunds on the Quantum RPG Kickstarter project. I haven't responded yet for two reasons: the requests didn't make sense to me and I needed to read and study the issue to determine an answer. The Quantum RPG Kickstarter project has 580 backers. Two of those backers want a refund. That's .3% of backers. I only include the math because the two individuals asking for a refund are doing so in a manner that's freaking out some of the other backers in other circles ("People are asking for refunds! Is the project dead!?"). While I appreciate their requests and absolutely understand their frustration, Kickstarter projects are not the same as buying a product in a store. Even Kickstarter themselves said as much recently in a blog post titled Kickstarter is Not a Store . <url>’s request for a refund unless the Project Creator is unable or unwilling to fulfill the reward. I am able and willing to fulfill the reward. The project exceeded it's Estimated Delivery Date and that's all. I'd also like to point out another blog post recently on the Kickstarter blog titled Is lateness failure? <url>"A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad.” Second, it ignores what makes Kickstarter so unique: getting to watch a project come to life. The opportunity to see how something is made and to have a hand in its creation is a special thing. If a creator turns the creative process into a story they share with backers, delays don't have to be bad news. Third, it presumes that Kickstarter is a store. Sure, it's unacceptable for a store to ship something late. But Kickstarter is not a store. The Estimated Delivery Date is the creator’s best guess at how things will go, and it’s made at a very early stage in the project’s life. I'm not willing to shortcut the quality of the project in order to push it out. It'll be done once I have all of the art in, once the chapters are fully written, fully edited (twice), and fully laid out. The day I ship the files to the printer is the day I'll be able to announce a release date. Personally, I think Kickstarter makes a huge mistake forcing project creators to put an Estimated Delivery Date on their projects and, now, they're having to post on their blog to address the grumbling about late projects since they didn't make a clear enough point (to backers) that Kickstarter is about watching the creative process on projects you like (and then getting a reward for your backing) and not about shopping in an e-store. Two final thoughts: 1. I owe you a game and weekly updates about the game as it's being worked on. You'll get what I owe you. 2. If you truly do not want your rewards when the game is finished and being shipped out to backers, I will refund your money then. I'm not a monster. One more final final thought: I'm just a guy, okay? It's just me. I'm human, I'm not perfect, I have personal life issues like everyone else, and this project has become something far larger than what was intended. I love this project. I love my backers. If you feel I've been short, angry, quiet, disheartened, or rude, it seriously makes me sad to hear it. It's never been my intent to be any of those things, especially toward my backers, and I would encourage everyone to not infer emotion via the written word. Emotion is impossible to determine sometimes online without dozens of emoticons ;-) :-) :-O :-P. I'm working. Hugo is working. The project moves closer to completion every day. Let me get it there, let me update you weekly about it, and I believe you'll love the results. Every day I see things in the game that make me excited. My enthusiasm for this project has only grown since the beginning. I owe this project to you, the backers. I owe it to you in the sense that you are owed your rewards, but also in the sense that without you, I wouldn't have been able to work on it at all at the levels Hugo and I (and Blake and Colleen and Reid and Drew and Kyle) have been able to. Thank you for backing the project. Seriously, I love you guys. #Cartman -Josh Happy Quantum Monday, backers! Today I'm going to talk about where the Quantum RPG is headed after the core rulebook releases. This was one of the requested topics when I asked a few weeks back on my author Facebook page and on the Infinite X Studio Facebook page and I've heard a few people worry aloud that Quantum won't be more than just a single book. Time to address all of those things. My very first instinct was to follow the path of many RPGs before and release an iconic adventure as the first product after the core rulebook. Instead, I went against that instinct and tried the failed Kickstarter for Akyrema City: Quantum's Core. In hindsight, a bad idea all around. So I'm now firmly back on my instinct: the first product after the Quantum RPG core rulebook will be an iconic adventure called Singularity . It will explore multiple locations around the world and offer up roleplaying and combat scenes that I consider iconic to the setting. I'm not sure quite yet if this is a mega-adventure format (96+ pages) or something closer to a one- or two-session adventure clocking in around 32 pages. Over the years in the hobby industry, I've learned the conventional wisdom that Adventures Don't Sell. The exception to that wisdom seems to almost always be the first one: it sells so folks can get a better sense of the world through play experience and then, typically, the follow-up adventures either sell poorly or, sadly, not at all. I don't want to build the Quantum RPG backbone on products that, in my experience, are poor sellers (or simply unpopular). So the plan after the adventure is to release everybody's favorite accessory: a monster book! Entitled Book of Beasts, Vol 1 , Quantum's first beast book will add 256 additional pages of beasts and foes, including rules for designing your own. After that, the Akyrema City: Quantum's Core book is planned as are a massive Quantum atlas, a book that expands all of the Paradigms and races (and includes rules for creating your own), and then perhaps another Beast book etc etc. I'm assigning no dates to any of these until they're ready and plans can shift and change so I won't guarantee any of these, though I will say I'm excited about all of them. What do you want to see? Once you've got a couple of copies of the Quantum RPG in your hands, where would you like to see the game go? See you next week! Josh Happy Quantum Update M̷o̷n̷d̷a̷y̷ Wednesday! Crazy week! Sorry for the delay. Like sands through the hour glass, these are the Other Paradigms (of our lives) ... The Other Paradigms (Part 2 of 2) As I said in Part 1, the beta contained six Paradigms that I considered to be "core concept" Paradigms. Core concept means that while all Paradigms function differently aesthetically, the mechanics of how every Paradigm functions can be beta-tested via six Paradigms rather than all 17. The beta covered the archer, progenitor, reaver, shaman, valkyrie, and warlock. Part 1 covered the corsair, crusader, generalist, hunter, and immortal. Here's a little bit about the final seven: Myrmidon The myrmidon is an incredibly brave melee fighter who relies on his enhanced Sanity Defense and skill with spear and shield to get in close and fight beasts or foes who could easily frighten away lesser Paradigms. Many myrmidons can use 2H spears 1H so long as they wield a shield in the off hand. The myrmidon can choose from Styles like hoplite (a 2H spear + shield fighting style), javelineer, valiant (a new Stance), and veteran. Necromancer The necromancer is one of the more terrifying paradigms. She views dead things—such as dead animals or dead humans—as simple material tools that can be used as easily as a hammer or a sword. She's an accepted Paradigm among the ranks of Heroes on Quantum, but her obsessions tend to push her to the fringe of society. The necromancer can choose from Styles like corrosimancer, mortui scientiae (probing the minds of the deceased for information), psychomancer, and reanimator. Sage The sage is a straight-forward scientific healer. He's just as likely found in a clinic in a major city as he is on the road with a Fellowship of Heroes. There's very little art in the healing prowess of the sage—his skills come from thousands of hours of careful study, examination, and practice. The sage can choose from Styles like churgeon, enermancer, philosopher, or watcher (a new Stance). Shaman The shaman is as much a healer as the previously discussed sage, but she prefers to practice her medicine and healing in the Wilds between the cities. She believes the urban life to be among the causes of disease and despair and lives a casual and simple life healing and treating the rural villagers who are among the more destitute people on Quantum. The shaman can choose from styles such as ferocimancer, herbalist (making potions and salves), prophet (a new Stance), and Suria invoker (summoning terrifying sun-infused spirits). Slayer The hunter roams the wilderness and lives off the land—the slayer roams Quantum and hunts down and destroys specific types of beasts. He begins play with a chosen beast type and over time he improves his abilities to seek out and destroy dangerous beasts of that type. Eventually he can also broaden his abilities to additional beast types, improving his abilities versus them as well. Troubadour The troubadour was trained from birth to be two things: a court performer (poet, actor, musician, comedian) and a spy. Troubadours as a whole collect information from their various courts and pass them back to their training school where the information is collated, studied, and sold to the highest bidder. Troubadours are secretive, smart, and stylish. The troubadour can choose from Styles like creator adept (he can learn exomancy or esomancy equations but takes physical wound damage dots when performing them), poisoner, sleeper, and strange blade (the art of dealing wound damage unseen). Warrior The warrior is the classic combatant clad in shining armor, wielding a shield and sharpened sword, while slicing and bashing his way through the battlefield. His core ability revolves around a simple taunt mechanic that unintelligent foes can't resist and intelligent foes resist with their Sanity Defense. The warrior can choose from Styles such as dragoon, guardian (a new Stance), shield master, and zweihander. See you next week! -Josh Happy Quantum update Monday, backers! We'll continue last week's two-part post next week—today we talk about what changed from Quantum's beta version to the final version being worked on right now. A lot of the changes were cosmetic: trimming the names for things, adjusting the flow of information, and so on. Examples for both include Combat Stances are now called Stances and the entire Hero creation section was re-written and re-organized for clarity. More complicated changes include: 1. The dice test table was removed entirely and the method for determining success was simplified. Since the table had a simple math formula behind it, that same simple math formula could be applied as a bonus to a die roll instead. Rather than finding your step, rolling the d100, and consulting the step for the result type (Hit, Miss, or Ace), you instead now add together all of the bonuses and penalties to the roll to determine a modifier and add/subtract that modifier to/from a d100 roll. If you roll 50 or higher, it's a Hit. If you roll 100 or higher, it's an Ace. 2. The armor traits that reduced specific damage types and the weapon traits that reduced certain armor types were removed. They were unnecessarily complex in a system that strives to be simple and after running into them as road blocks during playtesting rather than calculating them as added flavor, I decided the entire system needed to go. All of the armor and weapon statistics were adjusted instead, to create additional differences between each weapon and armor set and to bring down the prices of many of the more common items. 3. The amount of money gained at Hero creation was increased and every Hero begins play with a set of basic clothing and either a knife or a club (choose one). This should address issues at Hero creation with Paradigms that require more expensive weapons (archer, hunter, etc) being able to start with at least a basic version of their required weapon. 4. The gear section of Chapter 3 was massively expanded to include many additional common items and a few new Quantum-specific items. So there you have it: some things to think about as we finish the game and you continue to play Quantum with the beta. Until next week! Josh Happy Quantum Update Monday! This past week I asked over on my Facebook author page and on the Infinite X Studio Facebook page what folks would like to see previewed or further explained in the next few updates. These were the requests: * Info about the Paradigms not in the beta that will be in the final game. * What changed from the beta to the final game? * Character creation. * Future products supporting the game. * A schedule of how I will travel the world to Guide the game for everyone (thanks, Ben!). That looks like a healthy request list. Why don't I just tackle them in order, one update at a time? The Other Paradigms (Part 1 of 2) The beta contained six Paradigms that I considered to be "core concept" Paradigms. Core concept means that while all Paradigms function differently aesthetically , the mechanics of how every Paradigm functions can be beta-tested via six Paradigms rather than all 17. The beta covered the archer, progenitor, reaver, shaman, valkyrie, and warlock. Here's a little bit about the rest: Corsair The corsair is a mobile fighter who relies on her expertise with small weapons and her knack of staying on her feet in a fight no matter how much the deck (ground, floor, etc) shifts beneath her. She can choose from Styles like anchor (a new Stance), duelist, navigator, and swashbuckler. Crusader The crusader fights a daily battle to keep the Void at bay, sacrificing his physical stamina to protect those around him. He can choose from Styles like gloom scholar, lightbringer, shadow guard (a new Stance), and turnabout. Generalist You know the generalist by his many other names: jack-of-all-trades, expert, renaissance man, know-it-all. The generalist has a free hand determining his Styles, though he's restricted from many Styles considered exclusive to their associated Paradigms. The generalist cannot be an esomancer or an exomancer, but he can learn enchantment equations if he chooses Prime as his root damage scale. Hunter Great with ranged weapons and an expert of all things wilderness, the hunter roams The Wilds between Quantum's urban centers surviving off the land and putting down the occasional beast that gets in her way. She's rarely far from her war dog, a highly trained companion that serves the hunter as a loyal friend, guardian, and tracker. She can choose from Styles like companion (improves her war dog), predator, survivor, and trapper. Immortal An immortal is "created" through a months-long process that is as arduous as it is horrifically painful—very few who submit to the process survive it. The immortal is forbidden to use melee or ranged weapons (he can't even hold one in his hands or carry one on his person) and so trains constantly to hone his hand-to-hand fighting skills. He heals faster than normal and can't be killed unless his brain (or CPU if he's an automaton) is removed completely and burned to ashes. (This is the only known way to increase the lifespan of an automaton and the Immortals who know the secrets to the process aren't talking.) He can choose from Styles like athlete, bodyguard, fearless, and grappler. End of Part 1. Part 2 features the myrmidon, necromancer, sage, slayer, troubadour, and warrior. -Josh Howdy folks! First: large apologies for a month of silence. Not cool on my part and I own that and apologize. Personal issues got in the way of most everything, but work hasn't stopped. The game progresses and I've put three new art previews below that I'll explain in a moment. I'm not a huge fan of New Year's resolutions, but I'm going to make one and keep it: every Monday from now until the game is at the printer will be Quantum Update Monday. You will get one update per week every week on Monday* minimum guaranteed. Nothing raises anxiety over a project you're dedicated to than hearing nothing about that project for extended periods of time and that's going to stop now. On to the art! Hugo has been pumping out art on a regular basis for the last month now trying desperately to clear his end of this project. You might think working faster means the work is diminished but this is definitely not the case with Mr. Solis. His work, if anything, gets better! I've seen a lot of pieces since before the holidays and what I'm struck by repeatedly is the idea that he's very clearly got an idea for how all this stuff looks and it looks amazing. The first art piece features our iconic Progenitor back-to-back with our iconic Archer in a bar brawl. I absolutely love the visualizations Hugo gives to Omnimancy—I knew it needed to look different than your average fantasy RPG magic system and I conveyed that to Hugo and trusted him to make it different but fun. I think he has. What say you? The second art piece features the four primary iconics (Progenitor, Archer, Valkyrie, and Reaver) battling two automaton panthers. Again, notice how Hugo is defining the look of Omnimancy as the Progenitor performs an Omnimancy Equation that pulls the leaping automaton panther apart. Brilliant. The final art piece for today's preview is your first on the ground look at Akyrema City. Notice the blend of old world classic architecture and crazy futuristic stylings. This was my art order verbatim for this scene: "This is a bustling street scene. Everyone is clean. The iconics should stand out like sore thumbs here—they are dirty and road weary. Glass buildings, modern-looking streets, street lights. The focus is on the difference between the battered iconics and the clean city." I'm working with Hugo on this project because he can take a rather meager art order description like that and turn it into something amazing. Until next Monday! -Josh * Pacific Time (usually A.M.) Good evening, backers! Today's preview is a two-for: First up is the chapter header art. One of the suggestions we received during the beta was that the final book needed some fiction to help bring the world to life. I wasn't interested in dumping page count for thousands of words of fiction, but I did really like the idea of adding fiction to the visual story being told throughout the half-page art pieces in the book. To that end, every chapter starts with a half-page piece of awesome Hugo Solis art and a little 150-word fiction burst attached to that image. In a previous update (and again in this one) we featured the half-page art from Chapter 1. Now I'll show off the fiction that goes with it! ---------- “If it matters to anyone,” Cole said in her deadpan monotone, “I fixed the engine.” “Amazing work,” snarled Porphyrion as he helped Fin to stand. “If you’re going to wait that long to do something helpful next time, jump overboard instead.” “Shut up!” yelled Taatyana, her weapons drawn. “That dragon’s not dead—she’s pissed off. Get Fin up so we can move out.” Porphyrion grabbed Fin and brushed scorch marks off the automaton’s metal exterior. “Thank you, Porphyrion,” Fin said, his voice its usual perfect crispness. He turned to Taatyana. “I suggest we walk to the next town, boss. If my reading of the coastline as we plummeted toward it was correct, we’re just outside one of Akyrema City’s outer suburbs. We can be there before nightfall.” “Out of the three of you, why is the robot the only useful one?” said Taatyana. “No offense, old man.” Fin tilted his head to the side and said, “None taken, meat bag.” ---------- I hope you enjoyed that! The second preview is the final Example of Play text in Chapter 1. Read through it and see if you can spot any of the rules changes post-beta. Enjoy! ---------- EXAMPLE OF PLAY Below is an example of a scene with a Guide and her four players: Ryan, Jessica, Emily, and Ben. Guide : You enter a crowded pub in Akyrema City, the smell of alcohol and the sound of laughter filling your senses. What do you do? Ryan (progenitor): I look around the pub. Do I see our contact? Guide : You see him in the far corner, a hood pulled down over most of his face. Jessica (valkyrie): I start pushing through the crowd, shouting, “Make way, lads!” Emily (archer): I follow Jessica. Ben (reaver): I stay near the door. Guide : Ryan, Jessica, and Emily, you make your way to the table with very little trouble. Ben, what is your Perception Defense? Ben : My Perception Defense is six. Guide : Someone is watching you, but he’s trying to do so stealthily. His Agility + Stealth is 10, your Perception Defense is six, so his total modifier is +4. [rolls d100] He rolls 35, a Miss. You easily spot a man at the bar intently watching you and your friends. Ben : I keep an eye on him and an eye on the front door. Guide : Take a –5 penalty to your Perception Defense since you’re splitting your attention between the door and the bar. Ben : Got it. Guide : Jessica, Emily, and Ben—what are you up to? Jessica : I approach our contact and say the passphrase: “Suria shines in the morning.” Guide : Your contact gestures for you to sit. There are two other seats. Ryan : I’ll stand and watch the crowd, my back to the table. Jessica : I sit down. Emily : Me too! Guide : As soon as you sit down, your contact pulls back the hood of his cloak. But it’s not a man: it’s a human woman. She says, “Obviously I’m not your contact—he was a trap.” Jessica : I draw my Spark pistol, but keep it under the table. Ryan : Did I hear the human woman say that? Guide : No, it’s much too loud and you have your back turned. Emily : I reach back and tug on Ryan’s sleeve. Guide : Just as you do, there’s a loud crash from the front door! Ben : What do I see? Guide : The door is kicked open and two male mutants stand there, axes ready. All four of you hear the door crash open—you can see the two mutants, but I need you all to call out your Perception Defenses. Jessica : 8! Ryan : 3! Emily : 2! Ben : With the –5 penalty, my Perception Defense is 1. Guide (rolls several d100 rolls): Ben, you see the man at the bar stand up and draw an axe from under his cloak. Jessica, you see that man and another one step out from the nearby shadows with an axe. Ryan, you see the man at the bar but not the man in the shadows. Emily, you’re oblivious to any foes other than the two mutants at the door. Initiative time! [ The Guide determines the order of action by Initiative ] Guide : Ben, you go first! Ben : I draw my axe and move to block the door! Guide : Remember to write down your Stance, Ben. Next is the guy at the bar—he raises his axe and screams, “Leave the pub now or die!” and moves three meters toward the table. Jessica! Jessica : I stand with a Free Action and point my Spark pistol at the man in the shadows. I fire as an Attack Tactic. Guide : Your Spark pistol roars! Perform a Combat Test, Agility + Spark Pistols. His Dodge Defense is four. Jessica : My Agility + Spark Pistols is 10, so I subtract his Dodge Defense and get a modifier of +6 on my roll. [rolls d100] I rolled 67 on the dice for a total of 73—a Hit! Guide : [rolls for the defender]: Excellent shot! What’s the Spark pistol’s DR? Jessica : Nine. Guide : His AR is five—he takes four dots of wound damage. And so on. Each player directs his or her Hero during the scene, and the Guide directs the flow of combat and controls the human woman (an ally) as well as the four mutant males with axes (assassins sent to stop the Heroes). Combat continues until one side wins or one side flees. Hello backers! Today I've decided to pull the plug on the beta. After thousands of downloads, hundreds of feedback posts, and dozens of hours reviewing and taking note of potential changes, the beta has served its purpose. We're well on our way with the final book with final writing being cleared daily and editing and layout in progress on several chapters already. The beta will remain available for download until the final book's PDF is released, but the time to provide feedback is over. As I get final edits back, I'll be previewing changes (including the whole of Chapter 4: Challenges &amp; Combat) that were made to the final game after the 3-1/2 month long beta. I personally think the changes have made the game infinitely better and those changes wouldn't have been possible without the excellent feedback we received. We're also beating the last art needs out of Hugo Solis and so I thought I'd put an art preview up today. This is the first piece of 1/2 page Chapter intro art in the book and continues the story established on the cover with our iconic Heroes battling the dragon. In this piece, we see the ship has crashed and our Heroes are trying to pull themselves together to flee the crash sight before the dragon returns. Enjoy! Joshua J. Frost President/Owner Infinite X Studio, LLC Hello! I'm incredibly proud to bring you the final cover art for the Quantum Roleplaying Game. In a few days we'll bring you another preview of the art, but this time plugged into the final cover with logos and graphic design. One of our layout theories for the core rulebook is that every piece of half-page art is a scene in a continuous story. That story begins on the cover. Our Heroes—automaton archer Fin, azi progenitor Cole, mutant reaver Porphyrion, and human valkyrie Taatyana—are on their way to Akyrema City so Cole can deliver a secretive device to her bosses at The Progenancy. Before they reach their destination, however, they blunder into the territory of a dragon who makes short work of the airship's crew and the archer, reaver, and valkyrie fight valiantly to keep the dragon from doing further damage to the ship while the progenitor stretches the bounds of her Equations to keep the ship from immediately falling from the sky. Will they succeed? You'll find out inside. :-) Enjoy! Hey folks! Quick update here: I've been sick as a dog for a week now and buried in work before that, so my apologies for being so quiet this month. Final art is coming in fast this week (and hopefully all of it will be in soon). Chapter 4 is still in edit, but it's otherwise complete and I still hope to get it out for preview as soon as possible so everyone can see the changes from the beta as they apply to the core chapter of the book. As for the beta, it continues to be a resounding success. Thousands of downloads and hundreds of solid feedback posts that I've spent this month collating and applying to the rules. Overall, I'm absolutely thrilled with the response from the beta. Couldn't be happier. I've been quiet on the boards for the above reasons and because the beta feedback has slowed to a trickle, so I'm focused on applying the beta feedback to the rules and pushing through all of the final chapters. We're progressing slowly, but progressing nonetheless. Take care, Josh Attention Backers!

While I reserve this right, I'm an adventurous individual and I doubt I'll refuse. We may have to game in an adjacent country though. ;-) Ask and ye shall receive! I've had a lot of requests in the past weeks for additional information about the world of Quantum itself (as opposed to the rules themselves). This post contains a general overview of the Twelve Nations, the Progenancy, Akyrema City, and the Wilds. Also, you'll find the incredibly rough map we sent out to the authors of the nations as reference. The final world map will, of course, look much cooler. Enjoy! As a friendly reminder, we're still running the Akyrema City Kickstarter . We have 21 days to go and we're 19% funded. Please consider backing Akyrema City—we can't do it without your support. :-) The Twelve Nations Ackarian Confederacy (Nation #7) Spires at War Government : Confederate Oligarchy Demonym : Ackarian Most Ackarians today believe their nation was founded by refugees of tyranny and persecution in a foreign land, most likely Thuleizan. Over time, the Ackarian cities and townships that sprang up all across the lowlands and mountainous regions west of Malsurvia, bonded together in a single Confederacy of free people typically ruled at the local level by oligarchs. The region flourished for many centuries with hundreds of thousands of azi, automaton, and human settlers streaming in to escape war, poverty, or famine by establishing new townships with new ideas about governance. Twenty years ago, a mysterious device from the Time Before was discovered on the then border between the Ackarian Confederacy and Malsurvia. Both nations spent a great deal of time trying to uncover its purpose before the Progenancy could swoop in and remove it. They hoped, naively, that it might be some new power source or a weapon to overthrow the Progenancy's world control. Whatever it was, will never be known, however, as the device exploded after a few weeks of study killing thousands and wiping several Ackarian and Malsurvian towns off the map. Both nations began fighting to alter their borders to encompass as much of the blast area as possible—hoping to discern the device's purpose from the wreckage—and today there exists a partial wasteland between both called the Disputed Lands where few make their homes, but where two nations have made 20 years of war. Arachosia Subjugated Vassal State Government : Consular Republican Vassalage Demonym : Arachosian Arachosia is laden with natural resources and technological ruins from the Time Before. It's a human-controlled state well-connected by Spark train running from the main continent down the peninsula to Akyrema City. It's "ruled" by a seven-member council that can only make decisions on a 4-3 or better majority. There's also a Public Assembly filled with random citizens randomly selected for a one year term. Neither the ruling council nor the PA have any real power as the Progenancy rules Arachosia. Arachosia is peaceful, the next most "modern" state on Quantum outside of Akyrema City (though it's still rather medieval by today's standards), and it stays out of the world's political affairs unless the Progenancy says otherwise. Damavand Severed Sovereignty Government : ??? Demonym : Damavandi Damavand was once a mighty technocracy, ruled by a scientific elite and standing in constant opposition to the Progenancy's assertion of dominance over all of the technologies of Quantum. The might of Damavand crested in 830 when the nation formally demanded the Progenancy release every word of it's technological secrets to every government of the world. When the Progenancy refused, Damavand built a multi-nation army and marched on Akyrema City, only to be nearly annihilated by the city's ultra-modern defenses. This silenced Damavand for a time, but in the spring of 834, the willful technocracy once again demanded the Progenancy's secrets—this time, however, they claimed to have possession of a Time Before super weapon that they'd use to "erase Akyrema City from existence" if their demands weren't met. That summer, the Progenancy proved it's authority when it disconnected the entire nation of Damavand from the Prime Source, plunging the once mighty technocracy into darkness and chaos. Today, Damavand is a mystery. The things that live there occasionally scream forth into The Shrieking Wilds, a no man's land patrolled by Malsurvia. The Malsurvians who speak of their encounters with the denizens of Damavand (and there are very few of those) describe pitiful, violent, half-human terrors that beg for death while screaming for human flesh. No one who enters Damavand is ever seen again. Free Cities of Kadjar (Nation #12) United Against Tyranny Government : Assembled Council of City States Demonym : Kadjariot On a map, the Free Cities of Kadjar seem distant from the other civilized nations, cut off by land mass or ocean. In reality, they are just below (or above) Akyrema City, a nearly straight line up and away from the Free Cities, past Suria, and back down to Quantum's Core. The Free Cities are four allied city states—Anchor's Landing, Avesta, Diamond Springs, and Fort Barricade—and their associated vassal cities, towns, and farming communities founded by an azi named Quintus I in the year 14 by uniting once warring city states into a single front against barbarism and piracy. Each city state sends one representative to a council in Avesta and the ruler of the council—called the Kadjar—rotates between each state every five years. For nearly a thousand years this system has allowed the Free Cities to grow, prosper, and remain largely peaceful. An interesting feature within the borders of the Free Cities is a region that borders with the Venom Strand. Called the Razi Tar Pits, it's a swampy, vegetation-thick wasteland filled with thousands of bubbling tar pools. The tar itself is tinged blue and the chemical smell it gives off causes breathing trouble and even death for those not prepared. Before the Progenancy asserted its complete control of the region, scientists, explorers, and archaeologists from the Free Cities found hundreds of technological secrets from the time before throughout the Razi Tar Pits and today it remains an enticing target for the brave and foolhardy willing to risk the Progenancy's security to sneak into the region and search for dangerously buried treasure. Kadru (Nation #8) Cradle of the Azi Government : Loosely Affiliated Democracy Demonym : Kadric Kadru is a nation built on gathering, sharing, and trading information with the rest of Quantum. It's culture has long been steeped in traditions of scholarship and discipline and its known the world over as a land of vast libraries, prosperous trade and agriculture, safe trade routes, and immaculately clean cities. Nearly 40% of the nation's population are azi and most azi on Quantum believe their species began at a location in Kadru called Ora Mountain. Kadru is mostly comprised of small communities run by locally elected volunteers. Kadru's capital, Astikua, is the home to Oracular Council—an assembly comprised of local representatives from across the nation—and to the vast forested campuses of the Jongleur—an academy of colleges devoted to training Quantum's best Troubadours. While rumors abound that the Jongleur is nothing more than a front for an army of trained spies, the Jongleur's First Chair Aiden Skroding laughs that off as the delusional imaginings of talentless former students. Malsurvia (Nation #9) Beset by Battle Government : Oligarchy Demonym : Malsurvian Malsurvia is a nation surrounded by violent struggle. To the east are the Shrieking Wilds, filled with all manner of terrors that continue to spring forth from doomed Damavand. To the west, Malsurvia is at war with the Ackarian Confederacy, a war they were once clearly winning but with their military resources split between the two conflicts, Malsurvia may have to admit soon that they are slowly losing. Malsurvia's original capital, Roembek, now lies abandoned in the Disputed Lands, partially reduced to rubble by the explosion that started the war and then emptied by constant warfare along its once broad and beautiful paved streets. Though the fighting stays mainly to semi-permanent lines at both fronts, the interior villages and towns of Malsurvia feel the pressures of warfare as they must work to provide the nation and its soldiers with weapons, armor, food, salt, wagons, and so on. With most of the strong and hardy men and women fighting at the front, the young and old are usually the only ones left in the interior towns and this has made them frequent targets of banditry. Years of such attacks, though, have made it common practice for weapon training to begin at a very young age for all of the children of Malsurvia and the elderly never balk at the idea of grabbing a shield and spear and spilling raider blood in the dirt. Republic of Aranam (Nation #5) Ruled by Amnesia Government : Republican Meritocracy Demonym : Aranamite The Republic of Aranam is the youngest nation on Quantum, formed just over a century ago when feuding city states finally set aside their century's old differences and united under a single political, economic, and military ideology. The people of Aranam are fiercely proud of their young nation and, indeed, it's economic power on the world stage has grown every year since its founding. The leaders of Aranam credit the people with this growth—the people credit the Veil. The Veil is a bizarre piece of Time Before technology that possesses the ability to remove specific memories and knowledge from the mind. Housed inside a Progenancy Outpost on Mt. Veratha (where it was discovered), the room-sized Veil created a national government free of bias and self-interest. Once chosen for office by the bureaucracy, a citizen soon-to-be Governor of the Council is taken to the Progenancy Outpost where the bureaucracy subjects him to the Veil's power and turns him into the perfect politician. Thereafter, he spends his days of service building only the nation's political, economic, and military might and not lining his pockets with graft. Not everything's perfect in Aranam, however. The bureaucracy grows increasingly paranoid as of late that rival nations are planting spies throughout the country set on bringing down Aranam's growing power. A violent, fledgling secret police took hold in the last decade and they search the country from border to border constantly, finding and removing anyone suspected of spying. The citizens of the republic grumble quietly about these developments, but so long as their amnestic government continues to make life better for everyone not in the custody of the secret police, they don't grumble too loud or too often. Rudriya (Nation #11) Unitary Xenophobes Government : Secretocracy Demonym : Rudrudian Rudriya is a human-centric, highly-xenophobic society. Non citizens are allowed in only with an official government guide called a Shepherd. Being caught illegally in Rudriya results swiftly in punishments ranging from permanent expulsion to death. Rumors abound that Rudriya's xenophobia comes from the nation's secretive ruling authority called Control, who are—the rumors say—conducting genetic experiments on the citizenry, holding on to a secret cache of weapons from the Time Before, building an army to challenge the Progenancy, or a nation of slaves ruled by the Void. Even among the citizens of Rudriya, these rumors are known, but none dare utter them publicly should any Shepherds hear it and report the rumormongering to Control. Sovereign Principality of Deska (Nation #3) Chivalry and Honor Government : Feudal Monarchy Demonym : Deskan Named after Deska, known to all in the sovereign realm as the First Knight, this nation is a land of chivalry and honor with the precepts of the First Knight followed unquestioningly. Knights are taught from birth that to befoul one's honor brings shame on the knight, the knight's family, all of Deska, and on the memory of the First Knight herself. Since the First Knight, though, the definition of honor has changed and with each barony fielding its own knightly order, the precepts have as many interpretations as there are barons. Deska is ruled by a Crown Prince who sits on the throne in Haryma. There are five baronies, each of whom have sworn fealty to the Prince, and each of whom teaches a radically different view of the precepts. These radically different views have resulted in radically different ideas of what "fealty" means as several of the baronies actively work against their sovereign and at least one has tried to kill him. Sulstan (Nation #6) Founded by Order Government : Consular Plutocracy Demonym : Sulstanite Sulstan was founded by one of the first known awakened automatons less than 20 years after the incident that ended the Time Before. The automaton's name is lost to history, but many believe it was likely something similar to the nation's current name, since morphed into "Sulstan" over a millennia. The Founder's greatest legacy was not his name, however, it was his legendary rebuilding and reactivation of the Grand Vats, a Time Before technology that produces massive quantities of protein-rich fungus (known today as "slab") that kept the first citizens of Sulstan from starving to death and is the nation's primary food export today. Though the Progenancy now manages and guards the Grand Vats, they've never attempted to halt its operations. The public believes this is because the Progenancy would have instantaneous world-wide resistance on their hands were the Progenancy to cut off a massive source of food, but some believe it to be a more sinister reason: Sulstan's ruling party, the Prime Order, is a puppet of the Progenancy. Whether or not it's true that the Progenancy secretly controls Sulstan via the Prime Order is of no consequence to most Sulstanites, but those who believe this idea to be true are among the leaders of the resistance movement quietly but actively pushing back against the Progenancy's stranglehold on Time Before technology worldwide. Thuleizan (Nation #10) Humanity's Imperium Government : Kratocracy Demonym : Thule or Imperial The Imperium was built within the ruins of a great nation from the Time Before that the Thules call the Ancients. The Thules rebuilt the roads, rediscovered the Spark Trains, rediscovered and advanced electric lighting, and adopted methods from the Time Before to handle water supplies and waste disposal. Their population centers are rigid and ordered with monolithic architecture and a firm foundation of nationalistic (some would say xenophobic) pride. Thules tend to be among the most racist humans on Quantum—they despise and murder mutants, distrust azi, claim the allegiance of all of humanity, and mockingly refuse to admit that automatons are alive in any sense (frequently calling them pejoratives like toy and robot). The nation is ruled by one party, called Red Hand, and their iconography is everywhere—draped from the sides of government buildings, hanging as shields from pillars and posts, emblazoned on the front of military and police uniforms, and even stamped on every export. It's taboo in the Imperium to participate in any anti-government activities and though not strictly illegal, Red Hand ignores public shaming of such organizations all the way up to outright murder, most of which is carried out by Red Hand's loosely affiliated gang of nationalistic thugs known simply as Crimson. The nation is broken into several regional territories each ruled by a Red Hand appointed Regent who in turn appoints district, county, municipal, and neighborhood leaders in order to maintain Red Hand's strict authority. Corruption is rampant but conducted in secret—publicly-discovered corruption is punished by swift execution lest the people come to believe Red Hand is morally bankrupt and attempt to subvert their authority. Zurvan Protectorates (Nation #4) Quantum's Purse Government: Plutocracy Demonym: Zurvan The Zurvan Protectorates lie atop the dry and hellishly hot Daivam Plateau at the heart of a trade network that spans seven of Quantum's nations. Easily the largest economic power outside of Akyrema City, Zurvan trade envoys can be found in every major city on Quantum. The envoys make sure all Zurvan trade goods coming into and out of their assigned city are accurately monitored and on schedule and each envoy employs hundreds of Zurvan mercenaries—collectively called Gorra—who travel with Zurvan merchant caravans and trade envoys, making Zurvan trade routes among the hardest on Quantum to pillage. The average citizen of the Zurvan Protectorates lives a life of relative comfort compared to the average citizen of the other nations. Education is free, water is abundant thanks to borrowed technologies of the Progenancy and despite the desert heat, crime is rare, and work is plentiful and well-payed. There's a trade-off for this comfort however—Zurvan is comprised of a strict caste system and citizens are considered the highest tier. Beneath citizens are two more castes: soldiers and slaves. Neither of the lower castes can ever hope to reach the citizen caste (though slaves can become soldiers) and they possess very little of the rights and benefits of Zuran citizens. Soldiers have some freedoms, but are indebted to a life of service either as a Gorra or as a Zurvan military soldier or officer. Slaves handle all of the manual labor, live a harsh and often short life, and generally exist invisible in Zuran society, neither interacting with citizens nor being acknowledged by them. Among citizens, it's taboo to even discuss the life of a slave or to admit to owning any—it's something the citizens would rather pretend doesn't exist. As of late, ancient rumors of Zurvans controlling a Time Before technology that accurately predicts trade models and is thus the secret to their economic success have reached another apex with dozens of teams of Progenitors scouring the country to find such a device. Should such a device exist, it would likely put the nation of tradespeople on a bad footing with the Progenancy, but after years of searching with no results, it's likely just a rumor started by a rival trade nation. The Progenancy The 13th Nation Government : Technocratic Hegemony Demonym : Progenitor The Progenancy is a tightly controlled, rigid organization of scientists and scholars who believe that controlling all of the technologies from the Time Before is the only way to prevent another world-spanning catastrophe. Founded in the remnants of Akyrema City immediately following the events that ended the Time Before, the humans and azi who banded together beneath this protectionist ideology did so knowing the greedy expansion of knowledge and power from the Time Before could not be suffered to live again on Quantum. Over the years they built Akyrema City back into and beyond the shining city it was in the Time Before, and through clever political manipulation and the outright destruction of Damavand, now sit as the de facto heads of every world government. No technology may be kept from the roaming Progenitors, no remnants of the Time Before hidden away as secrets. The Progenitors know more about the Time Before and the technology it birthed than anyone else on Quantum, but even they will admit they know a small percentage of what once was. So they adventure frequently from their base at the heart of Akyrema City and from the hundreds of Progenancy Outposts all across the nations of Quantum, ranks of Progenitors—adventuring scholars and archaeologists—collecting tech in any way possible to fulfill the mandate of their hegemony: no tech left behind. Akyrema City Quantum's Core Government : Technocracy Demonym : Akyreman Akyrema City is all that's left from the Time Before, the world of Quantum as it was before the terrible apocalypse a millennium ago. It's a shining city crammed full of ultra modern, sleek, futuristic design and technology. It's not out of place to see a medieval knight in full plate armor atop an armored steed pushing through the well-dressed crowds on a concrete lane, a dozen floating video screens floating above screaming the latest news and advertising. Akyrema City is the core of Quantum; the beating heart of an entire world struggling to rebuild. It's also the base of the Progenancy, the world-spanning, highly regimented organization self-tasked with gathering and controlling all remnants of Spark, the future technologies from the Time Before. Akyrema City is the source of Quantum's commerce, government, and technology—and the base from which a thousand adventures a year are launched, sending Quantum's Heroes into The Wilds in search of fame and fortune. The Wilds Everything beyond the Twelve Nations and Akyrema City is known as The Wilds. What these places actually are, though, varies dramatically. There are regions—such as Ten Harbors, the Free People of the Kopernik Protocol, the Domain of the Hirovuti Clans, and the Holdfasts of the Dahaka Reavers—that are actually well-populated, but not bound together in what civilized Quantum would call nations. There are other places—like Azrikam, The Venom Strands, Solvay Char, and The Remnants of Old Padirac—that are essentially enormous ruined monuments to the nations that once existed there, now overgrown and crumbling but still capable of revealing wonders from the Time Before. Finally, there are regions—such as The Savage Plains, The Shrieking Wilds, the Disputed Lands, Lake Boyle, the Pygmy Deep, and the Apollyon Deep—where danger and savagery lie around every corner. There you might find armies battling for dominance, tribes of insane warriors pillaging all in their path, unnamed horrors from the Void roaming free and unchecked, or ruinous landscapes incapable of supporting any life at all. The Wilds are avoided by the Twelve Nations for a reasons—all of the wild places of Quantum share a common disregard for the well-being of those who would call themselves civilized.

I've received several avenues of feedback from the Quantum RPG audience and it's clear I need to be more clear on the timing of the new Kickstarter project. Many people have expressed confusion about seeing a new Kickstarter when the first hasn't been delivered—this is a concern I hold as well and a concern I knew would come up. There are several factors in play as to why we chose now to launch the Akyrema City Kickstarter: We are in the closing phases of the Quantum RPG core rulebook project. The first chapters are heading off to the contract editor, final art is coming in from the contract artist, and Colleen (our full time Production Manager) is preparing the final layout. The Beta has been very successful, going beyond even what I expected, and the feedback has resulted in several changes to the game that make it even better. A few of you have pointed out that the Quantum RPG was due on April 2012. While that is what is says under each pledge, I really wish it wasn't there. When we launched last year, I thought the Quantum RPG Kickstarter would be a small vanity project I could work on for a while and release. When we hit 360% of our goal, everything changed. I had to build a company AND a game at the same time. So I did. Unfortunately, Kickstarter won't let you edit the pledges so I couldn't change the date—if I could've changed the date, I would've set it for a year later, December 2012. I couldn't and so the perception looms that I'm late on the first and for that I apologize. Since we're entering the final phase of production on the first book, and since we're an actual company now with employees and contractors who all need to be paid, the only logical step for us scheduling-wise was to go ahead and launch the next Kickstarter. It funds in a month. A month from now we should be very close to sending the files in to the printer. There's a one week delay after the files are in as we and the printer make sure everything is okay. Then there's another delay of six weeks as the books are printed and shipped to us. Then add another week for us to ship the books to you. That's eight weeks where, if we don't have a next project, then I can't keep my employee and contractors working. Right now our only source of revenue for the company is Kickstarter. That's a precarious position, to be sure, but one that works assuming I'm clear on our schedule and you folks are okay with the schedule and willing to back us. Once the Quantum RPG is out, we'll have multiple revenue streams and things will ease off on our stress front, but until then we have to rely on you. There are other issues on our end as well that I'm hesitant to discuss, but I can sum them up by saying over the last year I learned a lot of lessons about scheduling and sharing the load when preparing a game. I thought I could basically do this whole thing with one writer, one artist, one graphic designer, one editor, and one developer. It turns out that hasn't worked. Akyrema City will have multiple writers, multiple artists (including one I'm going to announce tomorrow for the cover that should blow your socks off), one graphic designer, one editor, and one developer. So there it is. All on the table for my original 580 backers. Your feedback has been clear, well-stated, and I share many of your concerns. I hope you can understand our position a little better. You're still the best damn 580 people I know and I can not and will not let you down. The Quantum RPG gets better with each Beta feedback message and re-write and soon I'll start publicly sharing the rules changes so, hopefully, you'll be just as excited about the changes as I am. Hat in hand. There it is. Thanks for your continued support and feedback. I appreciate it in ways I can't express. -Josh At Gen Con last month, I held a 90-minute panel that functioned as a Q&amp;A for the Quantum RPG. I recorded that panel.

The sketches are not final and reflect only the intention of the piece and not necessarily the final image. All of the art in these previews is from super amazing Hugo Solis with the exception of the new Beast and Foe icons which were designed by the equally super amazing Drew Pocza (who I worked with at Paizo Publishing). All of the previews are available as desktop background downloads in four different sizes: just mouse over the images to see which sizes are available and slap your favorite image and size onto your computer for the world to see. Next, as part of our planning for the Summer of Quantum, once the Quantum RPG open beta playtest is underway, Colleen and I plan to run a very short 30-day Kickstarter that will include stickers, buttons, t-shirts, and even Hugo Solis-signed prints of your favorite Quantum RPG Paradigm iconic characters. This Kickstarter serves two purposes: to get those items in print and to give us a small test run on shipping and delivery of the final Quantum RPG hardcover. If we can accomplish shipping for the small Kickstarter rapidly and accurately, we'll know we can do it for the larger one later this year. I hope you'll get involved. Stay tuned after the beta launch for additional details. Finally, it is with no small amount of sadness that I report Infinite X Studio won't have a booth or events at Gen Con this year. There wasn't enough time in the universe for me to make it happen. HOWEVER, I will be there for most of the convention and I'd love to schedule a time to be available for a Q&amp;A, to get drinks, to game, or just hangout. More on that later in the month. I want to thank everyone for their epic patience as we work toward the completion of this project. With a new employee, one of her tasks will be to frequently hit me with the update stick so I keep everyone better informed. As a designer, it's really easy for me to get hyper-focussed and narrow my world-view down to just the game. Colleen will help me keep the focus a bit wider so you know just what the hell we're working on. ;-) Take care, Joshua J. Frost President Infinite X Studio, LLC I've spent the better part of the last several weeks considering many things, my proposed publishing schedule being key among them. This weekend I finally came to a hard conclusion: it's time to scrap the idea of schedules, get the Beta done, and just let everyone play for a while. There are several console and computer game companies I admire specifically for the reason that they never release anything half-ass. If the game isn't ready, they don't release it. Video game companies share some common schedule concerns with pen-and-paper RPG publishing companies, chief among them being the constraints of announcing products up to a year in advance and then, regardless of where the product is or how good it is, cramming it into the announced release date for no reasons other than keeping promises and forcing a cash flow schedule produced independently of the opinions of the designers. In other words, since I'm both the finance manager and the designer for my company, I can talk to myself and say, "Self, you really need to stop focussing so much on your money schedule and instead get back to the heart of the game itself, get the damn thing in Beta, and just let people play it for a while. Sales will come eventually, but they won't last for long if the game is a complete pile of garbage." Self is right! So here's the new plan: 1. Quantum RPG Beta: release it ASAP, get people playing for free. 2. Announce second product via Kickstarter that will likely be, thanks to your massive feedback over the last month, a combination location guide slash mega adventure. 3. End the Quantum RPG Beta when the feedback and playtesting seem complete. 4. Release the final hardcover of the Quantum RPG. 5. Release the location guide slash mega adventure. 6. Think of things to do next based on your massive feedback. No dates, no forced scheduling, no headaches, heartaches, or bellyaches. Game, game, game, game, and game. So this summer, it is my sincere hope, will be the Summer of Quantum. You will spend it playing the Quantum RPG Beta with friends, families, strangers, and denizens of other dimensions. You'll supply me, via the Quantum RPG Beta messageboards, with massive feedback to improve the game, and, perhaps at the end of the Summer, with a great deal of completed playtesting and hundreds of play sessions reported, a release date for the hardcover will become official. Here's where things stand right now: I have about half of the Beta printed out from layout and sitting on the desk next to my keyboard. The other half is in various stages of final design and development and isn't far from completion. Here's where things are headed: On July 1st, I'm hiring Infinite X Studio's first employee to assist me in all things Quantum RPG. Part of my conversation between the finance manager (me) and the lead designer (me) lead to the conclusion that as much fun as it is pretending I can do this all by myself, it's more realistic to assume I can do this with at least one other person dedicated full time to making it happen. This position has already been filled, the employee in question is ready to go, and I'll make a bigger stink about it in about 5 or 6 weeks. Gen Con. As of right now, I have a booth reserved for the show (I finally made it off the waiting list a week or so ago). Knowing, as I've stated above, that the game will be screaming through Beta at Gen Con time and knowing that I will likely have absolutely nothing to show and or sell beyond showing the Beta at the show, it's my feeling that I should scrap the booth idea and attend Gen Con with the sole purpose of running the Beta for folks day after day after day after day until my voice falls out of my mouth and continues to run it for me while I wander the show floor in mute exhaustion. To those of you attending Gen Con, I have a serious question: what should I do? Here are the options as I see them: 1. Attend Gen Con with a booth. Wave at people and talk about the game while volunteers run the Beta in a room somewhere. 2. Attend Gen Con with a booth. Have volunteers wave at people and talk about the game while I run the Beta with other volunteers in a room somewhere. 3. Attend Gen Con with a booth where we sell Quantum RPG t-shirts, stickers, buttons, and MAYBE a printed version of the Quantum RPG Beta while me and/or volunteers man the booth while me and/or volunteers run the Beta with other volunteers in a room somewhere. 4. Scrap the booth. Save loads of money. Set myself up in a room somewhere and run the Beta. Options 1 &amp; 2 cost money with no income, but the game gets played at the show. Option 3 requires a bit of extra work on our end (but I'll have an employee to handle it), we (in theory) make some money back to cover the cost of the show, and the game gets played at the show. This option runs the risk of not selling a thing. Option 4 forgoes the risk of not selling a thing and instead has me and perhaps a few volunteers making sure the game gets played. *I* have a sense of which option I should choose, but I'm curious Gen Con attendees: which would you prefer to see happen? Quantum RPG Preview Now that I've bored you all to death, here's some fun stuff. A complete preview of the Archer Paradigm as it will appear in the Beta. Enjoy. :-) ARCHER [Melee Paradigm] Archers prefer to see the world from a distance. They are at home perched in the lower branches of a giant tree, or standing atop a low rise as armored, sword wielding foes approach from below. A true archer feels as though the bow is not just a weapon, it is a trusted ally, a longtime friend, something so much a part of everything the archer stands for, that the bow might as well simply be another limb. Archers are keen of step, nimble, and hyper aware of their surroundings. They long to accomplish great feats with their bow—like striking a mounted warrior from his saddle with one arrow from a great distance, or putting three arrows in flight at the same time only to see all strike true in the center of the Archer’s target. Archers are not close combat experts, but neither are they inferior in melee range. Some of their Style Trees are designed specifically to protect them should they find themselves within range of sword or spear. Other Style Trees improve their ability to pick and hit their targets, as well as increased speed, mounted ability, and Omnimancy-powered Spark abilities. Archers are the perfect support combat Heroes. Their mobility, ranged combat ability, and their penchant for stealth and acrobatics keeps them often out of harm’s way where they can rain arrows on their enemies. Root Scale : Fatigue Wound Steps : 5/4/3/2/1/1; Fatigue Steps : 5/4/3/2/1/1 Trained Expertise : Acrobatics, Bows, Climbing, Running, Stealth, Survival, Swimming, Thrown Weapons, and Tracking Core Ability : An Archer has no minimum range when performing a Combat Test with a bow and can thus target adjacent defenders. Additionally, Archer’s gain a five-step bonus on any Combat Tests involving a bow. Style Trees : Arresting Arrow, Fleet-Footed, Mounted Archer, Sniper, Spark Archer, and Trick Shot Arresting Arrow Arresting Arrow is a new Combat Tactic exclusive to the Archer. This Combat Tactic is performed by firing a single arrow from a bow at a single defender within range. Each additional Aptitude increases the power and potential abilities of the Arresting Arrow. I . If the Archer wins the Combat Test and would otherwise have dealt wound damage dots, the defender is instead pushed 1m away from the Archer and takes a five-step penalty to his Dodge Defense for one round. The defender takes no wound damage dots from the arrow, regardless of wound damage dots dealt. FD : 3. Regained : O. II . ( Requires Agility 5 ) As Arresting Arrow I , but the defender must win an Endurance Defense Test or reduce his Movement to 0 for one round. FD : 5. Regained : O. III . ( Requires Agility 7 ) As Arresting Arrow II , but the defender also gains the Knocked Down/Prone condition if he loses the Endurance Defense Test. FD : 7. Regained : O. IV . ( Requires Agility 10 ) As Arresting Arrow III , but the Archer’s Arresting Arrow Combat Tactic ignores AR during Combat Tests. FD : 9. Regained : O. Fleet-Footed Fleet-Footed improves the Archer’s mobility, affording the Archer extra defense, extra Movement, and an Omnimancy-infused ability to be in several places at once. I . When performed, this Aptitude increases the Archer’s Movement and Dodge Defense by 50% (round down). FD : 5. Regained : R. II . ( Requires Agility 7 ) As Fleet-Footed I , but anyone targeting the Archer in combat must perform two Combat Tests instead of one and must take the result of the lower test. FD : 7. Regained : R. III . ( Requires Agility 10 ) As Fleet-Footed II , but the Archer’s Movement and Dodge Defense are both doubled. This replaces the ability of Fleet-Footed I. FD : 10. Regained : R. IV . ( Requires Agility 14 ) When performed, this Aptitude increases the velocity of every atom in the Archer’s body and he vibrates outward, occupying three different 1m squares at the exact same time all within 10m of his original point. All three of the Archer duplicates may take a single Core Action. All of the duplicates act as the Archer—so if the duplicates each fire one arrow, the original Archer “fired” three arrows; if each duplicate uses an Aptitude that deals Fatigue damage dots to itself, then the original Archer takes all of the Fatigue damage dots dealt; and any of the duplicates move and become targets of Triggered Actions that deal wound damage dots to them, the original Archer takes the wound damage dots applied to the duplicates. This effect ends at the end of the Archer’s turn. FD : 10. Regained : O. Mounted Archer Mounted Archer improves the Archer’s mounted archery abilities, removing penalties, increasing Dodge Defense, and increasing wound damage with bows. I . The Archer no longer takes any penalties to Combat Tests while mounted (see the Animal Handling Expertise on page XX). II . ( Requires Animal Handling 3 ) As Mounted Archer I , but the Archer also gains a five-step bonus to his Dodge Defense while mounted. III . ( Requires Animal Handling 5 ) As Mounted Archer II , but any bow the Archer fires while mounted gains +2 DR. IV . ( Requires Animal Handling 7 ) As Mounted Archer III , but when the Archer wins a Combat Test with a bow while mounted, the Defender must win an Endurance Defense Test or gain the Knocked Down/Prone condition. Sniper Sniper increases the Archer’s maximum range with a bow as well as adding one new exclusive Combat Tactic and one exclusive change to the Focus Combat Tactic. I . The first range segment for any bow used by an Archer is doubled. (e.g., a range of 5–40 would instead be 5–80; the Archer’s Core Ability still applies.) II . ( Requires Agility 5 ) The Archer may now use the Vulnerable Shot Combat Tactic. The Vulnerable Shot Combat Tactic requires the Archer to select a single defender, fire one arrow at him, and perform a Combat Test to determine success. If the Archer wins the test, he calculates wound damage dots normally but then reduces the final damage dot result (after AR) by 50% (round down). After reducing the damage, the Archer may then select one of the following Conditions to apply to the defender: Blinded, Deafened, Hindered, or Hobbled (see Chapter 4). The chosen Condition lasts for one round unless the Archer Aces the dice test, in which case the Condition lasts for a number of rounds equal to the Ace Penalty of the dice test (page XX). FD : 3. Regained : O. III . The first range segment for any bow used by an Archer is tripled. (e.g., a range of 5–40 would instead be 5–120; the Archer’s Core Ability still applies.) IV . ( Requires Cognition 7 ) When performing the Focus Basic Combat Tactic (page XX), the Sniper no longer takes a penalty to the Combat Test and deals an additional 50% damage (round down) on the final wound damage dot total. The Focus Basic Combat Tactic, however, gains a Fatigue Damage rating. FD : 7. Regained : O. Spark Archer Spark Archer gives the Archer the ability to infuse his bow with upgrades similar to those that can be purchased for more advanced weapons (see Chapter 3). No more than one Spark Archer Aptitude can be active on a single bow at a time. I . As a Free Action, the Archer’s arrows deal acid, flame, ice, or shock damage (choose one) instead of ballistic damage. This effect lasts until the Archer chooses to end it. FD: 1/round. Regained: R. II . ( Requires Cognition 5 ) As Spark Archer I , but the Archer’s arrows also apply related conditions upon dealing wound damage dots to the defender. Acid damage applies the Corroded condition, flame damage applies the Ignited condition, ice damage applies the Frozen condition, and shock damage applies the Electrocuted condition (see Chapter 4). This effect lasts until the Archer chooses to end it. FD : 2/round. Regained : R. III . ( Requires Cognition 7 ) As a Free Action, the Archer’s arrows can do one of two things: deal shrapnel damage and, if wound damage dots are successfully dealt to the defender, apply the Bleeding condition or deal force damage and, if wound damage dots are successfully dealt, the Progenitor performs a free Knock Down Combat Tactic with Cognition + Prime versus the defender. This effect lasts until the Archer chooses to end it. FD : 5/round. Regained : R. IV . ( Requires Cognition 10 ) As a Free Action, a single arrow fired from an Archer’s bow targets a 2m AoE instead of a single target, potentially dealing wound damage dots to all defenders inside the AoE. FD : 7. Regained : O. Trick Shot Trick Shot both increases an Archer’s rate of fire with a bow and allows the Archer to attempt nearly impossible shots with ease. I . ( Requires Agility 3/Cognition 2 ) The Archer fires two arrows simultaneously at the same defender. Both arrows hit or miss together and require only one Combat Test. FD : 3. Regained : O. II . ( Requires Agility 5/Cognition 2 ) The Archer fires a single arrow at a single defender somewhere behind cover with no penalties. The Archer must know within a 2m AoE where the defender is in order for the arrow to have a chance to hit, otherwise it automatically misses. FD : 5. Regained : O. III . ( Requires Agility 7/Cognition 3 ) As Trick Shot I , but the Archer fires three arrows simultaneously at the same defender. FD : 7. Regained : O. IV . ( Requires Agility 9/Cognition 5 ) As Trick Shot II , but the Archer fires two arrows at a single defender somewhere behind cover with no penalties. FD : 7. Regained : O. Joshua J. Frost President/Owner Infinite X Studio, LLC Late night serious musings: I've had it stuck in my head from the beginning that the first product we produce after the Quantum RPG hardcover should be a mega adventure to support the game. That feels right to me--but I'm not making this game for me, I'm making it for you. What do *you* want as the first support product? I vow never to fall into a splat book mentality and I'm not a huge fan of shotgunning rules into the sky in order to make money. So keeping those things in mind, what--based only on the limited information you may have right now about the game--would you like to see after the Quantum RPG hardcover? Tell me loud and clear: I want to listen. Joshua J. Frost President/Owner Infinite X Studio, LLC I was just handed a fat stack of printed out Beta pages for editing. Here's a quick update on where the Beta stands: 50% laid out and in editing 25% in development 25% fast-approaching development Take care, Joshua J. Frost President/Owner Infinite X Studio, LLC I know, probably not the update you were hoping for today. Despite 5-1/2 years in RPG publishing, doing everything that leads up to layout on my own is teaching me a lot about, well, everything that leads up to layout and so while I know the process, I'm still perfecting it. That said, here's where we stand today, April 4: The Beta has 6 chapters for a total of 118 pages. All of the art needed for the Beta is in. Three of the six chapters are, since this last weekend, in layout. The remaining three will be in layout before the end of this next weekend. My layout guru is awesome and works a full time job that's not IXS (for now) so we are at the mercy of my abilities and her full time work schedule. To be clear: she is awesome. Delays are entirely my fault. :-) The Dev Team are reading the final few chapters coming into them on the Dev forums furiously and providing amazing feedback. They will receive one more chapter in the coming days that I'll turn around rather quickly to get into the final layout. Obviously the beta won't be out today. My hope is to have it out no later than 4/16 for the backers (a week later for the general public). The day the beta releases, the schedule I announced in an earlier update will be adjusted and I'll release a new schedule with similar timelines. This shouldn't have any effect on the final book's schedule as possible beta delays were built in as a fail safe. So hang in there, loyal backers. Quantum is coming. Take care, Joshua J. Frost President, Infinite X Studio What in the world might this be? Let the speculation begin! Art, as always, by the amazing Hugo Solis. Joshua J.

It doesn't come anywhere close to the number of options that will be available in the rules, though! Enjoy! Joshua J. Frost President/Owner Infinite X Studio, LLC Art, as always, by the incredibly talented Hugo Solis. This is a preview of the azi, an androgynous race of snake people. Only azi can tell the difference between their genders. Enjoy! Joshua J. Frost President/Owner Infinite X Studio, LLC Enjoy! Joshua J. Frost President/Owner Infinite X Studio, LLC I have two favorite quotes regarding the mysterious thing called a "deadline." In the vein of the humorous: "I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by." -Douglas Adams And in the vein of the inspirational: "A deadline is negative inspiration. Still, it's better than no inspiration at all." -Rita Mae Brown A great deal of planning and work have gone into the schedule for Infinite X Studio. Planning extends beyond the Quantum Roleplaying Game rulebook this Kickstarter launched. And it's high time I told you all about it. Kickstarter figures heavily into the first year or so of the company--without Kickstarter, none of these projects are possible (including this one--now made possible!). Without further adieu, the plan for the near future of Infinite X Studio! April 4 : Quantum Roleplaying Game beta playtest released to the Kickstarter backers who pledged $10 or more to the project. April 11 : Quantum Roleplaying Game beta playtest released to the general public. April 23 : 30-day Kickstarter begins for Singularity, a Quantum RPG Mega Adventure ; a 256-page adventure to be released in November 2012. May 9 : Quantum Roleplaying Game beta playtest officially ends (though game play and feedback should absolutely feel free to continue!). July 18 : 30-day Kickstarter begins for Quantum Roleplaying Game: Book of Beasts, Vol 1 to be released in February 2013. July 25 : Final Quantum Roleplaying Game PDF released to the Kickstarter backers who pledged $15 or more to the project. August 1 : Quantum Roleplaying Game Kickstarter book orders ship for backers who pledged $35 or more to the project. August 15 : Official Release Date of the Quantum Roleplaying Game worldwide--in retail hobby stores, online at infiniteXstudio.com , and at Gen Con 2012. August 15 : Free PDF Quantum RPG "Starter Adventure" released on infiniteXstudio.com . September : Quantum RPG Starter Kit released (details forthcoming). October 31 : Final Singularity PDF released to the backers who pledged $15 or more to the project. November 7 : Kickstarter book orders for Singularity ship. November 21 : Official release date for Singularity worldwide--in retail hobby stores and online at infiniteXstudio.com . January 30, 2013 : Book of Beasts, Vol 1 PDF released to the backers who pledged $15 or more to the project. February 20, 2013 : Official Release Date for Quantum Roleplaying Game: Book of Beasts, Vol 1 worldwide--in retail hobby stores and online at infiniteXstudio.com . Coming later in 2013: Akyrema City, Quantum's Core Quantum Entire: the Complete World Atlas …and more! Quantum Entire will be the last project funded via Kickstarter--all thanks to everyone who help crowd source Infinite X Studio's first year's worth of projects! We'll speak again in a little less than a month. :-) Take care, Joshua J. Frost Seriously, I don't think people use the exclamation, "Egads!" enough anymore. Like Don Draper-style hats, I think "Egads!" should come back into style. Enough of that, though: sorry for such a delay between updates! I'm working on the largest, most complicated, and simply awesomest chapter of the Quantum RPG and when I don't feel buried up to my nose in design I'm sleeping and dreaming about being buried up to my nose in design. The game is progressing quite well and so is the company. I'm nearing the end of a Small Business Administration series of classes called "Launch &amp; Grow" that's pumping me so full of new business info that the end result should either be an even more successful company than I planned or a complete Joshua Frost explosion that covers my office Mr. Creosote-style. After my SBA councilor and I discovered today through the magic and mystical arts known as "accounting" that Kickstarter.com is the best thing since the invention of fire, I wanted not only to drop another update on everyone, but thank you, once again, from the depths of my incredibly deep heart for backing this project. We're still shooting for a Spring release (likely late Spring) and I'm still shooting for an open public beta playtest of the rules soon-ish. On that front, I'm hoping beyond hopes to have the beta ready in March. Please hold my feet to the aforementioned invention of fire should I enjoy the whizzing sound that the deadline makes as it blows by. Truly Giddy, Joshua J. Frost President Infinite X Studio, LLC Okay, not more--I lied. It's just the other three. Development It's coming along nicely, my little book is! The Dev Forum is active and we're plowing through chapters and I have to say I've been very impressed with the Kickstarter Development level backers and their helpful insights and hard work. My intention is still to get a playtest document released by the end of the month. Mutations I put a call out on the Forums yesterday looking for suggested beneficial and detrimental mutations. If you didn't see that call and want to add some ideas, go here: <url>#$! off getting art ready for the playtest and the final book. He's really outdoing himself. Here's a sneak peek at four more iconic Paradigms. Enjoy! Hello Quantum Roleplaying Game Community! Just 16 hours left to pledge!

That's how seriously cool access to this board is. :-) If you pledged at the levels noted above but aren't interested in participating on the boards, that's okay. If you're chomping at the bit to get involved, make sure you sign up for your account as soon as possible! Once the project funds, I get access to a survey system and I will use that system to make sure everyone has the appropriate access to the appropriate boards on the Infinite X Studio Forums. (The survey system is also where I will eventually collect shipping addresses as well.) Thank you all so much. Take care, Joshua J. Frost President, Infinite X Studio, LLC Good afternoon, Quantum RPG Community! My last update had a few timeline errors in it because I was high on holiday cookies and apparently thought copy-and-paste could read my mind. I was very sad to discover that mind-reading technology is still beyond the grasp of Apple. sadface I'm going to hit you with the standard reminders as well as some new reminders for those of you about to gain access to the Design Board and the Development Board .

I appreciate everything all of you have done for the project in general and for me personally. Thank you all so much. Take care, Joshua J. Frost President, Infinite X Studio, LLC We're headed toward the finish line and less than three days remain on the pledge phase of this project! Here are some very important reminders about what every backer needs to do before the project funds: *Amazon will process your pledge as a payment around 9:29 AM Pacific Time on December 29th. Please take a moment to check your Amazon payments account and ensure that everything is still current and up-to-date. If your Amazon payments account has issues when Amazon processes the pledges, you'll not be charged and you'll also lose your place on the pledge list.

There are some wonderful pledge rewards still available in the higher dollar rewards. If you need to cancel or reduce your pledge, you also have just three days to do so (and we totally understand if you need to). Thank you all so much. Take care, Joshua J. Frost President, Infinite X Studio, LLC I saw on HBO, they were advertising this boxing match. They said, "It's a fight to the finish!" That's a good place to end. -- Mitch Hedberg We're just nine days away from the finale and I want everyone at every pledge level, everyone who couldn't pledge but spread the word, and anyone else who just stopped by and read a post or two to know that I deeply and sincerely appreciate your help and support. My little idea has in just under two months turned into a full-blown company and I know beyond any shadow of doubt that I would not be able to do this without all of you. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Now that we've passed both our first target ($25K) and our second target ($36K) many people are asking, "What's the next reward target?" My answer: There isn't one. :-( I'll be honest and say that I only hoped we'd top $25K and I never imagined we'd top $30K, never mind $36K! Adding another reward now would force me to take my eye off the ball (design, development, etc) to do the proper due diligence and planning a new reward would deserve and I simply can't right now. So we're all going to have to sit back, watch the number tick up for the next nine days, and sigh happily in the knowledge that not only has this been a success of epic proportions, but this has also been an epic success of the Quantum RPG community! Again: thank you all so much! Below are two additional previews: the Human Corsair iconic and the Mutant Crusader iconic. Previews will continue right up until the game's release, so even after this project funds, this Kickstarter page for Quantum RPG will remain active on a weekly basis. Right now our schedule says we'll be punting a free PDF beta playtest version of the game out to the public in January 2012 (next month) with a May 2012 release date of the final product. I know the estimates on the Kickstarter page have said April 2012 since the beginning, but a recent re-appraisal of the full production schedule pushed that to May in order to be (a) more realistic and (b) reduce the chance of missing the release date to nearly zero. Important Notice for Backers! I will put up a bunch of additional reminders about this very topic before the next nine days are up, but here's what every single backer needs to do before this project funds: *Amazon will process your pledge as a payment around 9:29 AM Pacific Time on December 29th (one week from this Thursday). Please take a moment to check your Amazon payments account and ensure that everything is still current and up-to-date. If your Amazon payments account has issues when Amazon processes the pledges, you'll not be charged and you'll also lose your place on the pledge list. Additionally, make sure whatever account you have associated with your Amazon payments account has the correct balance in there on the 29th--your pledge can be canceled if Amazon determines insufficient funds. *If you want to upgrade to a higher pledge level to get additional rewards, you still have nine days to do so! There are some wonderful pledge rewards still available in the higher dollar rewards. If you need to cancel or reduce your pledge, you also have just nine days to do so (and we totally understand if you need to). Thank you all so much. Take care, Joshua J. Frost President, Infinite X Studio, LLC As many of you know, I'm buried up to my eyeballs in this project now and that's essentially eliminated video blogs from me for the time being. We're about ready to announce the full schedule including the public playtest. Stay tuned. :-) With that in mind, I received a near final cover sketch in from artist Hugo Solis and we decided to share that with you. So here it is: a preview of the full-color cover on the Quantum Roleplaying Game hardcover book. (The logo is just there for branding--that's not the final spot or necessarily even the final logo.) Observe and let your imaginations run wild. Take care, Joshua J. Frost, President, Infinite X Studio, LLC Before I jump into today's update, just a quick reminder that we're counting down the days now until the Quantum RPG project funds. If we can reach $36,000 by then, Infinite X Studio will be able to produce 24" x 36" color world poster maps included with every pledge $35 and above. We're very close! Given the number of days left, we only need 5 new $35 or higher pledges each day for the rest of the month to reach that goal. Keep telling your friends and spreading the word! $35 plus shipping to get 2 copies of the limited edition hardcover plus a 24" x 36" color world poster map sounds like a great deal to me. :-) ------ Complete List of Paradigms No video today, unfortunately, I'm working hard to hit our first deadline here in the Infinite X Studio office so I'll do today's reveal via the archaic written word. (Oooooooh, marvel at it's ancient nobility!) I asked on the Infinite X Studio forums (are you signed up over there yet?) if there was one thing I could reveal to everyone early, and most everyone said either the complete list of Paradigms or the third power source (Prime and Void being the other two). So I decided, in the spirit of the holidays, to go ahead and reveal both *and* write a small one-sentence description of each Paradigm as well. Below each Paradigm I've also listed what their second Damage Scale is. Every Paradigm uses the Wound Damage Scale to track physical injury and every Paradigm has a second Damage Scale to track either Fatigue (for melee or ranged weapon Paradigms) or Prime (Omnimancers who can draw deep from the power sources of Quantum). A refresher: Paradigms are the way Heroes see the world. You might think of them as character classes or archetypes in the language of other RPGs, but we see them as something wider in scope. A Paradigm is how a Hero interacts with Quantum, how a Hero touches the power of Quantum, and in some instances, how a Hero pledges to act throughout her life. Here are all of the Paradigms in alphabetical order: Archer (Fatigue) The master of ranged combat with a bow or crossbow. Corsair (Fatigue) A daredevil of the high seas or the high clouds. Crusader (Fatigue) The defender in the dark, the bringer of light, he who stands alone against the Void. Generalist (Fatigue or Prime; chosen at Hero creation) Renaissance man; Jack-of-All-Trades; dabbler in some, master of none. Hunter (Fatigue) The lone wolf of the woods, relentlessly tracking her prey either for pleasure or profit. Immortal (Fatigue) The Grecco-Roman strong man, fearless, athletic, and blessed with an ability to live forever--an ability that comes at a high cost. Myrmidon (Fatigue) A veteran soldier, a campaigner, a determined warrior who accomplishes the mission no matter the physical toll. Necromancer (Prime [Void]) An Omnimancer whose knowledge of Prime extends beyond life itself--even living organisms are matter and any matter can be shaped into a tool with the right ingenuity. Progenitor (Prime) Only Progenitors have a deep understanding of the technology of the Time Before. Only they can accurately control it, fix it, revitalize it, or touch it deep to make both great and terrible things happen. Reaver (Fatigue) The savage fighter, the destroyer, the menace, the bruiser--the Reaver lives not to win, he lives to fight. Sage (Prime [Suria]) Sages are urbanized practitioners of the Apothecary Arts. They are churgeons, philosophers, scientists, and thinkers. Shaman (Prime [Suria]) Shaman are the rural practitioners of the Apothecary Arts. They stand as leaders, prophets, and champions of the natural world against the encroaching technology of the Time Before. Slayer (Fatigue) Slayers are highly specialized fighters, trained to kill specific types of beasts. The Crusader stands against the Void--the Slayer stands against everything else that hides in the wild places of the world. Troubadour (Fatigue) Secret spies and messengers, court performers, sleepers, poisoners, the jovial fellow you least expect to put a knife in your back. Valkyrie (Fatigue) Mostly female, all trained from the ranks of street children, Valkyries roam the battlefield deciding who lives and who dies. Warlock (Prime [Void]) Often mad with power, the Warlock touches Void so deep they risk losing themselves but in return gain such violent power that they are rightfully feared throughout Quantum. Warrior (Fatigue) The man-art-arms, dragoon, guardian, weapon master, or knight. The armored soldier at the front, standing ready to protect those behind him. The Third Power Source The third power source comes from the star at the heart of Quantum. Called Suria, the third power source is the embodiment of heat, light, and the healing powers of the Apothecary Arts. Whereas Prime is the machine at the heart of Suria that powers Quantum and Void is the power from the vast emptiness outside Quantum leaking in, Suria is everything else--the land, the sea, the clouds, the trees, the animals, everything that connects the world into a living, breathing cycle of life. Suria hasn't always been a part of Quantum, just as Void hasn't. Many who touch Suria say that Suria arose to fight the Void, to keep its darkness contained. Though the peoples of Quantum apply anthropomorphic terms to all of the power sources, none of them are good nor evil. How they are used, how they are touched, and assumptions the citizens make about them day after day is what defines them all. Take care, Joshua Frost President, Infinite X Studio, LLC Enjoy! As requested over on the Infinite X Studio forums , this week's video blog is about how well-connected the "modern" nations are in the Quantum world. Pay attention for a lovely art sneak peek there at the end of the video too--art by Hugo Solis. Also, check out this thread over on the Infinite X Studio forums as I'm letting you decide one secret that I will reveal about the Quantum world--and I'll reveal it next Monday in the next video blog! You have to register to post, so register and let me know what secret you want me to reveal next. There have already been some excellent suggestions. I'll make the decision on Friday based on the community's posts/votes. Enjoy! For those of you celebrating Thanksgiving, have a happy and bountiful series of meals, football games, meals, deserts, meals, football games, and most importantly: meals. I'm thankful for all of you! Take care, Joshua J. Frost, President, Infinite X Studio, LLC As requested over on the Infinite X Studio forums , this week's video blog is about the technology level of the "modern day" Quantum world. Below you can also find art previews of several weapons from the game: battle axe, Corsair's Blade, disposable spark pistol, and multi-charge spark rifle. Art by Hugo Solis. Enjoy! Hey folks! This being my first Kickstarter, I had a vague understanding of how shipping would work once I launched the project. Now that we've been going strong now for 20 days, I have a much better understanding! So what I've done is locked the $35 , $80 , and $150 pledges to the numbers they're at right now. Those pledges included text about manually adding shipping--text that was being missed or was causing confusion. Instead, I've added the following: For the former $35 pledge, there is now a $42 pledge for U.S. addresses that includes shipping and a $47 pledge for International addresses that includes shipping. For the former $80 pledge, there is now an $87 pledge for U.S. addresses that includes shipping and a $92 pledge for International addresses that includes shipping. For the former $150 pledge, there is now a $157 pledge for U.S. addresses that includes shipping and a $162 pledge for International addresses that includes shipping. Because we reached the $25,000 goal, all of these pledge levels are still doubled for limited edition signed and numbered hardcovers of the Quantum RPG book. My hope is that this limits future confusion. I really hope I'm right. :-) If you previously pledged at the original $35 , $80 , or $150 levels and have not added shipping, please add $7 for US shipping and $12 for International shipping. Incorrect shipping may delay the receipt of your book(s). And I don't want that to happen to anyone! My apologies if this causes anyone consternation or confusion. For our next Kickstarter, we will be absolutely sure to get it correct right from start. Thank you again everyone for your massive support! Every day I spend finishing the game I'm driven by the knowledge of your confidence and excitement. I sincerely appreciate everything you've done for us here at Infinite X Studio and for the Quantum RPG project! Take care, Joshua Frost, President, Infinite X Studio, LLC First off, thanks again so much for helping push the pledges to $25k and beyond. This game is only possible because of your support and I know it and sincerely appreciate it. At $36,000 total pledges, I will ship (1) one 24" x 36" full color folded poster world map of Quantum with every single pledge $35 and above. While there will be a map of the world inside the Quantum RPG hardcover, it will be a black &amp; white map and obviously won't be bigger than a single page. This 24" x 36" poster world map will not only give you the world in amazing full color, but it will be large enough to include a wide variety of extra map tags to add both a little mystery to the world and ensuring that all locations generated during design show up on the poster map. Keep doing what you're doing and spread the word! Remember that anyone who pledges $35 or more to the project right now gets double the limited edition signed and numbered hardcover rewards. Please don't forget to include shipping above and beyond your pledge if your pledge level calls for it. Thanks again so much! Let's hit $36k so you folks can once again force me to think of something even more cool to set as a future goal. Thanks! Joshua J. Frost, President, Infinite X Studio, LLC As requested over on the Infinite X Studio forums , this week's video blog is about Prime, the source of all power and energy on the robotic world of Quantum. Enjoy! Congratulations everyone! You spread the word, pledged your hard-earned dollars, and we cracked the $25k barrier, our latest goal. What does this mean for you? Well, if you pledged $35 or more to the project, then you get double the limited edition, signed and numbered copies of the Quantum RPG hardcover. At the $35 pledge level, this means you will receive (2) two copies instead of (1) one with NO ADDITIONAL SHIPPING CHARGES! Yes! Please note that this does not double any regular edition copies pledged for by retailers--sorry folks, you already get an awesome discount. ;-) Give your extra copy to a friend, keep it as an extra table copy for your game, shrink-wrap it for it's obvious massive future value, or sleep with it under your pillow at night so you can learn more about the game while you sleep*! :-) A Few Notes: Please don't forget that if your pledge level requires shipping, you need to add the shipping to your pledge--it won't be charged on our end. So for the $35 pledge, US shipping needs to add $7 to the pledge for a total of $42 and International (non-US) shipping needs to add $12 to the pledge for a total of $47. For the $80 pledge, please add $7 for US and $12 for International, and so on. If the shipping isn't added to your pledge when the game funds on December 30, it may delay your receipt of the game when the book is finished. Also, a quick note on pledging: please be aware that Amazon.com does not take the money out immediately upon your pledge. Instead they hit your card for a $1 charge to prove it's a real card. The money doesn't get withdrawn until December 30 at 9:58 A.M. Pacific Time (which means you can pledge anytime between now and then). So please make sure you keep the money in your account and don't assume that Amazon.com has already taken it out because they haven't. You can lose your pledge if Amazon.com can't withdraw the money. Also, I'd hate for anyone to overdraw because of our game. :-) I'll put out a few more reminders about this in December. I'll be adding a new $35,000 goal here in the next few days or so. I'm waiting for a quote to come back from the printer before I make a decision on what that goal will be--I want it to be something amazing and useful. Again, thanks so much! We're funded, we're past $25k, but we're not done yet! The more we raise, the more books we can sell, and the more popular this game will be right from the start. Keep spreading the word for me and I promise I'll keep making the best game I can possibly make for you. From the bottom of my heart, in the humblest way I know how, thank you all so very much. The Quantum RPG would not be possible without you. Take care, Joshua J. Frost, President, Infinite X Studio, LLC * Sleeping with the game under your pillow has not been proven in clinical trials to actually increase your knowledge of the game. Hola! First, I want to thank you all for the incredible support that you've given Josh's Quantum Roleplaying Game project. Just a few weeks ago I was worried I wouldn't be able to produce enough artwork to help bring folks like you into the project--silly me! I should have known that Josh's mojo, street cred', and plain awesomeness were more than enough to move the ball down field and kick that goal! None of this--Josh's game, Josh's company, and my artwork--could happen without the support of all of you. I continue to be amazed that not only have we received impressive monetary support, but that this new community's word of mouth has done an amazing job spreading the word about this project to other forums, groups, and so on. I want to personally thank Josh for inviting me to shape the Quantum Roleplaying Game visually. My biggest wish is to thank him properly by turning this chance into something like what DiTerlizzi did for Planescape, what Brom and Baxa did for Darksun, or what Wayne Reynolds does for Pathfinder. Maybe in in the not-so-distant future some might think of me as part of that elite crew and I'll know it was the Quantum RPG that gave me the opportunity to achieve that. I also want to share as much of my artistic opportunity with you as I can. Art orders tend to come filled with spoilers and information not ready for the public, but rest-assured that anything Josh lets me share (and he assures me that I'll be able to share quite a bit!) will be shared with you as frequently as I can manage. Josh is giving me an incredible opportunity to shape this world, but your feedback on the process will provide incredible opportunities as well. Come join us on the Infinite X Studio forums and take a moment to introduce yourself and then jump right in. Who knows? Perhaps something you suggest will make its way into the artwork--perhaps your idea will be the next iconic Paradigm character. :-) <url>"Butterfrog" Solis Good morning! First thing, before we crack open the hood and start cataloging all the moving parts, is for me to once again say thank you: THANK YOU! As I was building out the plan for the first week and getting ready to launch this project, I strove at every step to keep my expectations at 0 and simply accept whatever level of success the project generated. I had a plan, I had a game, I had awesome people assisting me at every step--there wasn't anything to do beyond launch and sit back and wait for the results. And the results are nothing short of amazing. So thank you again to everyone who's backed the project so far. For those of you may be coming in to this project for the first time because of this video, welcome! I hope you enjoy what you see and that your enjoyment translates to support. :-) The video is 14-1/2 minutes and covers most of the basics of the Infinite Roleplaying Engine, the rules system behind the Quantum Roleplaying Game. It introduces a large number of new terms and jargon. Those of you with a great deal of experience with roleplaying games will likely have no problem keeping up, but those of you who may be new to roleplaying games with this project and anyone else who might feel overwhelmed by the terminology, can refer to the handy Glossary of Terms below. At anytime during the video, if I hit you with a new term you don't quite understand or repeat a term you missed, pause the video, consult the Glossary, and hit play again. Though I strive to keep confusion to a minimum, I'm sure I might leave some of you confused anyway. If that's the case, please don't hesitate to post questions below the video in the comments section. Please also take a moment up there on the left to click the button to like this update on Facebook. Let your friends know they can find many details about the game mechanics behind the Quantum RPG right here in this video. Glossary of Quantum RPG Terms Ace : a greater-than-successful attempt during a Combat Test; aces often impose penalties on the target of the test. Agility : a physical attribute that represents your Hero's physical flexibility and speed. Aptitudes : the "powers" or "special abilities" that each Style Tree possesses. Archer : one of Quantum RPG's 16 specialized Paradigms; Archers focus their world view on the art of firing a bow. Armor Rating : a number that determines by how much you reduce Wound dots taken from a weapon, spell, or other ability. Attempt Dice : a d20 rolled along side the Result Dice during a Combat Test. Attributes : an abstract number score that tracks your Hero's physical and mental statistics. Beast : non-civilized foes in the world of Quantum. Cognition : a mental attribute that represents your Hero's intelligence and reasoning capacity. Combat Test : a dice test made using the Attempt Dice (a d20) and the Result Dice (by Step) to determine the outcome of a combat action. Damage Scales : every Hero or beast on Quantum has a Wound Scale that tracks physical damage. Melee Heroes have a Fatigue Scale that tracks physical endurance and magic Heroes have a Prime Scale that tracks mental endurance. Defense : a statistic that measures a Hero or Beast's ability to resist certain types of attacks; the four Defenses are Dodge, Perception, Health, and Sanity. Expertise : the skills and training with which your Hero excels or is considered an expert. Flub : a less-than-successful attempt during a Combat Test; a flub often imposes a penalty on the Hero or Beast that rolled it. Generalist : Quantum RPG's only non-specialized Paradigm. Guide : the person who runs or tells the story of a single game session or campaign (several game sessions) instead of playing a Hero. Hero : the character you play in the Quantum Roleplaying Game. Influence : a mental attribute that represents your Hero's ability to convince or lead others. Melee Archer : a Style Tree of the Archer paradigm focussed on keeping the Archer safe in close combat. Opposed Test : a Hero's Dice Step test vs. an opponent where both the Hero and the Opponent roll their Step for the opposed Expertise (such as Negotiation) and determine the winner of the test by whomever rolls higher. Paradigm : a unique and highly specialized way your Hero views the world; also called "character class" or "archetype." Penalties : a reduction in Step applied to a test for any number of reasons.. Polyhedral Dice : a set of dice used in many roleplaying games such as the 20-sided-dice (or d20), the 12-sided-dice (or d12), and so on (d10, d8, d6, d4). Power : a physical attribute that represents your Hero's health and strength. Prime : the source of all power and energy on Quantum; it can be felt and touched by all living things. Recover : the Prime Scale and Fatigue Scale Recover one dot per turn of damage, but they cannot recover Reserved dots. Reserve : when casting a spell or using an aptitude that Reserves dots in a Damage Scale, those dots are not Recovered normally unless the spell or Aptitude is dismissed. Result Dice : the Step dice rolled during a Combat Test; Result Dice are typically rolled vs. one of an opponent's Defense scores. Spark Shield : the first Aptitude for the Archer's "Melee Archer" Style Tree. Steps (also Dice Steps ): an abstract way to compare attributes and expertise between paradigms and between paradigms and beasts; also how you determine what dice to roll for Opposed tests, Unopposed tests, and the Result Dice portion of the Combat Test. Also, the term "Steps" can apply to the scaling damage levels in the Damage Scales. Style Tree : each Paradigm has four Style Trees (each with six Aptitudes) and each tree represents a unique way to focus and customize your Hero. Unopposed Test : a Hero's Dice Step test vs. a difficulty number established by the Guide; rolling equal to or less than the difficulty number means the test was successful and rolling below it means the test was a failure. Wound Score : the amount of damage (in wound dots) a weapon, spell, or other ability causes. Wound scores can be reduced by armor rating. Some Other Things You Might Want to Check Out Josh's Facebook page : <url>#!/InfiniteXStudio Sign up on the Infinite X Studio forums : <url>’s Skull games to ask if I’d be interested in joining a project he'd been working on for a while. I had such little understanding then of exactly what he wanted my help with. Now I have a much greater understanding of what he wants to do, and I’m as giddy as a kid on Christmas at the knowledge that this idea of his has turned into a full blown new company. The idea that I get to help develop a brand new RPG excited me so much that for hours before we hit $13,000, my girlfriend would have to drag me away from hitting ‘refresh’ over and over again on the computer. I can’t thank all of you enough for this. This game is going to happen, and it’s all because of you. Every single pledge that bumped up that goal to $13,000 and beyond is your doing. Josh has revealed to me a lot about the world, the system, and the future of the game, and I can’t wait to share some of that information with all of you. I read the forums every day to see all of your theories, your thoughts on the paradigms, and I am absolutely giddy. It’s a feeling I’ve had in the past, GMing a Pathfinder or D&amp;D game, knowing that in the next room what the players would find was going to shock and awe them. The level of this feeling has reached such a greater height with the Quantum Roleplaying Game that I’m having a hard time expressing it into words. What you don’t yet know about Quantum is going to amaze you. I can’t wait to see your reactions and get to work with your feedback on developing this game. Thank you all so much for making the Quantum RPG happen! It would not be possible without you. Blake Davis Developer We did it! YOU did it! Let's keep going! I cut this video together really fast, so please excuse the buzzing background noise of the onboard sound with my camera. Normally I record the audio separate and sync it but I wanted to get this out in a hurry! :-) Also please excuse the sometimes jarring jump cuts. Thank you so very much, everyone! The response has been phenomenal so far and I couldn't be happier than I am right now. We're cruising along to $13K at a brisk pace with no signs of slowing. I did hear a lot of requests for new high-level backer rewards, so those have been added. Look for [New!] next to the title of the reward. I also received requests for Retail Backer Rewards, so those have been added as well. They have [New!] and [RETAIL] next to their titles and, obviously, are for qualified US retailers and international retailers with US freight forwarding only. Please take a moment to let your local hobby, game, or book store know about this project so they can get on board. Right now, backing the Kickstarter project is the only way for a retailer to have copies of the Quantum RPG in their store on the release date. Lastly, I asked on my Facebook author page and on the Infinite X Studio Facebook page what direction I should go with the next video update on Monday. Overwhelmingly I heard you say, "TELL US ABOUT THE ENGINE! LET'S SEE WHAT'S UNDER THE HOOD!" so your wish is my command. On Monday I will dig deep into the system, show you the basics, run you through a few combat rounds, and preview one of the finished Paradigms, the Archer. There will be some Quantum world stuff mixed in since the rules and setting are blended, but this will mostly be what you want--a rules preview. :-) Again, thank you so much for your support. Please take a moment to spread the word again by posting a link to the main Kickstarter page on your Facebook wall, or emailing the link to your gaming friends, or standing on a busy street corner shouting about it. (Okay, maybe not the last one!) Take care, Joshua J. Frost
