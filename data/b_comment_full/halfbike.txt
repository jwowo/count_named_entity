Dear Halfbikers, You've made it really busy for us in the months after the campaign and we are very happy to announce that All Halfbikes are finally on their way. Hooray! As of today most of them have already arrived and the rest will do so in the next few days. We would love to know what do you think about your new Halfbike and how does riding it feels. Pics and videos are of course most welcome and would be very helpful to us. Being able to see you ride your Halfbike would be a bliss for us:) Tracking is available for all shipments. So if for some reason you haven't received a tracking number yet, it's just a technical issue. Just give us an email and we'll send it right away. If you're experiencing any troubles, have a question or just want to say hi, give us an email to either <email> or <email> Thank you all for making this possible! It's a dream come true for us! The Halfbike Team This is the last thing we saw of them: P.S. Once we get our senses back we'll take the time and prepare an update covering everything we've been through for the past several months in detail. You know, all the things that we were unable to share with you just because we were too busy making bikes :) Hello, everyone! We are proud to announce that Mission Amsterdam is accomplished :) Not only that we rode a halfbike in the most bike friendly city in the world but we also had the chance to meet with our backers that live there and deliver their Halfbikes in person. Being able to see their reaction was something that we had only hoped for :) We had a terrific time there and would like to thank you all for making the trip possible! Despite having that much fun we thought it would be a shame to ride just in Amsterdam. So we made a little road trip through Central Europe. At the same time a huge bike-show called Eurobike was taking place in southwestern Germany right next to the Swiss border so this pretty much determined the route. We've already mentioned that we visited a total of seven capitals along the way. More specifically Amsterdam, Berlin, Vienna, Prague, Budapest, Ljubljana and Zagreb. We were very close to making them eight but appalling weather kept us from stopping in Bratislava :( Here is a glimpse of what it was like riding there. Enjoy! And just a small production update. All the components have arrived at last! (Even the long-awaited trucks.) We are now working frantically to finish the bikes and ship them by the end of the month as promised. With a bit of luck we might actually make it so stay tuned :) Dear Halfbikers, Since the start of the campaign many of you stepped in with great suggestions and comments on how to improve the Halfbike. While waiting for all components to arrive we took the time to go through all ideas, sift out the best ones and find a way to implement them. Now the Halfbike accommodates the ideas we felt are making it even better. Apart from the minor tweaks and adjustments we did to fine tune the Halfbike there are a few changes that we would like to point out: - First and most notable - redesigned collapsible handlebar. - We've added a chainguard. - Hollow axle crankset with outside bearings (both lighter and more durable). - Light reflecting strips on the front tire and pedals for additional safety. - Slick rear tires. - Ah, we've also added a seat... Just kidding. And here is what it looks like and functions now :) The specs have also changed a bit: We want you to be the first to know about the "new" Halfbike. In the days to come we'll be posting some more photos on the website as well as on our Facebook page. You can check them out if you are curious. And again if you have any comments, thoughts or like to tell us something we would love to hear it :) Dear Backers, We are very happy to announce that the first rewards are on their way, hooray! Making the T-shirts was certainly a lot of fun and we've made you this short video just to get you a glimpse of the process. We've put quite a lot of T-shirts and even more stickers into that many envelopes and after making several trips to the post office everything is on its way now! We had friends and family helping out with folding, labeling and packaging and even still it took us good 3 days to complete. We really hope you like the rewards as much as we enjoyed making them! Now that this is done we can really focus on the Halfbikes. All major components are already on their way. We'll use the time before the bits and pieces start arriving to finish the design of the bike so once we've got everything we can start the actual production. The two aspects of the design and functionality that we are tinkering are integrating gears and a collapse-able handlebar. We are still testing them but so far both look promising :) We'll soon unveil the "new" Halfbike and would very much like to hear your impressions. Any comments, thoughts and opinions would be very helpful. Hopefully the design will be all done within the next several weeks and we can start manufacturing the frames and handlebars. P.S. Pictures of you with the rewards would be most welcome. We would love to see the faces of all the people who helped turn the project into reality. We can also use the photos for a little side project :) Cheers :) Thank you so much! We've done it. Thanks to your help and support Halfbike is going into production. Your reactions and feedback has been incredibly encouraging. It's been quite a month for us and we're delighted that Halfbike will now join the variety of human powered vehicles and enrich contemporary bike culture. Now we are keen to know more about the people who made all this possible so we'll be sending out emails / surveys to you over the next few weeks. This would allow us to gather all necessary information we need to fulfill your rewards. We're in for a lot of work in the months to come but we are quite enthusiastic. You should also expect updates whenever the project reach a milestone or we just want to say hi :) We look forward to getting your Halfbikes out to you in a few months. And most of all hear back from you how it really felt :). Meanwhile if you have any questions, comments or feedback please send us a message or a mail. We'll be more than happy to stay in touch. You turned our world upside down! Thank you! Thank you! <url>"Mission Amsterdam"! This means that we are going (most likely in July) to try out the Halfbike and present it to the world's most bike friendly city. Backers living close by or anyone else who wants to come to Amsterdam are more than welcome to join us. We will be very happy to meet the people who made this possible. We can also bring along your rewards so you can receive them in person. Seeing you ride a Halfbike for the first time and hearing back from you would be priceless. How does it sound? Hello Halfbikers, it's been a while since the last update. If you are wondering what we've been doing lately here is a hint: we've been thinking how to better suite your halfbikes to your specific needs. We know that the variety of possible uses is endless and would very much like if anyone can personalize their ride. We are currently developing a range of add-ons and accessories that could be easily added to a halfbike. Imagine them like a new set of clothes that could be changed whenever you like.Things like a foldable handlebar, rain kit, integrated lights, luggage rack, gears, electric pedal assist etc. We think that the best thing about the campaign by far is the community that has been born and would like to make all this with you guys taking part at every step along the way. Join the discussion and help us make your halfbikes fit you like a glove! Sounds a bit frightening right? Well not to English adventurer Dave Cornthwaite . We've got great news guys, Dave wants to travel more than a 1000 miles by Halfbike as a part of his expedition 1000 ( 25 journeys of 1000 miles or more, each using a different form of non-motorized transport ). It's really hard to describe how excited we are right now. We can't wait to make it happen! And you? <url>
