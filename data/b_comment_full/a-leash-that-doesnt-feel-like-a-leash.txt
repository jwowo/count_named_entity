I never recieved my order Wondering how these are being shipped and if a tracking numbers are available? I see some have arrived. I haven't got a tracking number yet, should I be worried? Backer #152. Got mine in the mail today (Canada). Love the purple colour btw. My puppy is trying to figure it out - should be a fun lewrning experience. The two of them instantly loved the giraffe toy. Can't wait to show off this cool KS project. Do you have a place we should post pics - like a hash tag or account? My leash came today. My dog loves it, but during our first walk, she bit the clip portion holding the toy on and it cracked apart already. It was a great leash for about 10 minutes. :-/ So excited!! I actually showed the Kickstarter page to Harley's trainer and the trainer and her team are excited and want to see the leash when we get it! Is everything on track for shipping this month? Really excited to use this with my dog! I never received the survey to choose which toy Hi there, when I backed the project I thought I'd be sending it to the US, but want to ship this internationally instead - how can I change this? Thanks! So excited for your project! Cooper will be modeling his leash! Tashi, my english lab black pup, is bouncing with excitement.� Would love to see a dragon or unicorn in the toy selection options. � I have 2 goldens and I can't wait to use this to keep working on their manners. At 14 mths and 3 mths they r a cute handful. What kinds of toy animals and colors are available so far, and would you be open to suggestions/requests from backers in the future? I'd love to have my Ringo carry a cute little fox with him on walks, for example! I just pledged and it didn't ask me for my address for shipping. Where do I provide my shipping address? Woohoo! So excited to see this come to life! Beautiful video. Can't wait to get one for Banks :)
