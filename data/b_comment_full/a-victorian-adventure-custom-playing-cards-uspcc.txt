Hi gang, it's been a while since this project ended and I don't want you to think that because I don't post weekly updates to tell you how wonderful the weather is here in Pennsylvania or how Bessie the cow had a healthy calf last week, that nothing is progressing. The thing is that the process is straight forward, but there are expected issues sometimes with design that have to be tweeked. While the cards are great, the tuck box had to be touched up a little. Some very fine line issues, spacing to the folds and the required verbage for USPCC had to be modified. But after two attempts I made all the necessary corrections. Will you notice a difference? Not unless you have a microscope, but I'm told that these little details are what makes the quality of the deck. And here I thought it was just how cool the cards were. Pressing on, all is good here. Thanks again for your support! Don't forget to check out another deck I designed and is currently being offered through Man Made Games: <url>"Ponder the Mystery" and I was very excited to give a deck from my first Kickstarter project called Zombie Origin. To be honest, he gave a Spocklike response to it with a raised eyebrow and an odd look, I wondered if he in fact was pondering the mysterious deck I handed him. Also, for those of you who are receiving this deck, it was deck number 007. Sorry for those of you that are not getting the deck, all the decks have been spoken for and are being mailed all week long to the people who pledged on the project and a few select folks which include some celebrities (Andrew McCarthy is not getting one, he was nice enough to spend a little time with at the show, but he was not at all interested in playing cards. Perhaps if I created a Mannequin deck he'd change his mind). :) Thanks for reading this non-project related update. It's just very exciting for a start up card making company to share it's products with people they have idolized and who have formed some of the way I see things. I will be posting a full uncut sheet view of the deck this week. Stay tuned. This is the third and final deck I am producing on my own. After this one I will be producing decks for Man Made Games. I wanted to do one more that was truly by my own design and vision. Some of you may ask why I didn't make a Bicycle deck??? To be honest, the aesthetics didn't suit the Logo requirements (in other words, the deck wouldn't look good with Bicycle written across the top). However, I appreciate the outstanding services that USPCC provides, and the quality that so many Bicycle deck enthusiasts demand. I have a lot I will add regarding this project as time goes by. Again, thank you everyone for your ongoing support of my decks. Alex
