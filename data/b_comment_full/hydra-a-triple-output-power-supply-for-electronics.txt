My Hydra still works. I used the Redshift Serial Interface V3.1.5 for controlling it via Usb. <url>"damnit, where's my Hydra". Hard not to be a little frustrated as it was due in April, and I just blew something up (my own stupidity) by trying to improvise a Hydra. Caleb I'm holding you accountable for letting the smoke out of my UCC37321P, may it weigh heavily on your conscience ;) I just hooked up my Hydra tonight and have to say it is pretty friggin amazing. This is one slick product you have here. I really hope this sells well for you. /thumbsup Hi Caleb, Still awaiting word on my Hydra with bluetooth expansion board(^-^) The Oct 31 update indicated all would be shipped by the following week -was that the case? Thanks in advance for your reply. Congrats on the Project. Larry Any update on the bluetooth expansion boards? I've received my Blue Hydra and so far it looks nice. I am using a mac and attempting to use the driver and Hydra program on a VMware installation of win Vista has resulted in two BSODs. Is there a timeline as to when we will be able to use the Smart Power Supply Control Software natively on OSX ? Any update on the Bluetooth modules? I'd love to have my Hydra to use... Hi Caleb. My black Hydra landed in my hands yesterday. I'm in Italy. I had to pay about $35 in vat and taxes. I'm VERY happy for the product. thanks. Mario Hi Caleb.. I just started Electrical Engineering and I'm wondering if it was possible to use the Hydra for KCL experiments. I've been given the impression in my lectures that having 2 or more different voltage sources connected in series is a bad thing, perhaps I've misinterpreted the forewarning but in anycase, is there anything I need to know before I put 2 or 3 voltage sources in my circuit using the Hydra? Hi Caleb, mine just arrived in the Netherlands. Congratulations on finishing this project, it must at times have seemed an endless journey for you. It's even smaller than I imagined it. Only one word applies: AWESOME! Look forward to using it in my next project. Caleb. Hi from Sweden, wanted to let you know mine arrived, perfect condition. 70 dollars (440SEK) of import tax (darn government). Used it for the first time today. Fantastic case, love the material, finish looks and feels bomb proof. The software works well, great to see the videos online. Downloaded the instructions, well written and complete. Good luck for the future, thanks for you and your colleagues hard work. I have now used it, and it's... BADASS! I used it for a custom photo box, I have it controlling 3 different lights, LOVE IT! PWM would of been even better though. I received mine, but haven't had time to even unpack the box, but I appreciate it and it looks great! Sweet...my Hydra showed up yesterday and works great. I have already put it to work powering my project: "The Phone Cop" Thanks. Any one know of some low profile banana plugs that would work well with this? Caleb, I've already received my Hydra and it looks so cool... Unfortunately I don't have a windows box. Is there a way to just purchase the Bluetooth/Wifi module so I can use an iOS/Android device? Thanks! Thanks for such a nice product, Caleb. Just got mine, and it's working flawlessly. A few months ago you mentioned it'd be possible to monitor status via the serial connection. What is the speed of the connection? I tried 38400 (and everything from 9600 to 115200), 8N1, no control flow, and I only get garbage. Seems it is outputting something, but I'm not being able to read it properly. Being an aussie, the power adaptor will not be compatible for me, without an adaptor for Australia. Are these kind of things standard? I'd prefer to slot out the US based one, and replace with the AU version, rather than a bulky international travel adapter is that is possible. Will have a chance to change my shipping address if I recently moved? Caleb - I was wondering if you were still planning on producing a WiFi control module? I know it was tied to a $100k stretch goal, but wasn't sure if that product was still on the table as a future add-on even if you didn't reach the funding goal. The wording on the website would lead me to think that it does include Bluetooth. It says so twice in the description, and I don't see anything that would imply there exists a non-Bluetooth Hydra (or an add-on Bluetooth module). It also says (twice) that they will ship in July. The pricing appears to have been updated recently though - it shows $198 to me. I am confused about the website description. I though the Hydra retail price was to be $200, but the website shows its $179? Also the description shows that the Hydra includes bluetooth communication under the $179 price point. With the shop hardware repaired and operational again, is there a light at the end of the tunnel now? (and not the oncoming train variety) how about an update? I'm excited for the new Case! any updates? its been 2 weeks. almost forgot i backed this project. So it is May 30th guys, what is the status of things? :) Just a question, don't you need above 14V oftentimes to charge a SLA (14.7V)? <url>#) and maybe able to re-use the data communication code. Well, if you are going to really put more than a few seconds of thought into your application's UI, then you might as well do it right... Segoe UI is the standard font for Windows 7 and Windows 8, as well as Office 2013. Segoe UI should be used for primary UI elements such as buttons, dropdowns, etc. For short sections of editable text, you should be using Calibri. If you have large sections of text (more than a paragraph or so), then Cambria is what should be used. Windows 8 UI Guidelines (typography): <url>"Modern" layout): <url>"official" guidance for Desktop apps, but most seem to be adopting something that very closely resembles the guidelines for Modern Windows Store Apps in my second link. Caleb, I'd recommend a monospace sans-serif (equal width per letter/character, and no extra decorations). Consolas looks like a decent compromise of computery/LCD feel while being modern and readable: <url>"instructions" I use to be into Arduino then I moved into CNC stuff and it all just sits in a container awaiting my return. Great job on fast responses BTW, it pays off, trust me. :) I understand the "official stuff", how about a schematic, and free software, or? hi! i was planning to use this as a roaming pwr supply for my old arcade and PC's machines while i'm repairing them. The supplies are generally in a horrid spot and a pain in the neck to get to, so this would solve a lot of fiddling. Any chance you could set the voltages to minus ranges? (i.e. the boards require a -5v and -12v range too) thanks! "expansion board with control knobs and even a small display to show the output and input voltage/current levels. Would this interest you?" DEFINITELY! Since your limiting this to Bluetooth 4.0, that stops about 75% of us from using it away from the PC, which is a HUGE drawback, and controlling from Bluetooth was actually the ONLY reason I pledged, then I found out about the 4.0 deal and downgraded my pledge in hopes that you find a solution for it, The idea is AWESOME, but if I can't use it the way I want/understood then.... Does it act like a Faraday cage in someway aswell? Can an open frame be made available at a lower cost. Lowering the cost would make them practical to leave behind with each project, and then buy a new one for your next project. Put your logo on the silk screen. What level of security will there be on the bluetooth expansion? How much trouble would a third party have to go through in order to modify someone else's voltage settings via bluetooth? Regarding my list of other questions (below), if you've got a forthcoming spec sheet that will cover it, then rough answers are fine. Very cool item. I really like the feature set. Perhaps my only wish was that the price was a little more accessible to hobbyists. Anyhow, my own questions: 1. How is the conversion efficiency? Are there particular weak or strong spots in the efficiency curve? 2. How fast can I alter or duty cycle an output? (What is the maximum rate you can send changes, and what is the typical/maximum delay for the new voltage to be realized in the output?) 3. What happens when I draw too much current? Voltage sag? Timed breaker? Software controlled breaker? Breaker flipped until the unit resets? 4. Since it has a battery charging mode, I'm guessing that feeding outside voltages into the outputs won't hurt it? Even if they mismatch? 5. I wish the voltage output cap of 12v was just a little bit higher. Will it be able to effectively charge 12v batteries? 6. Is there a provision for input, output, or other status monitoring? 7. Environmental operating range? Temperature, humidity? Thanks. I agree with Kenneth, Functionality is why we are all here. Instead of colors, how about adding the ability to series and parallel the outputs? That would be more useful. I see. From the pictures the tinned lines looked like cut-outs! ~Thanks Great product! Can you explain the PCB mounting concept. It's hard to gather from the pictures. The board shape seems deliberately frail. Did a consolidated board shape suffer noise problems? What is ripple at 2.5A? (The listed max current at 5V)
