iPhone App I'm pleased to announce that the Hydra iPhone App is now available for download from the app store. The app is, of course, free to download and use. You can download it at the following link, or you can find it by searching for "Hydra Power Supply" from the app store on your phone. <url>"Resources" that describes how to use the expansion board. Rewards By now, everyone should have received their rewards. If you haven't, please contact me right away and I'll help you out. With only a handful of exceptions, all Kickstarter pre-orders have now shipped. The mobile apps are coming soon. The Hydra can now be purchased on our website, and we are offering a 32% discount on the regular price between now and January 1st, 2014. For those interested in buying more, this would be a great time to buy!

Unsupported Baud Rates This represents a rather large oversight on my part, but it appears that the baud rate that the Hydras have been using by default is not supported by most serial port hardware. This hasn't been a problem on our Windows machines, probably because Windows emulates baud rates that aren't supported by hardware (I'm actually not sure why it works, but this is my best guess). Because it works on Windows, this problem only affects users who want to connect using a serial terminal on OS-X or Linux. The Fix We are changing the default baud rate to 9600, which is a very common standard, for all Hydras that are shipping from now on. The PC software will automatically select the correct baud rate, so this will only affect backers who want to control the Hydra from a serial terminal. If you already have your Hydra, the baud rate is 14400. If you haven't received it yet, the baud rate will be 9600. What if I Want a Hydra with the New Baud Rate? If you already have your Hydra and you want one with the more standard 9600 baud rate, then please contact me and let me know. I'll arrange to have a shipping label sent to you so that we can reprogram your Hydra with the correct baud rate. Shipping This week we shipped a little under 100 Hydras from the $169 and $189 reward tiers. As mentioned earlier, we don't have the blue enclosures back from the anodization house yet, so we've only shipped red and black enclosures so far. I included a bunch of pictures below. Enjoy! Testing and Calibration Forgive me for posting so many updates in quick succession, but I thought some of you might be interested to see what we do to test and calibrate the Hydras to get them ready to ship. Each Hydra is a little different - part tolerances cause the outputs to vary a little from what they are expected to be, so to get the best accuracy we run each Hydra through an automated test cycle that measures the outputs and computes calibration terms. I made a brief video showing how it works: <url>"guts" of the tapping tool are ruined (they looked good to me), we'll be tapping holes again by the end of Thursday. In the mean-time, the holes in the enclosures need to be enlarged by quite a bit, and we have a lot more machining to do. So not too much time has been lost. A Quick Change of Plans Hey everyone. In my last update, I indicated that because we were having trouble tapping the holes on the already-anodized parts, we were probably going to glue them. Enough people have responded negatively to that idea that we've changed our minds. We'll make sure the holes get tapped even if we have to do it by hand. That is all for today. Thanks everyone. Hey everyone, A lot has happened and it is time for another update. To summarize, we are in the home stretch and things are moving quickly. There have been a few problems that we are working through, but they aren't deal-breakers and they haven't added too much time to the delivery dates. The Good Our first batch of 100 enclosures is anodized, engraved and mostly ready to go. We produce a lot of aluminum shavings! The Bad We are close, but the one caveat is that we've had trouble threading the holes for putting the enclosures together. We have a tapping tool and a little jig for holding the enclosures in place during tapping, but we keep breaking taps - so far, about one tap per enclosure breaks. And at $15 a pop, that really adds up! I'm guessing that the taps are breaking for two reasons. First, I think that the jig isn't holding them in place perfectly. When the part shifts, the tap breaks. Second, I think that the drill press can't go slowly enough for the size of tap we are using. The solution is a two-part process. First, I'm tooling up to cut the threads on the mill instead of the drill press. This will allow us to get the correct spindle speed, the parts will be clamped down tightly, and the CNC mill will allow the tap to be positioned right where it needs to be. I honestly don't know if this will fix the problem, but odds are in its favor. Unfortunately, the enclosures that are already anodized and engraved can't be tapped on the mill because the jaws will scratch the dye. I think that the only viable solution for these first enclosures will be to glue them together using some kind of flexible urethane adhesive. It will be more difficult to take the enclosures apart if needed, but it won't be impossible. It will also leave the screw holes in the bottom empty. This naturally won't affect functionality, but it won't look as polished. The Ugly Last week the CNC machine was running full tilt, churning through aluminum at 60 inches per minute and 4000 RPM. Suddenly, without warning, the tool holder dropped right out of the spindle. In the mayhem that followed, the end mill (operating under its own angular momentum) drilled through the aluminum and into the vice. Meanwhile, the toolholder started wobbling back and forth like a top. It rubbed on the spindle and got so hot that it blued the steel! Amazingly, nothing was significantly damaged - not even the end mill broke, and some emery cloth and a polishing wheel put the tool holder back into service. Here was the culprit that caused the problem: The drawbar, shown above, is a long metal rod that extends from the top of the spindle, down through its center, and all the way to the taper that mates with the tool holder. The threads shown above screw into the tool holder to keep it attached to the spindle taper. Upon investigation, it was discovered that only two and a half threads were screwing into the tool holder. And, as you can see, those threads were completely worn out. They basically weren't even there anymore. We fixed it by cutting off all the threads using our lathe. We then welded the threads from a bolt onto the base of the drawbar. We extended the drawbar so that between five and six threads are used now instead of less than three. The mill is running again and it is working well. It set us behind about a week on the enclosure manufacturing, but a side benefit is that while investigating the problem, I figured out why our spindle break wasn't working and fixed it. That should speed things up a little during tool changes. Thanks, everyone. We are plugging away. I tire of posting updates about delays and problems, probably even more than you tire of reading them. We really are in the home stretch, though, and nothing is going to keep us from shipping these out! I'll keep you apprised. Assembled Hydras We now have 533 Hydras PCBs assembled and ready to go. They haven't all been functionally tested yet, but they've each passed a careful visual inspection under our stereo microscope. We have a little under 300 more coming from the assembly house soon. Their pick-and-place machine died and they are working on getting it repaired. Fortunately, we have enough boards on-hand to meet all Kickstarter rewards. Enclosures The aluminum enclosure is now the long-pole in getting the shipments out. I expect to be able to complete and ship 100 a week starting at the end of next week. Thanks so much for your patience. We are more behind than I ever wanted to be, but the light is shining at the end of the tunnel. This project really couldn't have succeeded without all of your help. Mounting Tabs A while ago I slightly modified the Hydra enclosure design so that it has small mounting tabs on the sides. I realized that I haven't really told anyone, so here is what the new design looks like: The enclosure above is unfinished and it isn't anodized yet, but this should give you the idea. The new mounting tabs will make it a lot easier to use the Hydra on mobile platforms. Also, the tabs remove the need for the special mounting brackets that were promised in one of our stretch goals. Circuit Boards We are having 800 Hydras made (there were a little over 400 promised via Kickstarter pledges, so this will give us a healthy inventory to work from). Some of them are shown below. This is just a small fraction of what we've received, but we discovered that a number of "do not populate" components in our Bill of Materials were populated anyway. So we have to remove them - the above boards are ready to go following our post-assembly component removal. PCB Assembly Update Assembled PCBs are finally starting to trickle in from the assembly house. They shipped 16 on Wednesday, 33 yesterday, and they say that the remainder will be shipped before the end of next week. So far the quality looks reasonable. A couple had minor cold solder joints on some parts, and another had unconnected pads on one of the ICs. As they arrive, we'll be inspecting each one carefully to make sure that we catch any obvious problems before programming and testing them. We are in the process of finalizing the packaging for shipping the Hydra and its accessories. Taking into account the cost of cutting dies, printing, and minimum order quantities, it gets pretty expensive, but I think it is worth it. We really want a nice, professional solution. I've included a couple of pictures of what we have so far. The Hydra sits inside an insert inside the box as shown below (the Hydra shown is unfinished - the packaging looks a lot better with a black enclosure to contrast with the white box). Underneath the insert, there is enough space to hold the power supply, the USB cable and alligator clips, and the screwdriver for the screw terminals. The Bluetooth expansion board (not shown) will also fit in the compartment underneath. The box is a made out of B-flute cardboard, so with the addition of a thin sheet of packing material above the top insert, it should protect the contents well enough to allow us to ship without an extra shipping box. For international orders, we might put the whole box inside a big padded envelope to offer a little more protection. And that's that! Lead-time for these is about two weeks, and we are about to place the order. If the packaging holds up orders, we can ship using something less professional, but I'm pretty sure that packaging won't be the long pole when it comes to actual shipment dates. We've had a lot of requests for updates, so here is the latest. PCB Assembly We dropped off the PCBs and parts at our PCB assembly house a little under 5 weeks ago. The lead-time was 3 weeks, but if I've learned anything, it is that PCB assembly houses often underestimate lead-times. That has been my experience, at least, which is why we try to do as much in-house assembly as possible - lead-times are much more predictable. I just got off the phone with them and they are promising that the boards will be delivered by Friday of next week (June 7th). Assuming that they deliver when they promised, assuming that there are no big problems with the assembled boards, and allowing a week for testing, we could conceivably start shipping by June 14th. More conservatively, it is likely that shipments will start going out in earnest sometime between the 14th and the 28th of June. I wish I could promise that they would ship sooner. In the mean-time, let me know if your address changes, so that I can make sure your Hydra ships to the right address. Increasing the Output Voltage Range When we started assembling Hydras in bulk, we noticed some problems that I probably should have anticipated but didn't. When stacking the tolerances for all the parts that affect the output voltage together, sometimes they combine to limit the output voltage range too much. For example, the lowest possible output voltage is often above 3.0V and below 12.0V. To correct this problem, I've had to redesign the supplies so that their theoretical output voltage range is well beyond the 3V to 12V specification. Then, during programming, testing, and calibration, the firmware is adjusted so that the supply knows how to reach the proper output voltages given the non-ideal components on the board. I've also taken the opportunity to expand the maximum output voltage of the supply to close to 14 V (14V is the theoretical maximum, but component tolerances will probably lower it a bit). Without the higher output voltage range, the Hydra would be unable to charge 12V lead-acid batteries. So this should be helpful. Assembly Timeline From the beginning, we intended to do the PCB assembly for the Hydra in-house. We manufacture all of our existing products in-house, and that allows us to control quality and to be intimately familiar with the process and lead-times. We've found, however, that assembling the Hydra takes a LOT longer than any of our existing products, and we don't have a pick and place machine to speed things up (not yet). Even after optimizing our line, we've only been able to assemble 8 Hydras a day on average. I thought that building the enclosures might be our biggest bottleneck, but we can do about 8 of those per HOUR - so assembling the circuit boards is taking a lot longer than expected. The result: we are going to outsource the rest of the PCB assembly to a local shop that has a pick and place machine and other nice equipment. The best lead-time so far is 3 weeks. What this means is that all the Hydra shipments are going to be at least a month late. This represents lack of foresight on my part. I apologize. But don't worry - we are hard at work and you will definitely receive your fully-functional Hydra in the near future. I'll keep you apprised of our progress. Please contact me if you have any questions. ESD Tests Today, with the help of a friend with some nice equipment, we did ESD tests on the exposed pins of the Hydra and on the enclosure itself. We blasted each pin multiple times with both positive and negative 8kV, and at one point we even generated a half inch arc from the ESD gun to an exposed pin. I'm pleased to report that the Hydra still functions as happily as ever! We'll probably give it another go and crank it up to +/- 16kV to really put the ESD protection circuitry to the test, but surviving multiple hits at +/- 8kV is actually pretty good. ESD Test Bench Manufacturing We've made some progress on the manufacturing front as well. We did a test manufacturing run of 10 Hydras and identified some issues with our reflow profile that prevented the power inductors from being soldered correctly. They are so big they tend to soak up the heat and prevent reflow. It wasn't immediately obvious that there was a problem, but underneath the inductors the solder paste would flow around and sometimes short the two inductor pads together. The result? When the buck-boost converter turned on it would drive high currents through a short and destroy itself. We've figured out a better way to handle the inductors, so this won't be a problem in the future. Using a serial terminal to control the Hydra I just recorded a new video demonstrating how to control the Hydra from a serial terminal. Have a look! Panelized PCBs Have Arrived I miscalculated and this took longer than anticipated, but we've finally received the final revision of the Hydra PCB, panelized and ready to go. The stencil should arrive on Thursday, and then we'll have everything we need to start manufacturing in earnest. Thanks everyone for your patience. Here they are in all their gold-plated glory! Bluetooth Expansion Board The finalized Bluetooth expansion board design is ready and is shown below: We are using an OEM Bluetooth module from China to keep the costs reasonable. The downside is that the factory lead-time is fairly long. We don't expect to have all the parts for the Bluetooth expansion for another two weeks. The implication is that we probably won't be able to get most of the expansion boards delivered until next month. I'm sorry that we are behind - this is principally a result of poor planning on my part. I didn't anticipate the long lead-times. I'll keep you updated as we go. Please contact me if you have any questions. The parts have started to arrive! The aluminum stock for milling the Hydra enclosures arrived yesterday, and today we received most of the parts we need to start assembling the PCBs. I did a rush order on a new PCB revision and it should be here tomorrow. I'll test it over the weekend and make the production PCB order on Monday. Because we can expect at least a week lead-time for the production PCBs, we are a going to be a little behind on assembling the actual circuit boards. We'll definitely start shipping finished supplies before the end of April, but there is a chance that some won't go out until May. I'm going to do everything I can to get us back on schedule. While we wait for the PCBs, though, we'll be setting up our test fixture for programming, testing, and calibrating each Hydra. I'll send more updates as we make progress. Half a ton of aluminum stock Electronic Components Thank You! 479 backers 921% funded at $92,154 Thanks to everyone for your support. We are excited by the amount of interest the Hydra has generated, and we are working hard to manufacture the Hydras and get them ready to go. Aside from building the boards and the enclosures, we'll be manufacturing test fixtures to automate the program/test process, to "shake test" the Hydras to make sure they work after being exposed to vibration, and so on. I've also made some changes to the Hydra design to improve its reliability (more ESD protection, more accurate oscillator for the controller to reduce COM bit errors, etc.) I've made a rush order for the new PCBs so that I can get them tested right away. Thanks again! I'll post updates as we go to keep you in the loop. Hey everyone. I was interviewed on DJ Grandpa's Crib recently to discuss the Hydra Kickstarter campaign. I talk about some of the history behind CH Robotics and the motive for building the Hydra. If you are interested, have a listen! <url>"productized" form. Again, thanks to all those who have participated so far. We are excited to see how things progress from here.
