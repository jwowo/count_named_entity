3YRS past, where is my collar perfect? Hey I never received my collar perfect Hey there, Totally forgot to fill out the survey - just did that now. Brandon - is it too late to receive my 3 collar perfects? Thanks, - Jalal Campaign is a total scam!!! Let me tell you my story. I backed the campaign for two collar perfect which were sent to me (Switzerland) as promised. So far so good, I was looking forward to using them. Next thing I know, the parcel is blocked at customs because it does not have a proper indication of the shipment value. I argued with customs and sent them a copy of the pledge, I asked the creator to intervene without success. Eventually, the parcel gets returned to the sender. And now comes the kicker: the creator wants me to pay for shipping again, even though this was totally their mistake for not including the bill in the parcel or making a proper customs declaration. I emailed them multiple times with no response other than "we'll send it back when you pay for shipping again". I emailed Kickstarter support to no effect. Bottom line: reward still not received and never going to be received. Creator is non responsive to any of my emails. SCAM! Hello, I am still waiting my collar perfect. Please contact me, thanks. I found a great convenient n quick way of ironing Everlast Boxing Hand Wraps using Collar Perfect after each wash. Hi... I am yet to receive my product... is there anyone else who is still waiting for theirs? Collar Perfect Team, please update me on what the situation of my shipment is please. @Brandon and everybody else wondering. I can confirm that all 3 units worked perfectly fine at 220V. I had to use an adapter but it's not an overly powerful iron and doesn't draw that much so any good quality adapter should be fine. I plugged it in and it worked like it did on my 110V line. I received my collar perfect... but i can't use it in the Netherlands... because it has the wrong voltage and plug.. :S :S That was quick! All three units arrived in perfect conditions in Brazil. I'm a little worried though - the manual says 110/220 but on the iron itself it's written 100-120. I travel to places that are 110, some that are 220 and here at home it's 220. Now I don't know which one to trust - the manual or the iron. I got one with the US power cord which is fine because it's easier to plug it into my outlets, does this mean that they're strictly 110V? I received all 3 units in great retail packaging. Hasn't test it yet. But looks totally awesome. Got mine in Canada. Looks and feels good. Worked great on my test shirt. Look forward to more testing! Received mine in Canada.... V nice design and works quite well.. Good instructions sheet... Has various heatt/material settings.... Takes some practice to use it as a clamp in the air without a flat surface... but great to have the option to switch to traditional iron Great compact size and absolutely perfect size for travel without bulk at all... Wonderful work and great price for this gadget.. Got my product and it seems to work well, but it will take a bit of time to use it more efficiently. Thanks. Received today in Australia. Looking forward to using this on my trip to Japan :) One question though. Australia has 220-240v mains and the Collar Perfect rates at 110-220v. Will the unit work without damaging it...? Received today in Spain. Bravo!! I will put an adapter plug and "et voil√†". Tonight will test. Thaks. Same as Keith below, mine arrived today with US power adaptor despite being a UK customer... Hi, I received mine today, I ordered 3 units, all have arrived with non removable US power adaptors, I am an international customer, why did these not have the UK plug on them? just got mine today and love it so small and heats up very fast. so amazing been waiting to this since i saw it on kickstarter. Great work! :) Why is my item in Puerto Rico presently when it shipped form Michigan????? @Brandon I haven't received any emails containing a tracking number. Could you please manually email one to me? Looking forward to recieving the final product! Thanks, Trevor Product appears to work as intended. This is great news. Only two things that concern me is the mention of lead in the instructions along with the cancer warning (for the wire coating? but this may be normal in all products?) and the chemical smell while heating up. Hoping the smell is just from being used for the first time and that it goes away after repeated uses. Got mine yesterday (Feb 18). I live in Philadelphia. Haven't tested it out yet though. I received mine today! Going to test it tonight... Got my shipping notice today! They should have shipped 4 - 5 days ago. Anybody get theirs yet? I'm assuming they didn't ship yet, or there would have been an update. Thanks for the update! Can we update our addresses somewhere? Anyone else seeing Jan 5 as the most recent update? when the shipment would begin? I actually will be leaving to study overseas really soon, so I'd be really happy to give the product a test run and recommend it to others. Can we just simply get a HARD DATE of when you are shipping!! Please! Would be a good time for an update, given that 3rd party QC was supposed to either start or finish today. Was manufacture completed according to the schedule in Update 33? Any way to change my shipping address? As you have pushed back the shipping date yet again, I will no longer be at the same address as I submitted. Can we get a update please. This is becoming very frustrating with the lack of information you are given us. Glad we funded a vacation break earlier this month. No question there have been legitimate obstacles, but the lack of communication has been pretty bad. I don't get it, are we supposed to wait now for 2 months more before we get another update? Agree with the recent comments. In comparison to even the most delayed Kickstarters, this one is missing at least the communication factor. It takes 30 days to deliver overseas!? That is laughable. I have this shipped overseas often for my company and even with FIRST time customs delays (that moves significantly faster the 2nd time and forward) it is never close to 30 days. Eh, kids today. Don't understand the logistics of making new things with new partners. Nomiku 1 was basically a year late. Nomiku 2 was supposed to deliver a month before Collar Perfect, and still not here. Kickstarter is an exercise in managed expectations. Take every delivery date, and increase it by a factor based on the complexity. Pocket Squares... one month late. Third round of underwear, probably on time. Anything more complicated than cutting cloth... expect 3 months to 12. Indy game design... still waiting for Thunderbeam for iPad (I think there have been 4-5 generations of iPad since that one closed). This user's account has been deleted. @creator finally added an update of status report, with suggested timeframe for shipping the product to backers. So if doing simple calculation we are looking at an ETA of the product to backers of another 60-90 days. That puts the project at nearly a year. Should have the title changed to "Collar Perfect: the insanely delayed iron". We'll probably see another unexpected delay in 2 months for something else, and if not it would be nothing short than a miracle. Even if I get this product, there's no way I'll ever back antoher one of this guy's projects again. The delays on this are ridiculous! When will I give up even checking on this product? I think maybe today. It is terrible even by kickstarter standards. Lets all just assume we have been scammed and leave Mr. Dierker alone with our hard earned money in his pockets and be pleasantly surprised if he ever delivers. I was going to keep further inquiries into why my shipment has been interminable delayed, but realized I'm just one of 1277 awaiting the same thing. Guys, calm down. He said they are on vacation until today. That means he won't hear from them until tomorrow, and that's assuming they looked at it during their holidays. At this point what is a few weeks here or there. There have been obvious hurdles but at least they are tackling them. I do agree they haven't been the best with timely communication, but I can tell you for certain they are far from the worst (look at arist for an example of horrible communication). You will get your iron in due time. It was the Chinese holiday, so let's not beat them for things out of their control! October 8 came and went and still no update or comment from the @creator. Why am I not surprised?... Wonder if this will deliver for the holidays. Been almost a year. I, for one, like the new color scheme. Looks a lot less like a toy. Can't wait to get mine! I don't get it, you said updates due in tomorrow that means Saturday, so now it's until next week?? While I do see holidays as obvious delay factor, you did mention the company confirmed updates by Saturday... @creator, where's the promised engineers update and last update and shipping dates?.. No, they've stopped publishing dates, I imagine after missing the first estimated dates. I ordered this last year is it would make an excellent travel companion. It's now been almost 1 year. Is there an estimated backer delivery date?? Something is amiss.. The link you published to the shipment tracking shows est. delivery by Sept. 22 and that it's still in transit... So how is it you already got it? Also, last update shows design pictures not actual product. Please release actual photos we would like to see actual product.. This is getting to be 6 months delay and frankly does not look well. I know projects may have delays but either the factory producing the products is of amateur company or the product itself is to blame. In any event none of this contributes much to the reliability of the entire matter, as all we have till now are some updates and updates of no real data. It begins to feel like a public service office.. ;-) What I fail to understand is that at the beginning of the project, in the video, you already seem to have a working unit, so why the constant issues with design all the sudden? Even if all this is legit, it seems like bad project management. Guys, this should have been already out. Backers should not be forced to wait 6-8 months more than promised shipping time. I seriously beginning of thinking to request a refund ASAP. Its kind of crazy how wrinkled my clothes have gotten. This project estimate a spring debut for shipping models and now we are are 6 months back dated. whats next ? Is Belinda's maiden name possibly Dierker? Seems like people are getting a little "hot under the collar" about how long it's taking. I agree it's a long haul. I wasn't paying attention to the estimated delivery date and actually bought two for my husband for last Christmas (guess my brain's a little wrinkled). I bought two other items at the same time and received delivery of one last November and the other in March. So this does seem like a long haul. However, just wanted to say your iron seems like a really great design and I'm sure it will be well worth the wait. I'm grateful to be part of this whole concept of supporting and benefiting from innovative people like Brandon who put their livelihood and reputations on the line to bring something new and unique to the marketplace. Thanks Brandon! @Creator. So after the 5 unit run (which has finished now?), you will go into full production, right? What is the new estimated shipping date? What's the latest? Shipping was supposed to begin by now according to the adjusted timeline. Any news yet? Has been nearly 2 weeks since last update... @ Jon and @ Ryan, this is a Kickstarter campaign and by the very nature of that there will be delays and setbacks. I agree that this project has continued on quite a while but what good does it do to throw your hands in the air and wail? Over a thousand of us believed in this project and Brandon to begin with or we would not have backed it. Let's hope we see results fairly soon and perhaps Brandon will be able to manage our expectations with delivery-time information. I do believe that would be the respectful and considerate thing to do here. If he doesn't know, it would be far better for him to say that than remain silent. Just sayin'. What say ye, Brandon? I get a strong sense of being swindled. I, for one, do not think I will be backing anymore Kickstarter projects. This seems to be a common occurrence... shipping in March, no June, no December... IF AT ALL! All these complaints and all we get is a picture of a dirty prototype that looks worse than the one we saw the day the project was launched? I am beyond frustrated. I give up on this product. Any update on when we can expect to receive the product? You post lots of updates but do not answer people's questions.... As a backer I would like to know WHY there have been delays and WHEN we can expect the product... Most people don't care about your process or tooling, every update should have some content that gives people an idea of expected delivery... This is getting frustrating @Creator - I also 2nd to what Cullen and rest earlier said. I'm also starting to doubt it myself.. No pictures were/are posted of the samples, and from July 7 till now no real update on the status. We should have better detailed update for the project, more business-wise given that the project's already in months of delay... How about a realistic update as to when products will start shipping? Anyone else starting to seriously doubt we will ever get this? So,When will start shipping? Can i get by August first week? Thanks Brandon - Thank you for staying active in the comments! Little updates like this go a long way. Looking forward to some pictures of the newest samples! Tooling still going well? Any new updates How about "sorry, we're late?" your updates sounds like we should be thankful for backing up your project. 5/18 has passed, 5/19 is halfway through Yes, let's get a shipment update asap please. shipping soon? I hope.. Hello is there estimated date when shipping will start? And can you please post a schedule of the shipping? Does the shipping email mean that you are able to ship this out before June? Thanks, I'm excited to get mine! Can someone help me change my phone number? Can we get a shipping update? Is it possible to change shipping address? Update today? Update? Update please? Hello, It's been a couple weeks and I haven't seen any updates. Can we get a status on where everything is? Would love to know! Congrats Brandon to you and all of the Collar Perfect crew! I wish you much success! Congratulations, I am sure you have a winner. I look forward to your future success. Congratulations! Very exciting! I disagree with the color comments below. I believe the color scheme is great with mostly B&W with a touch of blue markets to female and male customers of all ages. Also it works great with the logo. Don't rush it, take your time evaluating your prototypes. I just want your most satisfied final design. Congratulations! You made it! and We made it too ... AWESOME! congrats... Very close indeed! Getting close now :) Just curious if the reviews you link to, like the one in your most recent update, have actually had an opportunity to use the product or not. Thanks for the clarification Hi Brandon, Can you address the issue with the charging extra shipping fee which was stated as inclusive in the FAQ for KS backers. Prob KS green and white or black would be better This user's account has been deleted. I disagree with the below comments. I think the design and colors look very nice although I personally like green :) I honestly don't know what to do that would help boost the numbers. Maybe the last few days will be good I think @Grid Lau is right...many of my friends i've send the link won't pledge because it looks just one more cheap gadget and that's probably one of the reasons this campaign seems to be stucked...aesthetics is very important in this kind of portable stuff Hi. This product seems useful when I go travel. I back it immediately. To me, the colour of collar seems old fashion. I do not mean to offend you. But would you redesign it's colour into single tone colour like black or white? Product becomes more fancy encourage more supporter. Thx That's great!! Can I use an universal power plug to convert it to 3 pin plug to use in Asian countries ? Reference to @Leewelo reference. And what about removable cable from collar to store easier? 1 part collar 2 part cable. Reference to @Niels cuestion. It's possible to include in the Collar package a simple universal plug converter? will the cable be removable so that we can change the plug without cutting it? What will the plug look like? Will it be 220v with an American plug, or are you gonna adjust it for the international backers. I am sitting here folding laundry for my family and I'm really wanting this little iron for little kid clothes that I refuse to iron the traditional way. My fingers are crossed that this will be funded. All the 'perfect' stuff is getting a bit annoying. Hum ... on the video link today ... care to translate from German? @Ahmed, Creator and their Perfect Engineering team are busy to reviewing and testing the power standards and A/C plug for worldwide user (I guess) Please check below on Sept 17,22,25,29 <url>"unfortunately" patented, it would cause a tons of trouble and would even affect production. I've personally encountered a project due to patent issue with other companies was forced to abandon the project after funding. So copyright issue is no joke in kickstarter and most backers mind. Hope you could clear some doubts and I'll be more than willing to pledge more Collar Prefect for my family and friends. In case you missed it, here's Shabaz comment: @Howard, That is my question asked before. Creator said the prototypes were developed for 110V Line Input for USA markets, i think it will not including Universal plug for his planning. Their Perfect Engineering team need more time to reviewing the voltage and A/C plug for International backer. I have backed the project - for now, with the prospect that a UK adapter may be offered. I like the concept of this product. But I'll be honest - if a UK adapter option (with 220-240v) is not offered in the end, I will have to cancel my pledge. I hope more adapters will be offered to cater for the needs of international backers. This user's account has been deleted. @Creator, The device using US A/C power plug or Universal plug? Great product. Thanks for doing this. @Creator. It seems with 110V, Collar Perfect can be used in certain countries and can't be used in Asia. Any plan to support this countries. Also, what kind of fabric can be used with Collar Perfect? @Brandon (creator), you said you are the founder and inventor of this great innovation/product? Not sure but since I already saw an identical one before, and its hardly 14 USD on amazon.co.jp I thought to share this with fellow backers.
