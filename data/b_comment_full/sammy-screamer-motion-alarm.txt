I know i'm a little in late, but I have not recived my sammy screamer :( I still have not received my Sammy screamer !! I was an original backer - I do not want a new product if I can not get the one I paid for !!!!!! <email> Cool, thanks. Really looks forward to this :) when will you be releasing new great products? I have still to receive my Sammy screamer.. Can you please give an update? Hi, As it appears you already send the Sammy Screamer to most backers, but I am sorry to tell you that I did not get my pledge so far. Could you please help me in this matter? Did you have a problem, sending the pledge to Luxembourg (Europe)? Hello, I want to inquire about the status of my package. I been patiently waiting for my mail but as of now, I still haven't received it yet. Thank you. Everyone. Bleep support resolved my issue in no time. Very professional and quick service. Could not be happier. Thank you bleep customer support. I am reading the updates and this was supplied to be out in April. What is the status? I have received nothing. No emails. No tracking. No package. Still waiting for mine. Delivery timeline or something? I have checked all my folders including spam and still have received nothing. Had one of mine stop working even after the battery was changed. Emailed through the website, but no response. Awaiting my Sammy... OK got Sammy today Hello. I backed this projet on 8 february 2014. I loved the sensor on stroller showed in promotional video even if I had no children. In 2 days my daughter will born and Sammy it not yet here. Awesome. Me too, waiting. They said they sent it to me but no tracking number or a way to know where is it. Spain. >.> still waiting on mine too, Sweden Hello, haven't received anything in Finland yet. I seem to have not received my sammy.. did something go wrong ? Hello guys! Are there any news about the android 5 app? Greetings Christoph Hi. My Sammy screamer disconnects and reconnects every few minutes and I am less them 10 feet from the door. I have reset the device multiple times and have a strong wifi connections. Any suggestions? Thank you. Thank you. I reset Sammy and it is working now. Thank you you again Hi there, Now 20 May and no Bleepers...can I have a tracking number please? Cheers....Mark Can the app turn Sammy Screamer off? I placed the device in sleep mode but the device still makes noise with movement. Is this normal? Thank you. Nothing yet. Belgium...still not arrived. Still waiting in Portugal. Got mine in Thailand. Thank you. Thank you. Received Sammy Screamer in California. Got mine today in Los Angeles, THANKS :) Got it, very cute. Utterly useless until you update the Android app for lollipop. Got mine in Alaska last Friday. Paired flawlessly and impressed the wife. Thanks! Unfortunately I'm still waiting on mine... Wish I had a tracking number Resetting it did the trick. Really cool device. Thanks for the advice. I'm having a problem similar to what Brian described. I have updated to OS 8.3, but still with no resolution. Any suggestions? Okay, I responded too soon. I was running iOS 8.2 still. Once I updated to 8.3 everything was perfect! Great little gadget! So happy I backed. I look forward to the rest of the line of BleepBleeps! Hi there, 7 days from the 24th of April to delivery in New Zealand...today is the 6th of May, not heard a bleep!! Please let me know......cheers received mine in Santa Monica, CA. Working as promised. Nice packaging and easy to pair, manage. Thanks! I received mine today in Ohio. The app recognizes that it's there, but goes into an endless loop of pairing where the little white dots fade back and forth, but the BleepBleep never pairs. Any news about Spanish shipment? I think im the only one in Spain who ordered this Still waiting for mine to arrive in Wisconsin,U.S. Any chance you have tracking information? Arrived in Hong Kong! Thanks! After resetting the Android App I was able to add all three units, but they act not as expected. The first problem is the continuous alert if a sammy is out of range for 1 or 2 hours. The second problem is that it does not reconnect a screamer after it was disconnected. I was contacted by the support so I hope we will find a solution. Arrived in Japan. Thanks. One defective unit received. The other two are not working because the android app seems to be buggy. But after leaving them alone one started a continiues alert and the other in the same interval making a buzzing noise. After resetting the units both had the continiues alert problem. Finally I was forced to remove the batteries. :( Any one got theres from California USA? I know that you are working on an update. When it's ready, it's ready and I think it's better to wait, than getting a fast update with annoying bugs. Sammy arrived in Germany, Hannover. I can't say if it works or not. Now waiting for the app update for Android 5.x. All smartphones in my house are running Android 5.x. Arrived in Germany and works great (with iPhone 4s)! Re Lollipop - I was at first a bit miffed that Sammy couldn't be used immediately but I checked Android and in fact only 5% of the Android user base are on 5.+ (Lollipop) so ok! Any update on US ship dates? Thank you Finally get BleepBleeps today to only discover that i can't use them till end of May because i'm running 5.0. As I'm happy with overall product specially that was made in UK not in RPC i will not moan till end of May. This user's account has been deleted. This user's account has been deleted. No Android 5.x. I hope you will send an Update via Kickstarter, i don't want to miss the App update for my Nexus 5. Until then the sammy will/have to wait in the box. Any tracking code? Hi, Sammy arrived but the App says it isn't compatible with my device. A Sony Z3 compact on Lollipop - which is hardly exotic! When will the android App be updated? Hi... My blue one didn't make a noise when I pulled the tab out of it, like the other two I have, and although it can see it, i only get as far as the air and then it says 'We lost contact with Sammy'. What should I do? Thanks Bleepssss. Yes i got the email! No changes needed. Looking forward to use this. Ill promote it for you guys. Your representative from the Netherlands, regards, Michael When will the app be available in the German Appstore? I cant find the app in the dutch app store! Nice!!! App is on app store Fingers crossed that your comment of "we hope to get approval any day now" is correct and the next update is NOT "Apple want us to make some minor modifications to the App" With a projected ship date of seven months you have now almost doubled that. Really disappointing that this still has not yet shipped. I get that Kickstarter is not a store, but well over a year after funding makes me really question the integrity of the creators. The app design couldn't have been sent to apple in the last 14 months of waiting? Really hoping that the next update says shipped, not another excuse and delay. Were surveys sent for this? I never filled one out, and when I look at 'Surveys' under the 'Backed Projects' page, I see this: "The survey for this reward hasn't been sent by BleepBleeps yet." I can't imagine that you already delayed for over 6 months and now it's even more due approval from Apple. I don't have any background in projects but i would expect working on software in line with hardware. In addition you post this same picture of the warehouse where you holding your products on 12th November. Then are they ready or excuse with ITunes is cover story? (<url>"in a few weeks", anything more specific now that a few weeks have passed? Regards. Instagram link not working. Well it has been a year since the project was funded. Any update to when the Sammy's will finally start to ship. Any chance that you will get them out before the end of the month? I'm near to forget I bought this near two years ago. I had time to build a door alarm with arduino that message me if it opens <url>"no news, is good news". I would however like to get a conformation that this still holds true for this great project? @BleepsBleeps I will be moving in Aug. I have updated to my new address though Backerkit. Possible to ship it so that I will only receive after Mid Aug? My new place will not receive anything for me before I move in. Thanks! Looking forward to holding it in my hands... and hearing it scream!!! Please use a postal service like USPS and DHL, UPS or the like. And please declare it as a gift and not as merchandise. Your product is a reward for our pledges. And please attach that declaration/invoice at the outside of the package too. Thank you and good luck with production and distribution. Cu, Robert Looking forward to my award August 2014 - Red is a hot color! Keep up the good work. @BleepBleeps Thanks for the quick response! I'll look forward to the update :D Any updates on production or progress? Thanks! The link you posted for the basestation did nok work :( Congrats!! :D Congrats! Great job! Awesome, thank you! getting close to the stretch goal :D It would be nice if there was a level where for can get one of each of the colours... I am already signed up for the family pack. I agree with Kai.. get some last minute offers in there :P for us $55 backers I thought about rising my pledge for another Sammy Screamer but your 55,-$ offer is only interesting for Early Bird Kickstarters. If I rise my pledge of Twin Sammy Screamer with 55,-$ I will receive three of them for 180,-$. This is more than the Family Unit will cost. You should think about some other offers for your non Early Bird Kickstarters in the last hours if you want to reach the next stretch goal. Best wishes Would you consider making a base station that plugs dirrectly to a power source, that ultimately could connect over all you upcomming projects? And sends it to the phone via wifi?? Backer #1000 Would you post on your site a video with sound that offers us a sample of the sound the Sammy Screamer - Motion Alarm will make? Will we be able to choose from one sound verses another sound. Is the sound loud and disturbing? Or just email me the sample. In order API Pebble Mac/PC (Desktop app) iOS Bridge (Remote iOS device connects to local iOS device) API Raspberry PI Arduino SDK Sorry. I meant iphone App. Thank you 1. App feature: send email when an event occurs. Thank you 1. Pebble 2, IFTTT IFTTT is definitely a must-have Mac/PC, Pebble or IFTTT 1. Arduino 2. SDK 3. IFTTT 4. iOS Bridge I would love Bergcloud integration. 1. App feature: send email when an event occurs. I would connect Sammy to a spare iOS device at home. My main device, my phone, could receive the email notifications of motion events while I'm at work. This small feature would make Sammy long range. 2. IFTTT Hi, support for IFTTT would be really useful. Thanks Ability for Sammy to 'talk' to Arduino/Raspberry Pi that have BLE add-ons would be very good. IFTTT, Pebble &/or Mac would be great. Great to see a post about support for other services/platforms. The platform I'd like to suggest is node-red (<url>"unused" old smartphone. This smartphone is always within Sammy's range and will receive the initial alert, but then relays the message to me via email. I see it says you can adjust the volume on the app. Does that mean it can turn the volume down on the screamer or is it referring to the phone volume. Please please consider a simple "low tech"version of Sammy for those of us who don't have "smart devices" or would find it inconvenient to have to have a compatible app device to operate Sammy. There is a HUGE unmet need among caregivers of persons with Alzheimers and other forms of demential for a friendly device that alerts them if a patient or loved one has wandered out of their room or the building… particularly in the middle of the night… sometimes getting lost just trying to find the bathroom. While there are battery operated LED motion detector lights on the market, they don't give an audible alarm if someone has gotten out of bed. There are security door alarms - but they are extremely loud and may scare the beejeeezies out of an elder who is just trying to find the bathroom. The gentle bleep bleep of Sammy is so much more "friendly". Perhaps Sammy can have a companion "monitor" (like a baby monitor) so he can be heard by a caregiver in another room in the house or building. Perhaps Sammy can also have a companion LED motion sensitive light so the person can see there way without tripping at night (falling/tripping is one of the major safety hazards for elder Alzheimers/dementia patients!). But please - simple tech. Perhaps there can be different iterations of Sammy -- Sammy Jr/Sr or Sammy 1, 2, 3… at various price points? Is it possible to produce a Simple Sammy ASAP? Thank you for the opportunity to comment & provide input. Interesting point about the server app. Perhaps it comes down to offering a bleepbleeps API with some examples (arduino/sparkcore/raspberrypi/...) of how to create your own 'server' for pushing bleepbleeps data to addressable external services (Xively/bergcloud/opensense/..) WiFi is ok, but how could the bridge talk with the smartphone. This would need to configure a fixed ip in the bridge and add this ip to the smartphone app and this is not as easy as connecting sammy through bluetooth. There are only two techniques available to make it easy enough: a) Like Eye-Fi Card the bridge generates its own WiFi. This WiFi is only available if an alarm needs to be send (so the smartphone is only offline for a short period). This solution is very nice in theory, but as I'm having several Eye-Fi cards I know that the smartphone does not choose the new WiFi in any case. There would be a solution by scanning the wifi signals constantly, but this costs battery lifetime. b) Every Sammy has an ID and sends alarms to a gateway server hosted by BleepBleeps. The smartphone app checks constantly for new alarms at this gateway with this ID. This works without hassles, but costs money and maintenance time at BleepBleeps. I would prefer option B. But instead of creating a new hardware it would be better to create a "server app". This means a smartphone or tablet needs to be connected through bluetooth with sammy and forwards this information in a much more flexible way. e.g. by: 1.) Wifi/3G to the BleepBleeps gateway 2.) Wifi/3G to a cloud service (WebDAV, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) 2.) SMS 3.) email 4.) ??? As it is not expensive to buy a used android or rather most of the people have multiple devices this would be the easiest method. Hope you like it. Do like the idea of a BLE/Wifi bridge, I'm imagining it as a charging pad for the whole bleepbleeps family I agree with Christopher re a basic BLE/WiFi bridge add-on and was thinking along similar lines myself. Here's a suggestion. How about an add on device as a stretch which bridges from bluetooth to wifi. So you don't have to to change the core unit to handle wifi and the extra power requirements and could have a plug in device that Sammy talks to which then does the wifi alerting? Not sure if this is technically feasible but I guess you guys are the experts ... +1 wifi please. Alternate workaround. To send an email from app directly automatically when triggered +1 wifi pleaseeeeeee +1 on WiFi connectivity. Proposal: $100k target: built-in battery with usb charging. I hate coin batteries ;) Nice news on reaching 55K! Regarding additional stretch goals, if Sammy would be connectable to existing gateways (bergcloud for example) - I think it could be a real plus. Question will be how achievable that is within the existing footprint. Another, perhaps more accessible, stretch goal is the inclusion of additional attachment materials. (Add some Sugru+magnets, velcro or removable cable ties...) I like the red the most. Would be great to have a silver one, to match the colour of my car, which is where my Sammy would leave, to alert me if it ever gets stolen. Got my vote for wifi. This will be a great security device for hotel stays. Just in regard to the comments below, I 100% sure that I'll at least double my pledge for wifi functionality if there's going to be one. If you could further develop Sammy Screamer into wifi connectivity that will win over all security devices in the market. If we could use our phone to help setup internal wifi settings and by sending Push to phone, that will be way more better. I'm thinking that 50 meters are actually how far I could see. If this could make me know if my kids open the cupboards for games while I at work that would be fairly more useful than 50 meters. I understand wifi technology is battery drainer but this could be the future. Just to think about it if there's any chances we could get near that point. Love your product design by the way~ can't wait to get one. Very clever. I can think of a million places I could put these. I recognize the concern from other people, if it is only bluetooth, could it keep a notification in some sort of internal memory until your smart phone reconnects? Or WiFi…that would be ideal. Either way, I'm super excited to see this product. This is a very cute idea; I love it! I would like to know if it is waterproof and/or shockproof? Thanks! Can you tell us how loud Sammy can scream? Decibels? Comparison to something? A full volume video with no background music (and a warning message if necessary)? Blue or green! blue Can we have a stretch target for a wifi version? Or a web version, so connects via wifi to router and sends an alert to a web site which tracks or alerts? I'm sure people would increase pledges to get a wifi version if available. Black please! "If your phone goes out of range Sammy goes into standby automatically and the app lets you know." 1.) Scenario: For several seconds the smartphone looses connection to Sammy and exactly in this moment a motion alarm fires. What happens now? Was Sammy in standby or was he able to catch the motion because of a timeout? If yes, how long is it and am I able to change it through the app? 2.) How do I wake up Sammy if he is in standby? "You can override this in the app’s settings and keep Sammy armed when out of range but this is not recommended to protect battery life." 3.) Referring to the 1.) scenario: What happens here? Will the alarm delivered once the connection is established again? What if the next connection takes e.g. 20 minutes? Neutrals: black, gray and white Green and Blue!! Yellow please Green please GREAT JOB! I think the BEST colors would be Red and Yellow. Continued success. Hopefully, you will offer Sammies to your supporters at the end of the campaign. We've just passed the first stretch goal, congrats! Any thoughts on more stretch goals? Maybe a KS limited edition color? Very much looking forward to this product! Sammy, thanks so much for the answers in the faqs. I'm really looking forward to having you to protect us, you luscious little thing. Thank you for adding the target amount of the android app. I'm sure you will reach this target. I've raised my pledge to the family package ;) I think this Sammy screamer is a good idea, the design of a portable motion alarm that can alert you by phone is genius. but there a few things that need to be answer in order for this project to be fully realize (for example the app compatibility and the Bluetooth range), but right now I support this project. Worried regarding the bluetooth range - any chance of including WiFi aswell? WiFi direct e.t.c.? Awesome. Launch it now! (Father of a 6 week-old boy) First target is 20.000? This is confusing as in the details targets list ist only question mark. So nobody knows how much is needed to reach this target. Android please. And I am concerned with the volume of the beep sound. Please make it louder. No android, no pledge. I don't want to buy it today and wait 2 years until I'm able to use it. You should announce a release date. With my newborn son planning to create havoc around the house, I can't wait to test a Sammy Screamer out! Fingers crossed you guys smash you goal as the other BleepBleeps looks awesome too! Sammy would be classy in petroleum blue. But I quite like the available orange as well! Is the Bluetooth range 30 or 50 metres? BleepBleeps are awesome! Can't wait to get my hands on Sammy and the rest of the family. Good luck guys! Wow! I understand that Sammy is a product in its infancy, however I wonder if you could speak to battery type, ability to replace the battery, and I was going to ask about projected times for the battery's useful life, however I recognise that this would be dependent on a number of factors. This seems like a really neat product. Thanks!
