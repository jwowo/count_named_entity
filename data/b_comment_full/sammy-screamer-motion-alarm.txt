Tom &amp; the BleepBleeps team We are just about to push the button on something BIG! We've been very quiet recently. We've been busy... Over the past year we've brought together the UK’s biggest parenting community , a Professor from the Nuffield Department of Clinical Neuroscience at the University of Oxford , a legendary electronic music producer , and Creative Review 's Agency Of The Year to create something truly special. Stay tuned - we'll be back in the next few days with more info... Sleep tight ;) Tom and Team BleepBleeps Thanks for all your feedback! We really enjoyed reading all your responses and finding out all the weird and wonderful ways you guys are using Sammy to keep an eye on your stuff. We read every single one of your surveys and really appreciate your comments. There is an overwhelming demand from everyone to extend Sammy’s range. You have spoken and we listened! So today we are announcing… BleepBleeps Cloud BleepBleeps Cloud will be the platform that connects and controls all our little guys! BleepBleeps Cloud will give our customers worldwide remote control and global alerts from their Sammy Screamers AND also manage all future BleepBleeps products :) Introducing Sammy Screamer - Cloud Edition. Global remote control and worldwide alerts. BleepBleeps Cloud will allow our customers to extend the range of Sammy Screamer by using a second mobile device as a bridge. Keep another iPhone or iPad within range of Sammy (e.g. at home) and receive notifications on your primary iPhone anywhere in the world. We're working on it! BleepBleeps Cloud will be a subscription service, requiring customers to register and pay a small monthly fee. We'd love your feedback and we're looking for beta users - sign up here: <email> . (Don’t forget to let us know your OS.) So who won the Apple Watch? Last month we ran a little competition to get your feedback. We had so many survey responses it was difficult to choose a winner. But there was one Sammy super-user that really stood out… Maria is blind with a young boy. She explained to us how Sammy has really become part of the family in her household and daily life. Maria uses Sammy to keep an eye on her stuff like everybody else but what really intrigued us was how Maria uses Sammy’s “bleep" function to locate her things and her toddler too: "I just absolutely love her. I am blind and use her to locate my purse at home. When I go out she goes to my toddler. He feels so privileged to babysit. Shhh... it's a secret. He doesn't know Sammy's job is to let me know of his whereabouts (close vicinity of course.) Before Sammy: If I wanted to know he was close by and called out for him... Well, he'd figure it was a great opportunity to play hide and seek or catch me if you can. Luckily for me I always travel with a sighted counterpart to take over the wild goose chase. I don't rely on Sammy to keep my baby from getting lost but to keep from asking my partner, "Where is he?" every five minutes. Since Sammy: I command her to bleep and magically he comes running to me, "Sammy crying!" Gotcha!!!" Maria also complimented us on the accessible design of the BleepBleeps app: "It is super friendly with Voice Over. I don't know if by design or by chance, but it just works!" We made parenting easier for Maria! "Sammy has been invaluable in my ordinary day-to-day activities. And I use invaluable and ordinary in the same sentence because what may seem simple and ordinary to the sighted can prove to be tedious and quite a challenge for a blind individual. but when Sammy bleeps to say, "Here is your purse." or "Relax, here's your baby just a few steps away." -- Now that is priceless." So one Apple Watch is on its way to Maria right now. We’re not sure how accessible the Apple Watch is for blind people but I'm sure Maria will have fun finding out! Thanks again to all those who took the time to give us feedback and enter the competition :) Much love, Tom and Team BleepBleeps Sammy on tour: London, Paris and New York. We have some lovely retail partners in some great cities: MoMA Design Store NYC , Design Museum Shop London and Colette Paris . If you'd like to see Sammy in a cool store near you let us know: <email> Android Lollipop Version now available! Bluetooth behaves differently on Android version 5.0 than it does on 4.0 and we've been working on fixing these issues. We finished today! The new BleepsBleeps Android app has just been released and is available to download from Google Play . Thanks for your patience :) Cheers for now... T&amp;TBB Dear Android 5.x peeps, We are working on a Lollipop version right now! We've actually already made a Lollipop version and were hoping to launch with it but Android have changed the way Bluetooth works on version 5.x and it affected the way we connect to Sammy. So we had to launch with the Android 4.x BleepBleeps app But it looks like a lot of our backers (being early adopter types!) have the very latest gear and are lollipopped up! We are hoping to have an updated Android BleepBleeps app compatible with v5.x around the end of May. Thanks for your patience! Tom and the Android BleepBleeps Team (p.s - if you use an iPhone, file this update under irrelevant gobbledigook!) So nice to see Sammy arriving in people's homes - looks like she is already part of the family :) Follow all the latest Bleepiness on Instagram And... We are working on an Android Lollipop version! We currently don't support Android version 5.0+ yet. Bluetooth behaves differently on version 5.0 than it does on 4.0 and we are working on fixing the issues right now. We hope to release a new version of the BleepBleeps Android app that is compatible with 5.0+ in late May. Keep Bleepin' T+TBB All orders despatched! Sammy is making her way to you on a planes, trains and automobiles :) ETA: UK 2-3 days US 3-5 days ROW 5-7 days And we've been working on app version 1.0.1 - live on the App Store now... Can't wait for you all to meet Sammy! Much love T&amp;TBB We had approval from Apple today and are ready to ship! Shortly you will receive the "48 hours to go" email from Backerkit asking you to confirm your address. Please check we have the right address for you on the system. If not, it's simple to change on Backerkit or just email us or message us on Kickstarter and we will do it for you :) Here we go! Thanks so much for your continued patience and support - it means the world to us... T&amp;TBB All of your Sammy Screamers are sitting patiently in our fulfillment partner's warehouse in the UK... As soon as we get iTunes approval from Apple we can push the button on shipping. We hope this will be late next week! Here's a little sneak preview of the app in action: Looking forward to landing Sammy on your doorstep! T&amp;TBBx Here we go! Just a quick update to let you all know we have finished testing Over The Air Updates and are now waiting on Apple to approve the BleepBleeps iPhone app. They have Sammy in California and we are waiting in line for... iTunes approval Rumour has it Apple are quite busy with their Watch. I'm sure they'll get to us soon. Thank you all for your continued support and patience :) Not long now! T&amp;TBB ps. did you see us at the Design Museum? We are chuffed to be there! Don't forget to get all our latest updates on Instagram . Don't forget to get all our latest updates on Instagram . Just a quickie to let you all know where we are... ☑ 28,000 components ordered and delivered ☑ Printed circuit boards assembled ☑ Product packaging arrived ☑ UPC-A barcode number allocated ☑ 10,000 magnets manufactured ☑ Product Labels printed ☑ Battery Pull Tab created ☑ 7,500 plastic case mouldings here ☑ Fulfilment packaging finalised ☑ Firmware complete ☑ Product assembled ☑ iOS tested and bugs fixed ☑ Android tested and bugs fixed ☑ Submitted hardware to Apple ☑ Over The Air updates implemented ☒ Over The Air updates tested (this week) ☒ Final firmware loaded (next week) ☒ Apple iTunes approval (we're waiting on them) ☒ Sammy starts shipping (beginning of March) Over The Air updates We want Sammy to have a long life. So it's important for us to be able to update her software remotely. That means as we continue to improve her functionality you can update her using the BleepBleeps app. This is not something we promised in the Kickstarter campaign but we believe its better to make Sammy as future-proof as possible and have been working extra hard to make it happen. It's not simple! And it turns out this particular aspect of the Bluetooth component we're using isn't very well documented. Plus we've had some extra stress as this particular Bluetooth component manufacturer was acquired very recently and dropped off the radar in terms of support for their products leaving us high and dry for a few weeks. It's all sorted now. But it's put us back a couple of weeks. Made with love in the UK Proud to be flying the flag for British manufacturing :) Apple iTunes Approval We've sent Sammy to Apple HQ in California so they can approve the BleepBleeps app to release on to iTunes so all you lovely iPhone users can download it easily. We are now in their hands... (All you lovely Android users will be able to download the BleepBleeps app from Google Play as soon as Sammy ships as there is no approval process.) That's all for now! Tom and TBB :) Dear BBbackers, This will be one of our last updates :) :( Sammy is all ready for production! Check out this video on Instagram... ☑ 28,000 components ordered and delivered ☑ Printed circuit boards assembled ☑ Product packaging arrived ☑ UPC-A barcode number allocated ☒ 10,000 magnets manufactured (Friday) ☒ Product Labels (Friday) ☒ Battery Pull Tab (Friday) ☒ 7,500 plastic case mouldings arrive (Monday) ☒ Fulfilment packaging finalised (Monday) ☒ Firmware complete (Monday) ☒ First batch pre-release product assembly (Monday) ☒ iOS tested and bugs fixed (9 Feb) ☒ Android tested and bugs fixed (9 Feb) ☒ First batch pre-release ships (12 Feb) ☒ Over The Air updates tested (16 Feb) ☒ Second batch product assembly (16 Feb) ☒ Apple iTunes approval (21 Feb) ☒ Sammy starts shipping (end of Feb) So very nearly very nearly there! We've delayed our production a tiny wee bit more as we wanted to add something really special to Sammy… Over The Air updates This means that we can continue to improve Sammy and add functionality in the future. So rather than having a product that stays the same as you receive it on day one, you'll get a product that can be improved and updated as we go. We can ask you guys what you'd like (within reason!) then build it and then you can update Sammy’s software using the BleepBleeps app. We feel this extra magic is worth waiting for and we’ve always wanted Sammy to be as useful as possible. This is a great way to extend her usefulness and ultimately her product life, bless her. Apple iTunes approval Unlike Android apps on the Google Play store Apple actually vet and approve every single app on iTunes. This is slightly more complex for app enabled hardware as we have to send Sammy to Apple so they can approve the BleepBleeps app before they make it available to you for download on iTunes. The approval process for a standard app takes a week and so we have allowed 2 to 3 weeks for this approval process because of the extra complexity. So by the time we begin to ship Sammy at the end of February Apple will have made the app available on iTunes. We hope. Can’t wait till end of February? Quite techy? Pre-release Sammy Screamers for pioneers available in a few weeks... If you simply cannot wait for Over The Air (OTA) updates and iTunes approval we have a first batch of pre-release Sammys available. This product will have finalised hardware with firmware version 1.0. Because this version will not have OTA updates you will not be able to update this firmware and benefit from all the additional functionality, improvements and support we will provide to our customers without sending your Sammy back to BleepBleeps HQ in London. And if you are an iOS user you will have to register with TestFlight to install a beta version of the BleepBleeps app until it is approved by Apple and available on iTunes. If this sounds exciting to you email <email> and we will send you your Sammy in the next few weeks. Stay right up to the minute with BleepBleeps on Instagram As usual, we'll be sharing our progress on Instagram , Facebook and Twitter as we start to ship Sammy. Plus we have some very exciting news to share about our next products and crowd funding campaigns we want to share with you! Here's a sneak peak of Suzy and Basil - can you guess what they are? We'll be back very shortly with more Sammy updates - thanks to every single one of you for your continued patience and support - we genuinely appreciate it. We can't wait to get Sammy to you! Tom and Team BleepBleeps. Dearest BleepBleeps backers, We're very nearly there! This week we received the first production samples of Sammy's injection molded plastic cases from our manufacturer in Shenzhen in China. The cases look great but we have a few snags to work through (which is entirely normal at this stage) and we'll be working over Christmas to get the final cases produced and shipped to the UK for assembly in January. Sammy's guts (the electrical engineering, printed circuit board and components) have been finalised and ordered ready for assembly in the UK over the coming weeks. We're just finishing off the firmware (the software on Sammy that makes her work) and we'll be ready to assemble the final electronics into the plastic cases in time to start shipping in January. Final certification and testing has been booked at one of the world's leading test houses. They will zap, smash and set fire to Sammy to make sure she is 100% safe for you and your kids. Lanyards (in three contrasting colours) have arrived ready to be attached to Sammy to help you hang her on your stuff. Packaging is ready to rock... App is looking good (on Android and iOS) <url>’s battery cover to include an additional screw fixing. We didn't have to change the design - but we wanted to make Sammy the safest she could possibly be. We could have pushed Sammy through a different (less stringent) certification category without changing the design and kept to our November ship date. But we didn’t. We want Sammy to be the safest she can possibly be. And we wanted to pass the most stringent and contemporary safety category available. So (despite being in production) we’ve changed the design - which has been expensive for us and meant we’ve had to work around the clock to get the new design sorted. Shipping in January This design change means we’ve had to push the ship date back from November to January. We hope you agree with our decision to prioritise safety and quality over speed and profit. And just maybe, we can surprise some of you with a Sammy in time for Christmas :) we’ll do our best! Other bits and bobs... Look out for Sammy in Colette (Paris) and the Design Museum Shop (London). A warm welcome to our new stockists… get in touch if you’d like to see Sammy in a store near you: <email> DesignJunction We had a great time at The London Design Festival . Thanks to all those who swang by our stand at DesignJunction to say hello! App coming on nicely... That's all for now - see you back here for our November update :) Cheers T&amp;TBB Dearest nearest, Come and see us during The London Design Festival! We'll be exhibiting at Designjunction 18-21 September at The Sorting Office 21-31 New Oxford Street "Designjunction showcases the very best in furniture, lighting and product design from around the world, presenting world-class brands against stunning industrial backdrops of a centrally-located 1960s Sorting Office. The show presents a powerful line-up of renowned international brands, smaller cutting-edge labels, pop-up shops, large-scale installations, eateries, flash factories, seminars and screenings across three floors of the impressive 120,000 sq ft venue." Come see us on stand G24! Sammy ship date We're still on target to ship Sammy in Q4! Our latest challenge has been around volume of the device. We've been working really hard to balance Sammy's loudness without affecting the battery life too much. We've had to tweak our PCB design to add in a driver to squeeze the most juice out of our current set-up. That's all done now and we're glad we've prioritised battery life over loudness - we think it's better for you guys. Our best estimate for shipping is late November - we can't wait to get one to you! We're on the map with Wired Magazine Lovely to be featured in Wired Magazine's map of London Hardware companies - can you spot Olivia P. Sticks? Thanks for your continued support! We'll be back in October with our monthly update, byeeeeeeeee x Team BB Hello dear BleepBleeps backers, We have lots of things to update you on... Firstly: Free gift boxes for everyone! We've been working really hard on the presentation pack for Sammy and we’re so happy with we’ve decided to include one with each and every Sammy we ship. It’s a very clever cardboard engineering design, cut from a single piece of cardboard. It holds Sammy nice and central so you can see her the moment you open the box. A little welcome message with download instructions on the reverse of the lid. There’s a little hole top left for the mini-lanyard to poke through and... there’s a really cute little BleepBleeps icon when you take Sammy out :) Sammy ship date... Q4 :| We've had a few challenges to work through with one of the components we’re using inside Sammy. We built the Sammy prototype using a particular Bluetooth component on a development board so we could write the code to make Sammy work. Now we have that component in the final production-ready PCB (printed circuit board) we've had real trouble getting our code onto that particular component. It turns out we're not alone and lots of people have been having a similar problem with that particular component (mentioning no names!) and the manufacturers have been working through these problems with many developers around the world. We've solved the problem now but it’s taken us a long time and has had an impact on the production of the rest of Sammy. We're really disappointed but we're having to push back the delivery date of Sammy. We're not quite sure of the full impact yet but our estimate is a couple months. We're really sorry about this and we're doing everything we can to accelerate delivery. We'll be back with more updates soon and hope to ship Sammy in Q4. We can't wait to get one to you! ßayter/ßeeter The BleepBleeps Beta group is still open. This strictly limited group will get free early access to Sammy (and other devices soon) and the BleepBleeps app on iOS and Android. If you want to be a part of the family email us on <email> and let us know your name, address, phone and OS. The BleepBleeps Family We just had to share this with you!

The interior is white felt with a debossed logo and the devices are held in place by layers of felt in the BleepBleeps colours. The base colour underneath each device matches the device colour! Super-awesome. We get around… We’ve been spreading the BleepBleeps word all over the planet from Denmark to San Francisco . Tom has been speaking at various design festivals , conferences , briefings and even had breakfast at No10! We've also been regular faces in the emerging London Hardware scene with meetups like Hardware Startup Lab , London Hardware Collective and IoT London .

Let's do this! Thank you so much to all our backers for making BleepBleeps a reality! T &amp; TBB x 2 BIG things Lots of you have been asking about extending Sammy’s range through WiFi or connecting to a home hub of some sort. And lots of you have been asking about extending Sammy’s capability by integrating with third party services. We love these ideas. And today we want to share with you our plans for the future. First of all… We are dedicated to openness and integration. We want Sammy (and all BleepBleeps products) to integrate with as many other systems, protocols and services as possible. Imagine setting Sammy up so that if she gets moved the lights in your living room change colour. Or a certain song plays on your home music system. Or your garage door opens. We love the potential of these ideas, but there are so many services, devices and platforms to choose from. We need your help to decide which ones we prioritise! IFTTT Wigwag Pebble Windows Phone Mac/PC (Desktop app) iOS Bridge (Remote iOS device connects to local iOS device) API Raspberry PI Arduino SDK The integration of each of these options takes time. We will release significant updates to the app post launch that contain extra features. Let us know which which features you'd like us to prioritise. And if there is a product or service you'd like Sammy to integrate with please let us know! Sammy Screamer 2.0 [WiFi Experimental] We want to make a WiFi version of Sammy Screamer. Right now, this is hard. Power consumption and battery life are a big issues. We are working with the latest components as they come to market and we will engineer a second version of Sammy Screamer as soon as it is technically possible. We're offering the opportunity to our most dedicated backers to join us on that journey. If you're brave enough, pledge at $150 to join the Beta Group and you will receive the first prototype of Sammy 2.0 as soon as physically possible. Here we are on stage announcing Sammy 2.0 at Launch Festival in San Francisco last week: More tweets and pics here . And btw did you see the video Mashable made about us?! Thanks so much for the love and support JUST 4 DAYS TO GO!

We unlocked the first Stretch Goal at $30,000 for the Android App. We would love love love to make the iOS app Universal . You know, so it resizes nicely on an iPad instead of that tiny iPhone size version in the middle of the screen, or a big X2 scaled up version? That's our next Stretch Goal at $40,000 - keep 'em coming! Much love x Tom, Sammy and the Bleeps We've made a great start by smashing our goal in the first day! If we keep growing we'll unlock some great features and products . Plus some cool secret stuff planned! First up is Android App at $30,000: Thanks everybody... Let's do this! Tom and Team BleepBleeps x We did it! We hit our target in just one day! We are all over the moon here :) Especially Sammy. Thanks to all those backers and sharers - you made it happen and we are eternally grateful. More updates and stretch targets coming very soon... The good ship BleepBleeps has set sail. Oh wow oh wow Tom and Team BleepBleeps x p.s. we made onto Techcrunch and got retweeted by the Duke of York - what a day :) Wow! 4 hours in - and all of our SAMMY SCREAMER early birds have gone! From all at team BleepBleeps: a massive bleepy thank you to all of our backers! So what next? How about a new early bird price? Check it out: $60 for the next 250! Much love x Team BleepBleeps :)
