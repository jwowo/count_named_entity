I'll have some new info regarding Shining Empire very soon - and we're going to have a couple of those features that we were unable to overfund for. Also, something really remarkable. I'm going forward with the dungeon crawler, but the way this game is being developed is unlike anything that's ever been done. We're still ironing out the details but we're hoping to have some kind of trailer in just a couple of weeks. I don't want to say too much about it, but I am producing the title and it's being developed by an old friend of mine. I'll make sure the story is consistent with Shining Empire, but he's in control. The reasons why this is remarkable will be revealed very soon, but it's being developed by someone in a very unique situation. Also, by having him develop it this allows me to keep giving 100% to Shining Empire. I've helped him get the ball rolling the last couple of weeks and what he's already come up with is very unique and even has me excited to see where he takes it. This is just a tease right now, but more info soon! This is - as of now, just an idea. I'm looking for feedback on this idea. Shining Empire is a massive RPG. When you begin - you begin with nothing. BUT...I had a thought. The story of Shining Empire (I will truncate it) is that your uncle lay dying in bed, stabbed several times, and leaves you all his land. It's up to you to discover the truth. However, I thought - what if there was a prelude game which allows you to play as the uncle and build up some wealth which can be carried over into Shining Empire? Something similar was done with Fable 2 on the Xbox 360 (with the Pub Games), but this would be a LOT different. The game would be a classic dungeon crawler - similar to Gateway to Apshai, Zelda, or Toe Jam and Earl (believe it or not, that was actually a dungeon crawler too!). You would play as the uncle and fight through levels of a VERY difficult dungeon. if you survive, the wealth you accumulated will be carried over into Shining Empire (later this year). The gameplay would be very different from Shining Empire. It wouldn't be a minigame, but it also wouldn't really be a full featured game either. It would also give some clues as to what happened to your uncle. It wouldn't allow you to become so rich that Shining Empire was very easy from the outset. It would give you a bit of treasure to start off with but what it would really give you are some special unlockables from the start to build some things you'd normally have to level up for. This game would be free to every Kickstarter contributor and would probably be $5 to those that did not contribute. Your main question might be "Wouldn't this slow down Shining Empire development?" The answer is: Yes and no. A lot of the graphics/animation/sounds that would be created for this game would also be used for Shining Empire. It's a way to continue to work on Shining Empire but to also give out something extra and free sooner than the full game. I believe it's an opportunity to expand Shining Empire quickly and get some more attention for it. But I want to know what YOU think! Post in the comments or send me a private message. Thanks for all your support! We are now funded and ready to go! I'm beyond excited about finishing up this game. We didn't reach all of our goals, but we may run another Kickstarter in a few months to try to reach them. Ultimately, once the beta starts I feel that word of mouth will start to take over and we'll get more publicity. That would be a good time to run another kickstarter. However, note that regardless - this game WILL be finished. The only reason for a second kickstarter would be to reach those other goals. The rewards would be the same as before, so there would be no reason for any of you to re-up your pledge. You're good to go! But speaking of re-upping your pledges, I do have a very cool announcement. For those wanting to get in on the kickstarter or up their pledge to higher levels, you can do so without spending any real money. Here's a secret: In 2016 Arcade County is opening a studio and will be hosting 3x a week a retro gaming show. This show will be comprised of Retro Gamer Society members and will have a very unique twist: Audience participation. On the show we'll be playing classic games and the audience can gamble (using a virtual currency) on how far we will (or will not) get. As you earn coins you'll be able to purchase real world items such as brand new games. It's all virtual currency, NO real money is ever used, but the prizes are real! Now, in order to build up our studio we're on the hunt for retro games. We've already collected 500+ titles and we'll be putting out a video shortly showing off the collection and explaining what we're doing. So to up your pledge, we want your old games! Check how much your games are worth at pricecharting.com then mail them to us and let us know your email address and what level pledge you want to be moved up to. We'll also add the cost it was to ship the games towards your pledge. Now there are a few conditions. We don't want loose discs (all disc-based games must come in the original case) and we don't want sports games unless they're 'legendary' titles such as: Baseball Stars, Mutant League Football, Ice Hockey, etc. We mostly want platformers and shooters. Anything that would work great for betting how far someone can get in a game. If you've got anything you'd like to send over to up your pledge, shoot me an email at <email> and let me know what you've got and I'll let you know how much those games can up your pledge by. Also, we are on the hunt for consoles as well, but make sure these are games and systems you no longer play. I'd hate to deprive someone of great gaming! As for Shining Empire, stay tuned! The beta is going to come MUCH sooner than you think! We're less than a week out from the Kickstarter completing, but even once it does there's going to be some cool new info immediately following. So why not post it on the Kickstarter to get more contributions? A couple of reasons. One of them is that I feel like the Kickstarter shows enough to get people to make up their minds no whether or not they should contribute. We've got 100 contributors and that's more than enough testers. I'm contempt with what we have. More contributions would be great, but with what we have now - the game is going to be great. We won't hit all our goals obviously, but once the game is released I would like to add all of those features. It would be nice to have them at launch, but the reality is that few websites talked about Shining Empire, so we didn't get a lot of traffic. I hope to make them regret that when people are playing the game and they're sitting there wondering where their review copies are (hint: they ain't coming!). A few sites were great to me, and they will definitely be hooked up, but these sites that thought it was more important to post about a new Shaq-Fu game Kickstarter (sequel to one of the biggest jokes in gaming history) than Shining Empire will get nothing. Thanks to everyone that has contributed. We reached our goal in less than 72 hours and we're well on our way to dwarfing the other 2 unsuccessful kickstarter campaigns. Once the media gets into gear on Monday we're hoping for even more contributions. So now it's time to start talking about stretch goals. I'll try to finalize the list later tonight, but suggestions are more than welcome. Right now here is the tentative list: $12,000 - full online co-op $9,500 - Online factions (join a faction and help other players online) $8,000 - Empire Anvil Level 2 (share your creations online) $7,000 - Empire Anvil Level 1 (create your own games using the S.E. engine) $5,500 - Social site where you can compare stats and share screen shots $4,500 - Achievements and online leaderboards (time played, city value, % completed etc) $3,500 - Air and sea combat (with upgradable weapons/armor) $2,500 - Boats and airships for faster travel over land/sea
