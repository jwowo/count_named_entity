Still nothing. Three years since the promised delivery date. I accepted delivery after Christmas. I guess I should have gotten a new promised delivery date. Still waiting... Still nothing OCTOBER 4TH AND STILL NO CONTACT OR ITEM. I've just left a comment on one of his posts on his Facebook page (Jason van Buren). Maybe his friends will notice if many of us start asking this way about where our kickstarter rewards are. Also, this is definitely his page. It has the same photo as his kickstarter profile. Jared - good point. I am not sure how to delete a post. Jason is from LA - went to UCLA according to his website and this is an LA address. Still - if you know how to delete a post please let me know. @Cheryl this is a bit touchy and not sure that I would add this personal information. What if it was not the same person? now 150 would be harassing someone who was not involved. I am not defending him or his actions but this is not the right thing to do JUST because we do not have accurate information. This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. Nice way for Jason Van Buren to make a quick $5,047. Hope he sleeps well at night knowing he ripped everyone off! @Kelly Totally agree. I think though we should keep this thread up.. we could turn this into a support group Jason Van Buren is probably hoping that people have forgotten about this by now. I hope he enjoyed spending our money. At least his name will be associated with this whenever someone googles him. @Erin.. basically. this is the chance we take when we support someone in kickstarter So, what? This guys just taking our money then? I love the fact that this guy last logged in on May 14th... Never got anything, but reading from the backers who got what they paid for, I guess I am glad I didn't go through the pain of not seeing anything grow. Kickstater needs to have a ranking system where we can give a creator 1 star for a job poorly done. Fool me once.. I was one of the "lucky" ones and actually got what I ordered in late January. I followed the directions on the package, and nothing has ever germinated. My outlay was small and I am not concerned, but this guy needs to step up and right what he wronged, especially to the people who never got what they ordered. I don't know how he sleeps at night knowing that he ripped folks off. I reached out to Kickstarter as well. And got a generic response about how they would try to contact the creator. If there is anyone here who lives in California, and paid for one of the more expensive packages, you can try filing a claim in small claims court. The filing fee for claims less than $1500 is $30. Maybe if Jason van Buren realizes he can be held legally accountable for stealing other peoples money, he may refund it or actually provide the product that was paid for. The section is penal code 484-502.9 "(a) Every person who shall feloniously steal, take, carry, lead, or drive away the personal property of another, or who shall fraudulently appropriate property which has been entrusted to him or her, or who shall knowingly and designedly, by any false or fraudulent representation or pretense, defraud any other person of money, labor or real or personal property, or who causes or procures others to report falsely of his or her wealth or mercantile character and by thus imposing upon any person, obtains credit and thereby fraudulently gets or obtains possession of money, or property or obtains the labor or service of another, is guilty of theft." After MANY attempts to contact Jason Van Buren, and two tickets started with the hopes of enlisting the help of Kickstarter Support I have still not received my 4 seedling gift kits or a refund of my $30. I emailed Jason yesterday reminding him of the Golden Rule (RE: "Be respectful and considerate") and CC'd Kickstarter support. Their reply was to use the "Contact Me" button to reach the project creater, which I then informed them on this project is no longer available. They sent back a patronizing email which included a sentence saying they've reached out to this project creator. Below is my final reply to Kickstarter - I would encourage the other backers whose money was taken to also let Kickstarter know how this made YOU feel: "I was excited about Kickstarter, but now the trust is gone. The only financial risk I was informed about and consented to when backing this project was losing my money if the project was not successful. This one was picked out as a Kickstarter Staff Favorite, and WAY exceeded its goal. I never knew that extreme success of a project could also result in me losing my money given in faith and trust. If by "reaching out" you mean that you emailed him, good luck. I would try calling him, over and over. Maybe you could help regain the trust of the backers that got ripped off by Jason VanBuren if you right this wrong. Maybe if I experienced an acceptable outcome I would feel ok backing other projects in the future." To be sure u have correct contact it is <email> I've very politely reached out to Paper Seed and Tree using any contact information I can find, and I have received no response whatsoever. I would rather they be honest and give me an answer I may not want to hear, but the absolute communications blackout is frustrating. Do keep an eye on his next project (mother/father day is coming) and make sure to alert the backers about his way of doing business. Josh - you're assuming others weren't also respectful in their replies. I sent over 10 messages and was very respectful, expressing my understanding for the delay. The issue is he pocketed over $5,000 of other people's money, money people worked hard for, and didn't even have the decency to send a message explaining why all of the packages still haven't been delivered. On January 11 this was the comment that was posted "There are still many backers waiting on their rewards. The bottom line is this: Today is truthfully, the last day of waiting. Everything ships first thing tomorrow -- really." Today is March 18, and there have been no further messages. I don't think anyone is faulting him for the delay, people are faulting him for the lack of communication. Ultimately, if you want to run a successful business you need to be transparent and give people what they ordered. If you don't, it comes across as a scam. Quite frankly, right now he is stealing other peoples money, as he has not provided the product that was paid for. People have been held liable in small claims court for less. I still haven't gotten my package. I have received 1 email back over a month ago saying he printed my shipping label. His email address is <email> You made me do my first and only chargeback on my credit card. That sucks. Josh, it's not the delay that we are concerned about as we all know that delays happen on Kickstarter. It's the lack of communication (and multiple broken shipment date promises) that is causing the frustration. Which in turn, means that many of us doubt whether we'll get our hands on what we pledged for. I received mine. It is what was advertised, had instructions and the easier one worked. Guys he explained what happened, he wasn't expecting to get slammed like that. And you are lucky if this was your first wait through Kickstarter. Calm down. I was respectful in my questions and got a reply. Try it. Michael, I get it, but there is no excuse for no communication I received an email today. I was informed that my shipment went out today. I will keep yall posted. From what I understand, the owner is a young entrepreneur, and bit off more than he could chew. He seems to be actively trying to make good on his promises but it is slow going. As a small business man I understand the challenges and fears of owning a startup. Making mistakes is ok. Late delivery is even ok, after all, we are paying into startups. I hope he digs deep and makes good to his orders. I still have not received my seedlings, nor have I received any communication from the company, despite having sent them a few emails. I still have not received my seedlings, nor have I received any communication from the company, despite having sent them a few emails. I still have not received my seedlings, nor have I received any communication from the company, despite having sent them a few emails. This is the owners name Jason van Buren Paper, Seed & Tree Co. I would like to hear from the cowards who started this project I think it is ridiculous and Kickstarter don't take some responsibility here and help get our money back, this is a scam which they endorsed! .. Not happy! It really is sad. I feel for everyone who did not get what they asked for. I really hope they do not create another kickstarter and try this again. I would probably pledge and just warn everyone if they do this again... This makes me sad :( My 1yr old & 3 yr old cousins never got their Christmas present and I lost all the money I spent :( 4 years and 36 projects later, this is the first time I've been genuinely burned by a KS project. I guess I should be thankful it was only $10 for me. Has anyone reported this to kickstarter? I want my money back! Does this radio silence means they've just taken our money and ran? Still haven't got mine! What's going on? I'm still waiting for my product and an update. At this point I'm not holding my breath. Such a disappointment. @stephen I received mine a few weeks ago... I **** a lot and reported them everyday Has ANYONE here received an update or even their product? I contacted the federal government and they immediately put me through to the president once they heard how serious the issue was. Legislation is going into effect on Monday banning all seedling related kickstarter ideas and putting their creators in prison. We can all rest easier knowing we won't get bamboozled again. Maybe a way to contact: From LinkedIn: Jason van Buren Founder at Paper, Seed & Tree Co. Santa Monica, California Consumer Goods Education University of California, Los Angeles Instragram account: <url>"Kickstarter does not guarantee projects or investigate a creator's ability to complete their project. On Kickstarter, backers (you!) ultimately decide the validity and worthiness of a project by whether they decide to fund it. " I was the 10th backer. No shipping notification, no communication. Multiple messages sent. I am posting here 2 days in advance of my reporting them to Kickstarter. I echo what others have said - I would have been happy and willing to wait if someone would have just communicated with me. How can 164 orders be a challenge? This is a joke. I received my package and it is totally ridiculous. A recycled tennis ball container that is a mess of tissue paper, soil and styrofoam. No instructions. Kickstarter should vet these people before accepting projects. This is an absolute joke. I still haven't received my ten set and the one half ass one they sent me hasn't grown one seedling out of the 10-15 seeds I have tried to plant. I have not gotten a package nor a tracking number, and our private messages since January second have gone unanswered. This is very disappointing. I never got anything. Other than a mail before the end of the year saying theyll ship next day. Sigh. It would be really nice to have an update on when these are going to ship. My little cousins are still waiting for their Christmas present I'm still waiting for an update and my package. Were all of the packages shipped? hi guys - i received my order and they were packaged well. i never got a tracking number or a DM from paper seed, and tree, but the package arrived anyway so there might still be good news for everyone else! I'm the first backer and I haven't heard anything! Still no tracking number here either. backer#39 have recd nothing Package arrived! Was given two bonus kits. They look a little messy but at least they're here. Still no product still no tracking number. What is going on? Paper seed and tree, I believe you when you say you've had a month full of obstacles filling the orders of the backers. I understand technology can be fickle especially around Christmas with UPS and that staffing can be lighter as priorities shift during and after the holidays. I understand the production aspect has hit some snags. I believe you on those. I am starting to doubt that you've "learned a lot" when it comes to how to speak to your customers and backers. You have said repeatedly that you will DM us with tracking numbers and information. The comments here all agree - we want communication. Maybe if you took the time to directly communicate with us, you could ask who needs their seedlings immediately and who would be willing to wait as long as February or March for delivery, and then you could adjust your production accordingly. If you communicated with us, you could reset our expectations on a very specific level, personally, instead of claiming actions you have yet to follow through. I, for one, would appreciate communication over expedited delivery. I can't speak for everyone, but you can speak to them to discover their own needs. Best, breé. I was Backer #22. And I have not heard anything. On Jan 6, 8, and 10th I sent messages with no response. What is going on? I have been trying to change what I put in my purvey since I have purchased Cilantro and Dill somewhere else. I would like 10 - Basil 16 - Oregano Finally got my order. Some of the packages had opened. Was a bit messy. Thank you for following through My tracking number still says pre shipment since the 27th. Also, they sent me a few jumbled mess seed kits before Christmas and none of them will grow anything. Pretty sure seedlings don't take 2+ weeks to sprout, and yes I did plant the seeds. I got mine yesterday, so looks like they're coming. If we haven't received a tracking number, does this mean that we are getting a refund? I haven't received anything either. What is going on here? I still haven't received my tracking number yet? Just curious when I am getting my tracking number? I just hope something comes in the mail this week so I can awkwardly give these belated gifts to my friends and family. thanks for taking the time and effort to get everything out - based on your last comment, does this mean that we will be getting our tracking numbers after all the kits are shipped tomorrow? i never heard from you guys since replying with my seed choices on the 16th so just wanted to make sure that waiting another day or so will definitely mean that the packages get delivered. Thanks again! Is there anybody on here who actually received what they paid for? I have yet to even receive a tracking number for mine From one of apparently many who are still waiting to hear from you. What is happening? You say be end of day you'll send everything out. Then at the end of the day..........nothing. Am I getting these seedlings or did I spend my money on nothing? Please let me know so I can advise others about your company. Would love to save others the disappointment. Order:Lance Hain: Paper, Seed & Tree Seedling Gift Kits.Please send me the following 6 seedlings: 1)Basil * 2)Cilantro * 3)Lavender * 4)Parsley * 5)Rosemary ** 6)Spearmint ** where is my order I'm still waiting on my DM as well... When am I on the list for a dm? Order:Lance Hain: Paper, Seed & Tree Seedling Gift Kits.Please send me the following 6 seedlings: 1)Basil * 2)Cilantro * 3)Lavender * 4)Parsley * 5)Rosemary ** 6)Spearmint ** where is my order Will send a DM as well, but hoping this gets seen. If I cannot get a refund, I NEED my order to be shipped to a different address. The people who were to receive the gift live in a different state, and they have returned home already. Please DM me ASAP! Thanks. It also apparently went beyond the ability to respond to multiple people's messages, comments, which led to disappoint and abhorrent communication which is evidence by multiple complaints to both kickstarter and Amazon. I have nothing to say to you personally that I will not say in comments. I sent multiple messages in private that were not answered and I feel no need to give you the courtesy I was not afforded. Here is the bottom line. You could have set reasonable limits for what could have been accomplished with supply and man hours. You didn't. You over sold what you didn't have. I've lost patience and sympathy. Honestly I just want a refund. I filed a complaint with Amazon payments, but they told me that they can't do anything. So, I'm going to dispute this with my bank now. I filed a complaint with Amazon payments too. I'm going to see if I can dispute the charge with my credit card company as well. This is the worst customer service experience I've ever had. I went ahead and filed a dispute with my credit card company I filed a complaint with Amazon payments. I'm done with this. I doubt there will be any refund considering their total silence, but if you payed them with a credit card, you have the right to call your credit card company and request a charge back. That is what I will be doing after work. I am tired of these kinds of projects. So where are non-rush orders? I'm all for patience, but I've hit my limit. Looks to me like they got overwhelmed and just walked away with our money I made a report to kickstarter as well. I didn't want to but this is ridiculous. I wonder if they had this bad of service the last few times they did Kickstarter campaigns. I'm just really glad I only spent $10. I doubt kickstarter will do anything, they usually say they are just the intermediary. But I don't blame you for the report. This is the worst experience I have had. yeah i sent a report to kickstarter this is insane... Interested in a refund. Doubt that's possible, but I'd rather have $30 toward bills than $30 toward a company that can't bother responding to me or any of us. I am feeling the frustration as well, and a refund would be much desired. The lack of communication has really caused me to reconsider supporting this project. If someone had at least responded directly to me, I would be more understanding, but customer service is extremely lacking. This is getting extremely frustrating. I have sent two messages and I still have not heard back or received a tracking number, despite being told I would receive a tracking number on 12/16. I bought these as Christmas gifts. And Christmas was a week ago. I understand the delay but communication needs to improve. I would consider a refund as well at this point. Still no communication and updates, The project creator has sent me a tracking number but it does not have any info on the package or any updates at all. It's stuck on the date December 23 I am about to that point as well. No communication no updates and no product until...sometime in 2015? Really bummed I never received my product! At this point I'd rather receive a refund as the seeds were all going to be Xmas gifts. Tomorrow is 2015. Laaaaaaame :/ "We start shipping all rewards on December 18, 2014." Will we receive our Christmas kits before you lust your "Valentine's Day Special" Kickstarter campaign? I wish they could AT LEAST give out an update to us customers.. I have a bad feeling @Jeremy - I agree, communication between creator and backers is essential. They definitely need someone to take care of this aspect. Still no product and I was told I would get on the 26th. Is this cause I wasn't willing to pay the 25.00 expedited shipping? Still no direct message, no response to direct messages, and no product. I understand the troubles that have been had, but communication needs to improve vastly The problem with this project is that it became a Kickstarter Staff Pick and the people behind the project were not prepare for it. They got 10 times more people than they were expecting. I know, they promised a Christmas delivery, but with this increase in demand, they got overwhelmed. It is understandable, they are humans, not robots. I think everyone should be patient. It is not like you are going to grow those plants in the middle of winter... Still no dm..... no product either... No product, no tracking info. Still waiting on mine as well.... Thanks Jason. Thanks for making this better and I apologize for being harsh. 3 parsley when I ordered zero parsley. 5 missing seed packets and 4 missing tubes and zero response from this kickstarter. This ranks as one of my worst experiences on here. I only received 6 instead of 10 that I pledged. Awesome. When are we supposed to receive our tracking numbers? Can someone please get back to me? I know you are all busy and it's Xmas, but I have written several DMs with no response. This is a time crunch gifting situation; please see my previous DMs and respond ASAP. Thanks! Still waiting on mine.. I hope we will receiving our seedlings sometime soon? I still haven't received mine, I know that I didn't get my address in on time so Im ok with that. I consider it an extended Christmas! I still have not received a direct message. USPS just dropped off today's packages from Amazon and no seedlings. Very disappointed as I was the 12th backer and ordered 10 for Christmas. Over promised and under delivered. I didnt get any email about choosing mine...and I totally forgot to check! Sooo...what should I do?! Same here Audrey. I just want to know if mine has even shipped yet. No tracking number here, either. � I provided my information before the 18th with no response. It now looks like I won't be getting these before Christmas. Very disappointed as this was Christmas presents for the whole family. Thanks for the update. You guys have been awesome! In the same boat as Jeremy Dixon. Didn't receive a tracking number. I never got tracking information nor a response to my DM I sent yesterday. Can someone please update me? Anyone got their tracking numbers? I was wondering if you received my address in time? sorry for being absent minded Hi! I was just wondering if we will get tracking information? @Creator Just wondering how the shipping is going? Nevermind... I found it! I never received a DM.. Where are we supposed to post what we would like? Just curious about the stretch goals? How do I pick which seedlings I'll get and what are the options? This is such a great gift idea. My youngest son will love this! Are you doing any stretch goals? Does the container have an outlet for the excess water to drain? Hello! Is it possible to purchase more than one reward?
