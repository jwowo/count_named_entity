Dear Control VR Kickstarter Community, Let us start by saying that the response, feedback and suggestions of our backers and the VR community have been very valuable. Taking our technology forward from a prototype to a product is no easy task and we are working harder than ever to ensure we deliver a product that represents the leading edge in motion capture hardware and software and to ensure that our backers get the best system in the world. Following our campaign success we were faced with the large task of developing and growing our business. We have reached out or have been contacted by most major industry contributors (e.g. leading headset and application developers) and established working relationships to ensure that our products are in sync with the tools that the community needs and desires. Our team has grown and will continue to grow as we near the release date of the software development kit. Now let’s get straight to it! This update consists of a list of software and hardware changes, redesigns and new features that we have completed or are in the process of completing. These updates are the direct result of feedback and suggestions that we’ve concluded from listening to our community, going to events, trade shows and actively speaking to other companies. These changes will be shown in several developer updates in the coming months. In the coming weeks, we will also be demonstrating the latest developments at various VR events in Southern California and would like to invite you to join us at these events. If you are unable to join us there, we will also be opening up a developer communications platform and will be sharing exciting behind-the-scenes news that will demonstrate a firm commitment to driving innovation and working with the community for the long-term best interests of VR. Please feel free to reach out with comments, feedback and suggestions by sending us an email at <email> . Without further ado, please enjoy the video and the latest updates. -The Control VR Team <url>“southing” whereby the user was required to face geographical south. This orientation was required to allow the system to work accurately while allowing users to place the sensors in various locations and at varying angles on the body. The south is now calculated synthetically, making the whole system easier to initialize and more accurate. 4) As we prepare for the consumer-level market, we are in the process of reducing the cost of the sensors while improving their performance and robustness. We have designed new sensors to endure the everyday abuse of the system. 5) We are in the process of designing new straps, gloves and covers for our suits. We are using 3D printers to prototype and test designs and we have future plans of involving the community and our backers in that process. We want the new suit to be more comfortable to wear, less intrusive, and easier to put on or take off. 6) We are designing the new hardware with latency in mind. We are working towards reducing our system's already unnoticeable delay by reengineering our hardware (hub and sensor nodes), core drivers and client-side software. Software Updates 1) Our aim is to establish the new standard, in terms of simplicity and versatility for motion capture software, and we are working alongside some of the best and brightest in the industry and integrating solutions with leading developers and manufacturers. 2) We shifted a lot of our client-side (Unity, Unreal, etc.) to the core drivers, drastically simplifying the process of developing new software for our systems. Our SDK, which includes coding examples, will make the process of developing new applications very simple. 3) We developed a new and improved finger kinematics engine which replicates the anatomy of the human hand very accurately. 4) We are developing a system which determines the overall body proportions and posture of the motion performer during calibration to improve accuracy of the kinematic reconstruction. This will allow users to clap their hands and have one hand interact with the other much more accurately. This will be achieved through an intelligent kinematic model. 5) Optimized the software to remove software-induced latencies. Additionally, we are focusing on the computational efficiency and consequently performance of software to ensure that our SDK works efficiently on any computer without hogging the CPU or RAM. 6) We are developing a new software application, which will be shipped with ControlVR systems, which allows users to quickly visualize motion data and export animations in a variety of file formats. The recording of motion will be possible without the need of additional software applications (e.g. MotionBuilder). We will however continue to support plugins for animation software. 7) The SDK will include an application programming interface for those who are not interested in 3D game engines or animation software. User's will be able to develop their bespoke software in a variety of languages such as C++, C# and Java. 8) We are looking at supporting online multiplayer motion capture as well as having multiple suits connected to the same computer. The latter will be more suitable for high-fidelity motion recordings. 9) We integrated an inverse kinematics system with our in-game kinematics to improve the user’s interaction with the virtual environment. For example, punching through a virtual wall will prevent the avatar’s hand from clipping through the wall. The result is a much more natural motion that improves the overall VR experience. Stay tuned for more exciting updates in the weeks ahead! The Kickstarter is officially over, and we reached 176% of our goal! Thank you to everyone who supported us, whether you pledged, spread the word, or both. This Kickstarter would not have succeeded without you. Our website is now live at <url>
