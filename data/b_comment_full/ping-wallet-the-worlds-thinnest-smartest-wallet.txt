Thank you for your understanding and again our apology. Best, Link team Dear backers! Amazon has alerted me to several "failed" payment attempts through Kickstarter. Apparently, this is a VERY common problem when a credit card has expired or you have perhaps switched default cards through your Amazon account. Kickstarter gives you the chance to remedy this through your Amazon payments account. For more information on how to fix the situation, please see here: <url>"Locus*" which mean to locate, we love our new name. There is nothing to worry about: We are still on schedule to deliver by the due date, this modification will be completely transparent for you and we can't wait for you to have your Locus* Wallet. We here at Ping* Wallet would like to thank all of our supporters from the bottom of our hearts. We will be moving forward in processing all of your orders as scheduled. Please check back here or our website for future updates.
