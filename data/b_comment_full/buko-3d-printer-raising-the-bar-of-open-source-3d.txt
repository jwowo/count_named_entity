Hi Backers, First, sorry for the lack of updates, it's been crazy busy and stressing since trying to finish off the Bukobot kickstarter project and starting the Bukito one. We only have a handful of folks left that unfortunately are waiting a bit longer because of a couple of big last minute snags. We have been in contact personally with a few of the final remaining backers, but I can finally say we have everything to send every thing out and should be a matter of days to actually close the books on this project. Why this happened? One reason is my lack of experience and too much trust in suppliers (which I have learn many lessons of what not to do)...and the other is that a couple months ago, we thought we had all the components and I jumped the gun with the assumption we were going to be done fast...and then we found a few issues with the electronics. I tried my best to work with what we had (and actually sent out a few kits without some parts) but a last batch of drivers and heated boards were unacceptable so we had to get them completely redone. What made things worse is that the heated boards took much longer than promised and basically set us back a whole bunch of weeks. I apologize for this super extra delay, but until I actually had the new product in hand, I didn't want to predict any shipping time for the last few rewards because obviously my predictions never seem to be correct. I have lost a lot of sleep over this and almost freaked out about this situation, but tried my best to keep it together and to keep on going to finish everything. For those of you that got kits without the heated platforms (or the temporary bad ones), we are getting them ready as I write this and they will be sent out before the weekend. The end is now within reach on this project, and we will finally be able to move on to the next challenge... the Bukito. So as soon as I see the last reward go out on the Bukobot, we are going to focus hard on the Bukito. We have now stabilized most of the Bukobot production (finally) and we will continue to offer the Bukobot on our website at Deezmaker.com Bukobot.com Wiki We have updated some more of the Bukobot wiki if you haven't see it lately. Check it out at Bukobot.com . If you have any suggestions or tips you think we should add to it, let us know on the forum. New extruders for 1st Gen Bukobots For those that got a Bukobot a long time ago and have the first generation with the "Bukoschnozzle", I would like to know how many of you are actually interested in an upgrade kit to the new Spitfire nozzle. If you are interested, send me a message so I can see if there's enough demand to start getting that ready. I haven't calculated the exact cost, but it would be around $100 for single, about $140 for dual to include everything you need for the new setup (New spitfire nozzle, new X carriage, new idler assembly, but without motor, drive gear or fan.) What's next Well, the Bukito is now our next focus, but soon we should be starting work on completely new machine (no name yet) that will be pretty amazing (assuming our theories work out correctly) and have a different approach...but we'll talk about that later... For now, we will continue to send out updates as cool things happen at Deezmaker and will try to stay in touch with all of you, the original and awesome backers of the Bukobot project. Your support for this project has been extremely wonderful and I hope you feel that you will always be part of the adventurous soul of Bukobots and Deezmaker. 3D printing is evolving fast and we hope to keep up and stay innovative. Hi Folks, Thanks again for everyone's patience in this project. We are doing our best to get the final kits out fast, but as accurate as possible with this new model. The transition was a bit tricky since so much of the design has changed and we now have it all figured out and going smoother. We shipped a few kits out to test the new model kits a couple weeks back and had discovered some little issues but are now fixed them and continued shipping more (Pictures of our small operation below). We had a bunch go out the last couple weeks, but still got a few more to go. Although a few folks already got the new models, I haven't had time to sit down in one place to get the instructions up on the wiki...which is my goal to do today (despite that it's my birthday, no days off for me). I did make some videos now so it might be a bit easier for everyone. The cool news is that in making the instructions, I realized that it took a couple hours less to put together, even for us, so build time is much less now with the Bukobot v2. Also, more parts we were needing actually came in last week so it doesn't look like we will ship any partial kits. <url>"re-launched" the "Bukito" 3d printer on Kickstarter on it's own to anticipate the finish of this one ( <url>"Bukito" on the Bukobot project, but was overwhelmed by the big models to be able focus more time on it. We then ran across the "V-slot" project from open builds and found the perfect solution to make it the way we wanted it. So for those few that got the Bukito, you'll be getting it as soon as we make a few more of them in the next few weeks, before this project and with some added bonuses. Again, thank to all for the support and patience. If you are the small few left to get a Bukobot, I apologize for the additional delays, but you should be getting your shipment and tracking info within days. There has been so much to do, I haven't been able to write up more updates, but will try to do another one very soon when the instructions are more complete. Hi folks, Things are moving along good. We should have a bunch of kits shipping this week. Here's some quick pictures of the assembly, some laser parts and the extruders, in which we are pre-assembling for you guys to make things easier since the instruction for the new model are not totally ready. We are also having some cool announcements going on this week, so stay tuned to our website and twitter and stuff... Hey Folks, First, I think we just might actually make the goal of finishing most of the last kickstarter rewards before July. Here's the quick run down before you check out the pictures... We have parts! Our "Spitfire" Extruder parts are here, and colorful! So if some final things get delivered in the steady schedule that we have finally been able to accomplish, I think most kits will be out the door before the end of the month. But we have a simple back up plan just in case... So here's an idea (if everyone is ok with it): We were thinking of sending out the kits even if some minor parts are not available at the time of shipping (which we'll keep track of and send out when we get them). I really want to get all the kits out to you guys as fast as humanly possible, but I have a feeling we might not get everything little piece in time so I want to prepare for it just in case. Of course, this is just a back plan that I hope we will avoid. On another note, below you'll see some pictures / renderings of the new model that everyone is now getting. Since some parts actually came a little early, I had the X carriage (Gold) and the Spitfire extruder aluminum parts (Red) anodized here at local place, which only took a day to do. Not sure if you agree with us, but this little extra coloring make things look really hot! We've been working hard testing the details of the new model to make sure you guys get the best Bukobot ever. We've made a lot of refinements and improvements. Although I haven't yet counted exactly, I think we reduced the parts count to about half, all while still improving things. This also means the build time is much faster and easier too. Speaking of which, since the new model was designed in more professional CAD software, we will have really nice pictures and diagrams of the new assembly. Almost done... So after about a year of living and breathing 3D printing everyday, we learned some awesome things that we tried to implement in this new model. I think you'll be very pleased, not by just the experience of building it, but the improved performance we are able to achieve. And of course, I'm extremely grateful of everyone's patience and support through this project with the extremely challenging process of making a great 3D printer. The closing of this chapter is very near, and I know the final few that are left to receive Bukobots have been very anxious (and very very patient with me), but to us, it'll be a start of a grander journey that I hope to take all of you with us. We do feel everyone that helped backed this project has been a huge part of our success and we are eternally grateful, so as an extra bonus, we will try (as much as possible) to give you guys discounts and special deals on future product offerings. So I'm concluding this update for now and going back to work on preparing and packing the last rewards you'll be getting soon. Hope you enjoy the pictures of the new stuff! ..and Happy Father's day! Hi Backers... We are at the Maker Faire Bay Area this weekend (May 18th, 19th 2013, makerfaire.com ) and we are going to show some cool stuff that you guys are going to get soon (for the last few folks that haven't gotten your Bukobots yet). As a special treat, I'm showing these pictures to you guys first! Since I'm on the road, I'm going to make this short and I'll answer questions after the faire next week. I hope you guys like it them, because we are in full transition into the new awesome changes. P.S. If you come to the Maker Faire, visit us at booth 305 in the Expo Hall... P.S.S ...and yes, we now have a power supply holder...and we'll post the design files for it soon : ) Hi Folks...my very patient backers... So here's a quick update. After weeks of suffering from some supply vendors, we finally got some final parts to send out more kits next week for the current models (those that want your machine quicker) so some of you will be hearing from me soon about your shipments. If anyone wants the new nozzle setup (and hasn't told us yet), please let me know ASAP or we will assume you want the current model. Keep in mind, it'll still be a few more weeks for the newer one to be ready. Also, if all goes to plan, we might have some kits ready with the new nozzle for the Maker Faire in San Mateo next month (but no promises because I've been let down by some vendors too many times). If you want to meet us there and pickup your kit, let me know and we can try to arrange it. After much testing of the new nozzle setup, which we now call "Spitfire" (let me know if you have a better name ; ), they are now being produced since we are mostly finalized on the major parts. It'll still be about 3 weeks or so for all the piece to get made. So far it's been very good and fast with mostly everything we run through it. We've also been printing nylon a lot with it and it's just awesome! Check out this iPhone case we printed: <url># Which reminds me, I got an instagram account now <url># , so follow it to see what's going on with us and to see cool things we print. It seems to be the easiest (and least time consuming) way to post pictures. I'll try to shoot some Bukobot production photos too. We are also having another batch of the Tatsu drive gear made since we are almost out of them, but also because we are making some improvements for the new nozzle setup. Since our new "Spitfire" nozzle works with so many different materials, we wanted to increase the depth and sharpness to grip everything from soft PVA to polycarbonate. Basically, we wanted a bigger bite! I'll try to get some pictures soon to show you guys the difference once we have a few of the final ones made. The link below is video of the next batch of Tatsu drive gears being made at Marples Gear, near by in Alhambra, California. They use very awesome, and very serious, gear making machines. Stainless steel is not the easiest to work with, but long lasting and sharp teeth! No compromises! <url>"Expansion Shield V1.1" in the "Details" at : <url>"SureStepr". They have a new chip that won't break a sweat at normal speeds, but now have 1/32 step option (previous was 1/16 max). See this page for more details on these: <url>"Bukoschnozzle" (which is our derivative of the "Budaschonzzle" from Lulzbot <url>#1 we want to go faster and the best way to do that is with higher temperatures, #2 we want to use polycarbonate and nylon which also need higher temperatures. Currently, we can extrude just a little faster with the Bukoschnozzle, but the higher temperatures we want would be getting close to a dangerous zone because it has a teflon (PTFE) tube inside that can be a bit unsafe if you heat it beyond 260c degrees (this is a reason for the fan). So the new extruder (no name yet, suggestion welcome) will be pretty much all metal and should be able to reach at least 320c with no issues. We have a rough prototype running here at the shop and we have actually printed some polycarbonate and nylon test parts. The results so far are pretty cool and very promising. It's still a couple weeks until it's ready to actually produce but if all goes well, we are going to phase out the Bukoschnozzle with the new one. The cool part about it is that I'll have an upgrade kit you can get (with a discount for kickstarters of course) for anyone that wants to get the new nozzle once it's ready. In addition to the higher temperatures, here's a break down of features we want the new nozzle to have (hopefully we can implement all of them) Uses the same motor and "Tatsu" drive gear, so if you already have a Bukobot, there will be an simple upgrade for it to swap out the old extruder body and nozzle. Easier nozzle swap and cleaning. Simpler parts and easier to get manufactured. No PLA leaking at high temperatures. Mostly metal design to run higher temperatures without issues, no PEEK or PTFE (teflon). More compact and shorter nozzle, which means you can go dual with the Bukobot 8 Vanilla or 8 Green without losing much build volume: 8x8x8 will become something like 7x8x9 with dual extruders. More compact also means the duo's will have a TRIPLE extruder upgrade available! When combined with the new "Extension Shield" for the X3, you'll be able to add the necessary drivers and heat controls. We will be able to offer 3mm or 1.75mm size nozzles a lot easier. Higher temperature capacity means faster speeds possible! Easier to level dual extruders Posted STL Files So keeping true to the open source concept, we have finally post all the parts from our latest version of the kits. It took us a while because unfortunately I'm a perfectionist and I don't like to share things that are not..well perfect. I know things will never be perfect, but it's high quality enough to be posted at this point and you can find them as links in "Parts List" <url>"3D Object Files" page at <url>"bukobot shipped to you" message with tracking info, then you can take advantage of this option. So here's the deal: We still have a bunch of the regular nozzles (bukoschnozzle) that we are going to use for the next shipments (kickstarters and pre-orders after that), but if you want the new nozzle and some of the other new improvements without any extra cost, I will give you guys first pick to get them... WITH SMALL CONDITIONS : First off, the new nozzles seems to work great at the moment but will be considered "experimental" until more long term testing is done and can possibly be a little challenging to setup at first until we have the best settings for you. Second, your shipment will be delayed longer because they will take a few more weeks to get them ready for kits. So to sum up this deal: If you want the new nozzles (which does higher temperatures, faster, and does polycarbonate &amp; nylon too) and some new improvements AND you don't mind a longer wait time (a few more weeks at least), then contact me and say "YES, please delay my reward to get the new nozzle". If you rather not wait any longer, it's not a problem and you will get your reward as soon as we can ship it in the next few batches. For kickstarters that already got their kits and want the new nozzle, I will give you a personal discount code if you email me when we have the upgrade option on the online store or announce it on another update. Back to work... It has taking the span of a few days to write this update and to be honest, I have never been so exhausted in my life as I have been in these last few months. You can ask anyone about my schedule and they will tell you that I come to the shop and work at least 12 hours everyday to try to survive and grow this endeavor. But I'm not mentioning this to sound like there's any regrets or to get sympathy, but more to let everyone know that I'm fully dedicate to make this business succeed and hopefully grow beyond this project. I know I'm definitely far from perfect, but I'm trying the best I know how to make things work and in trying to make everyone happy. Even after spending everyday in the last few months thinking, talking and breathing 3D printing, I still think it's this is coolest thing ever and I hope to create great 3D printers to unleash everybody creativity and passions as it has mine. So once again, I apologize greatly for those that have not received your reward yet, but I promise you'll get it soon and I hope you will hang in there with me. (Sorry no pictures, I haven't even had time or energy to take any...but hopefully will post some soon.) Hi Backers! I hope everyone had or is having a wonderful holiday season in all parts of the world. We wish everyone peace and happiness. Here's a quick update to let everyone know what's going on. I know I haven't been communicating much, but I've been focused on working hard in getting the rest of the kits out and haven't had time to even work on the wiki. My apologies for not getting some kits out before the Christmas holidays. Although we gave a strong push before Christmas, we still have many more to go. Last tally, it's looking like we are past half way point through the rewards of the Bukobot kits. I have sent out a few international ones to check for any major issues before committing too many to make sure everything is ok. Our next batch is mostly ready for international, so you will be getting an email soon to double check your shipping destinations right before they ship. As a quick reminder, the wiki for the Bukobot is Bukobot.com and the forum is at Forum.Bukobot.com . If anyone has any good tips about their build experience so far, please share and post it on the wiki or forum. Although we have worked hard to make the build as easy as possible, I'm sure there's some cool tips some of you have figured out. We realize we have some bottlenecks in production and we are getting better at speeding things up on every batch. I've never had to manage production and people before and I've discovered that it's not as easy as I thought. So, we are continuing to work hard to ship all the kits out as fast as humanly possible. We appreciate your patience once again and I know you will enjoy the Bukobot when everyone get theirs. We wish you a happy new year and hope everyone is spending quality time with their families. Hi Folks, Hope all is well and everyone is getting ready for the holiday season. We are still hard at work getting packing and shipping done. We got a whole bunch out the door so far and many local backers have even picked them up at my shop too. We are doing batches of about 20 or so at a time to make sure we do things right and so it doesn't get too crazy and miss anything. I'm send out personal emails to let you know when your reward is about to ship so if there's any last minute details we can make sure it's correct, so please reply as soon as you get it. As for folks that are about to receive them (or ones that want to get an early start), we have started creating the wiki and have a few backers that have already contributed some instructions and ideas for the assembly of the kits. The site is at Bukobot.com to make things easy and simple. I have also setup the Bukobot forum at forum.bukobot.com for general discussions, tips and collaboration on everything 3D printing and Bukobot related. It was kind of setup quickly (don't have a lot of time for extra stuff lately) so I'm trusting that you guys will let me know if everything is working ok or if there's any suggestions to make it better. So it's looking like I'm only going to have one day off this week thanks to thanksgiving because we're trying hard to ship out a bunch before Thursday. I'm really trying to put in a little extra effort to get out as much as we can so you can enjoy your rewards during the holidays. For those that may have already gotten your kits and want to share the experience or pictures, we would love to see them posted in the new forum. Any little advice or tip could help us and other backers make the experience of the Bukobot better. A quick and cool side note, we were featured in the latest issue in MAKE magazine ( <url>"grand opening" of the shop because I needed push myself (and a few others...) to setup the shop and move everything from my garage and house as soon as possible into a bigger work area. Having an event like this helped create a deadline to get things done a bit faster (although very stressing). Now that the shop is finally mostly set up for production, we have been able to be more organized and efficient in getting things done. As you may see from the pictures below, the grand opening turned out to be a great success and I was able to meet many new local people interested in 3D printing. Many others showed up including some vendors (Panucatt Devices, Printbl.com ), friends, family and a handful of local backers of the Bukobot project. I even had the privilege of meeting a backer that happened to be visiting from Australia and I was able to give him a partial kit to take back home. There were about 5 local backers that came to meet the Bukobots in person. All in all, it was great to meet such cool people and I'm very thankful to my family for helping me put it together. The Maker Faire in New York was an extremely hard and exhausting event to do. In addition to building 3 working Bukobots and getting a few kits together as best we could, we only had 3 days to do it all after the grand opening. The Monday after the grand opening, we were at full speed getting the Bukobots built, running, and then packed for the trip. Although it wasn't easy, it did prove that Bukobots are pretty easy to assemble. We ended up building a Mini Green, 8 Vanilla and a Duo for the Maker Faire and also brought along a few extra kits. I think the best part of the trip was the fact that we were able to deliver most of the demo machines and some of the kits to local New York backers. Although some of the kits were missing a few minor parts, we still ended up getting five Bukobots into the hands of backers. One of the backers I was able to meet and deliver a Bukobot to was a wonderful and sweet school teacher that was waiting a few years to get a working 3D printer for her school. She told me that she bought a Makerbot Thing-o-matic a long time ago and that unfortunately she was never able to get it to print or work properly. So the great part of this story was that I was able to give her one of our fresh demo units from the Maker Faire so she could have a perfectly working 3d printer for her students. Being at the Maker Faire was a great experience. I was fortunate enough to meet some of, what I call, the "greats" of the 3D printing universe. Among those (just to name a few) were Josef Prusa, Dave Durant, Tony Buser, Aaron Double, John Abella, Jeff Keegan, Matthew Griffin, Rob Giseburt, Mat Stultz, the guys from Hive76...and so many more from other 3D printer companies and makers. I did learn some really cool things and saw some cool new ideas in 3D printing that we may try to incorporate into future designs. What's happening now... We are getting close, really close! We only have a few minor parts to get to complete the kits and the major shipping will begin. This week I have two goals that I want to accomplish and we are even adding another person to the team to help out. Look out for a survey in a couple days asking for your shipping information and details. #1 - Finish shipping the smaller rewards that are left, including the "plastics only" kits since we finally got all the parts in last week for those. #2 - Start shipping some kits. Even though I may have to get some components at much higher costs from local sources, I think once a few kits get shipped, it'll start the momentum and help get us into a shipping mode. What's coming... While we are ramping up the major shipping, we are also working on the final materials list, 3D object files and some instructions for the building of the Bukobots. Our goals for next weeks is to post files and more information on a wiki on our site and some others to honor the open source promise we made. Also, we are looking to setup a forum on the deezmaker website so you can find some information and ask questions to us and the community. So these next few week will be a lot of hard work for us, but we are more focused and determined to get these Bukobots out to everyone now that all the dust has settled with these past events. So I hope you enjoy the pictures below of the grand opening, Maker Faire NY, some new production shots and assembly parts. Again, thank you for your patience and support in this project. Hi wonderful...and patient backers! This update is actually an update to tell you that an update is coming... : ) We have finally landed from all the events and back to full production mode. Between production of your Bukobots, the grand opening of the 3d printer shop and the Maker Faire event, these last few weeks have really taken a lot of juice out of me... But I finally got a couple of decent days of sleep to recharge my batteries a bit and I'm now ready for action again. So, this weekend, I will sit down and gather my thoughts and write up an update of what happened, is happening and going to happen... so stay tuned... Thanks again for your patience, we are trying our best to make sure you get the best 3D printer we can produce. Quick News: I was able to personally deliver a few kits (although some a little incomplete) to some backers during my visit to New York, so we now have a few backers with our kits... but more details to come. Hi folks, So I have to be honest, I have some cool news but also some not so cool news. In advance, I apologize again for things not being done as fast as I want them to, even though we have been hammering away on this project night and day for the last few months. Not so cool news first, but please read the whole update, there's better news below. To start with, we still don't have enough parts in to deliver any Bukobots yet. We are still waiting for the controller boards, drivers, heat beds along with some miscellaneous hardware parts (but important parts, like linear rods, seems like they don't like metric sizes here in the USA) to complete some kits to ship. I spoke to Roy (the electronics guy at Panucatt devices) and he told me that his suppliers delayed his shipment more than promised, so we are both in the same slow boat. Unfortunately, it's a little out of our control on these things and we are at the mercy of the manufacturers and suppliers sometimes, so it's just a matter of waiting until the parts get to us. So I think I won't be able to start shipping anything until (fingers crossed) end of next week. The worst part is that it has now become a bad timing issue because we leave to New York for the Maker Faire on the 27th and we have to prepare for that a little bit so it might delay things more. We will be back Oct 3rd with full force to continue non-stop to get these kits out to everyone as soon as possible. I think by then, we should have everything we need to hammer out all the rewards in a few weeks. Again, I apologize for the delays and I really wish things would have come sooner. On the positive side, this has been a great learning process and we are starting to see what to expect for future projects. Now for some good and cool news... We were able to participate in the Google+ Hangout event hosted by MAKE Magazine so check out the links below. We also had to print some special objects this week that MAKE supplied for the review. Some were a bit challenging, but I hope we will be in the top of the good list. Here's some pictures and the recording of the event: See if you can spot all the Bukobot pictures: <url>#! Meet the Tatsu Drive Gear (See pictures below). Today we finally got all the Tatsu drive gears we ordered so I can cross that off the list finally. As I mentioned before, this drive gear, named Tatsu ( "Dragon" in Japanese), is just super awesome and beautiful. It was specially designed by us and since the machine shop was local, I was able to supervise the first prototypes to make sure they came out perfect. Unfortunately, our design was a bit tricky to make and they kept breaking expensive tools to make them, so it took them longer to deliver them. I don't think anyone has drive gears designed like these, they really have nice sharp teeth. A cool feature is that it's designed to work with 3mm (standard size for Bukobots) filament but can also work on 1.75mm filament if you ever choose to change the nozzle size. It's made of high quality hardened stainless steel so it will probably never wear out or let anything get stuck to it...in other words, it's strong, long lasting and easy to clean. The grip on the filament has been so amazing that one of our Bukobot's filament rolls got tangled up once (when we weren't watching, our fault) and it almost tilted the whole machine sideways off the table! It truly is an awesome drive gear, and of course, it's comes standard on all the Bukobots. All the aluminum extrusions are now officially in (See pictures). Thursday, I finally personally picked up the remaining (and huge 1000lbs) order for the Bukobots frames. That's now crossed off the list! This weekend I should be able to pick up a few controler boards from Roy (he got some partials in that will help out), so that might help us get a few kits ready to start some shipping next week. Printed parts are all getting done nicely, everyday we have our Bukobot army printing away as many parts fit on each 8" platform (including a 12" experimental one). I haven't calculated it precisely, but I think we are making about 4 to 6 complete sets of parts per day at the moment with only a few machines. The new "Deezmaker 3D Printer Store &amp; Hackerspace" is slowly coming together and I hope it'll be a little more decent for the grand opening we have on the 23rd. Things are a bit messy right now because we been focusing on trying to get the Bukobots ready, but I think with some help from the family we'll get it looking nice. Please tell all your friends in the Los Angeles area to come to the grand opening on the 23rd, it should be fun! Here's the official announcement: Deezmaker Grand Opening So in conclusion, there's not many parts left to get and we are starting to prepare most things for shipping. I hate to say it, but so far I think this project has added many grey hairs to my head. It's really been exhausting and a huge learning experience, especially when little things go wrong that prevent other big things from progressing. Again, apologies for the delays but I was really hoping to keep the schedule to what I started with. With some unexpected minor set backs we experienced and some underestimated delivery times, a big lesson so far in this adventure is that vendors seem to give very approximate lead times that usually end up longer that expected, especially with higher quantity custom items. Enjoy the pictures, and thank you so much for your support and patience. I apologize for such a long delay since the last update and I truly appreciate your patience with this project. We have been swamped with the production of the Bukobots and I haven’t found much time to even take pictures or post our progress. It’s definitely feeling like things are happening and changing much faster than I can talk about them... The Bukobot 3D printer is my full time life since May 2012 and I am really putting my heart and soul (and some sleepless nights) into this to give you a really great machine you will fall in love with to create amazing things, and hopefully show all your friends what it can do. So I know this is another long update, but I’m going to try harder next time to make shorter ones and more often. Again, I really appreciate your patience and support on the project...we are trying our best to please everyone. Summary of what will be mentioned on this update: - Bukobot &amp; the Mars Rover - Big announcement (got to read it) - Production Updates - Parts Details - Make Faire NY - Make Magazine Trip Bukobot &amp; the Mars Rovers Believe it or not, but the Bukobot has a few little connections to the newly-landed Mars rover "Curiosity". First off, as you may have read before, I was invited to show off the Bukobot at NASA's JPL to demo what an affordable 3D printer can do for the NASA engineers and technical staff. I’m pretty sure I spoke to a few of the folks that were directly involved with the Mars rover landing. Second, our brand new and custom extruder drive gear (named "Tatsu", which means "dragon" in Japanese ) is being manufactured by a specialized local gear company that has also made gears for many NASA projects, including the Mars rovers. This means you are getting probably one of the best extruder drive gears in the 3D printer world. (Read more about "Tatsu" below) The other relation to the Mars rover that the Bukobots have is that they were both born in beautiful Pasadena, California! As you may already know, I'm based in Pasadena and we have the privilege of being surrounded with amazing technology campuses, like JPL, Caltech and the Pasadena Art Center. (see the attached picture of a printed "Curiosity" rover - Thingiverse: <url>…And speaking of Pasadena, I have a pretty big announcement…and you, being a backer that got this project kickstarted will be one of the first to know about this one before I officially announce it on the website… Because of your encouragement of this project and my persistence to gather some extras resources (including special favors from people close to me) I am pleased to announce that we are opening, and hopefully be the first in California, an official "Deezmaker 3D Printer Shop" retail shop AND “Hackerspace”, right here in Pasadena! The keys are in my hands and if all goes to plan, it should be ready (mostly) to open to the public around mid September. Now before anyone gets too excited (or worried) and although I know this is a big step to take for me (but I do have people helping to me), this new adventure should not affect the production of the Bukobots or create any extra delays. Actually, having a real location to build kits and organize everything should help make things smoother and faster for us to deliver your Bukobots (unlike my very hot and tiny garage!). The retail space is modest to start with (about 900 square feet, my garage was barely about 250...) and since the economy has been a little bad in the leasing business, I got a pretty good deal. This has been a dream of mine for a while now, even before the Bukobot project. One of the main reasons that drove me to dive into this new adventure is that fact that 3D printing is the future of home fabrication and showing its potential to people with live working 3D printers will help spread the word better than any other method. I noticed that when I would do a demo at a school or have someone come over my house to show them a Bukobot, I would see their imaginations running wild in their eyes like if the doors opened to the skies of endless possibilities. So the main purpose of this store/hackerspace is to have a place where people can experience 3D printing in person and learn how awesome it is to help make ideas into reality. The new "Deezmaker 3D Printer Shop" will also have other awesome benefits to those in the Los Angeles area that have ordered a Bukobot or want to see (or even use) a Bukobot in person. So for those willing to drive to Pasadena, I can now offer the chance for you to personally pick up your Bukobot and since it'll save some shipping costs, you will also get all the personal lessons on how to use a Bukobot. In addition to offering my Bukobot 3D printers at the shop, I will also have 3D printing supplies, tech support for almost any Reprap 3D printer and a "Hackerspace" / "Makerspace" area for those that need a cool place to build awesome personal projects. With time, I will also be adding special machines like CNC routers and laser cutters. So if you are a backer on not, I invite you to drop by as soon as we announce the opening on our website. It will be announce on twitter of course, so follow me there if you like or add yourself to the mailing list that I have added to the home page at deezmaker.com . Now for some Bukobot production updates Things are going mostly good in regards to getting parts in, but there is just so much going on. The only little bad news is that it is looking like shipping may be more towards end of September because of some supply issues beyond our control that we are having with a few of our vendors. The good news is that on some things we have received partial quantities, so we might be able to ship some models as soon as we complete other important parts. I think in general, we have about 90% of the parts we need, unfortunately we are waiting for some of the critical ones that can’t be substituted. New details on some parts - The New "Helios" Heated Platform The new "Helios" heated platform from Panucatt devices, which is included on the Vanilla and Duo Bukobots, has been finalized and sent to be made. We expect to have them in this next week along with the X3 boards and the motor drivers. If you see in the pictures, we have received the X1 boards already, but we need the drivers to complete them. - The New "Tatsu" Drive Gear Our new "Tatsu" drive gear is partially delivered (I only got about 20% of the order so far) because it's actually been really hard to manufacture so it's taking a little longer than I would like, but we should be getting the rest of them this week. I think the wait is worth it because new drive gear is really awesome, it grips PLA and ABS like there's no tomorrow! It might not sound like a big deal because it's such a small part, but believe me, ask anyone in the 3D printing world and they will say the drive gear is one of the most important (and usually most challenging) part to get excellent quality prints. I'm not one to brag much, but I really think we might have the best drive gear in the Reprap 3D printer community, and you get to have one (or two for Duo) on your Bukobots! I was really looking for a better drive gear because the current ones I've been using were ok, but I didn't think they were good enough nor reliable with PLA or harder plastics like polycarbonate. With our new custom design, I'm now even more confident of the reliability of our extruder's performance. One of the main issues with drive gears is that when using PLA, which is much harder than ABS, most drive gears can't seem to dig in deep enough to get a good grip on your material and end up slipping and eating up your filament instead of pushing it through the hot end. But now with our "Tatsu" drive gear, our tests seem to show that it's more reliable and has even more precision in feeding all our materials. - The Hot End (Extruder Tip) As you know, we were planning on using the "Budaschnozzle 1.1" from Lulzbot as the default hot end for the Bukobots. Although we tried to get them directly from Lulzbot to supply the Bukobots, we decide to get them manufactured locally instead since it is an open source design and a derivative of the Arcol Hot-End v3 too. We made this decision because we were a little worried about the lead time and felt that making them locally will give us little more control, but we also wanted some design changes we felt were needed for our purpose. The result is the "Bukoschnozzle". There's some minor differences between our hot end and the Budaschnozzle if you look at the pictures and compare. One main thing we didn't like was the copper heat sink so we design a nicer and bigger finned aluminum piece that actually replaces two other parts and helps make the nozzle straighter and cooler on the top section. The other big change was the redesign of the bottom plate that holds everything together. Instead of a thin steal plate and a piece of wood (that seemed to break after a while of use) we designed a single, water jet cut aluminum piece that actually helps heat sink the PEEK plastic even better, won't bend very easily (like the steal did) and reduces parts. - The Duo Thanks to the developers of the open source software ( Slic3r.org ) and the addition of us finalizing some parts for the Bukobot Duo, a few weeks ago we were able to successfully make some great two color prints with the Duo! With Slic3r’s (built in to Repeteir-Host) new multiple extruder options you’ll be able to do two material objects a little easier with the Bukobot Duo. - The New Y Carriage Design As I mentioned last time, the new Y carriage design is so much better now and we love it. Check out the picture to see the big differences on the original designs and the new one. It will make it much easier to assemble (from 16 parts to now only 8!), align and level since we have made it even stronger. We are now using 3-point mounting for super easy platform leveling. Thanks the to very strudy Helios heated bed, we can now mount the platform on just three points to avoid major platform warping and difficult adjustments. - Things still needed The only other major parts that are needed should be coming in next week hopefully and maybe the week after that at most, but as soon as we have enough parts to complete kits, I will try my best to start shipping them out. Getting some parts seemed to have been a lot more challenging than I would have ever expected. We also have a few Bukobots printing parts like crazy everyday and still have a lot to go, so that will still take some time to finish, but we can still get kits ready as the parts are finished. - Other smaller rewards The keychains have finally all been sent out, but we got delayed a bit because we were having some minor issues with the postal service and the software that makes the postage for them. If you are in the USA and didn’t get yours yet, please let me know so I can try to figure out why. As for the prototype pieces, unfortunately we’ve been so busy everyday trying to solve production issues and dealing with vendors that I haven’t been able to send any out. For those waiting for the prototype pieces, I'm really sorry, but producing the Bukobots has been a little bit of a higher priority at the moment, so I don’t think they will be sent out until possibly next week. BUT don't worry, you'll get them soon! As an extra bonus for your patience and since the end of the Bukobot kickstarter, I have even more prototype pieces to give so I’m including several more in your shipments, including a Bukobot keychain. Make Faire NY This month, the Make Faire in New York takes place (Sept 29-30) and we had the privilege of be accepted to show off the Bukobots at the 3D printer village there. In other words, Deezmaker and the Bukobots will be at Maker Faire NY! If you are going (or live close to NY) and you have a reward coming to you, please let me know! I might be able to take some kits with me if you want to pick them up personally. We will have a small booth in the “3D printer village” (we are maker #8666), so if you get to attend the Faire, please look visit us and we’ll give you some 3D printer goodies. More info at <url>“Ultimate Guide to 3D Printing”. Since we are in full production mode and a recent Kickstarter project, they thought we weren’t ready to let them borrow a Bukobot for some tests and the deadline was the 23rd to send a printer. Fortunately, I jump on the chance and convinced them to extended the deadline a few days to include the Bukobot. So last week Rich and I spent a couple of long days building a fresh looking Bukobot for them. We did have other Bukobots we could have given them, but our “production” ones aren’t really pretty and photogenic (and not to mention used to make our parts). So we ended up make a quick one with all the latest parts. In addition, to make sure our entry was guaranteed, I decided to actually drive up to their headquaters and deliver our Bukobot in person (only a 7 hour drive). The greatest thing about the trip was that I got to meet some wonderful people that create the stuff you see in the magazine and I was able to setup the Bukobot and made sure it was ready for testing (which was pretty easy anyways). The End Of Update...for now... So that's it for this update... I could’ve added some more minor things, but I’ll save it for the next update since this one was so long... And again, thanks for everyone’s amazing support of the Bukobot 3D printer! Below are some pictures of the Bukobot production (my cramped garage with boxes), my visit to Make magazine, the new shop being painted and other detail shots of the Bukobot we took for Make magazine... hope you enjoy them. For more photos, go to: <url>"plastics only" rewards but I've really had to focus hard on getting some critical things done for the Bukobots so I can try to keep things as close to schedule as possible. Key chains and Prototype pieces are being shipped this week. As for the Bukobots, some parts have just been taking a long time to get made, delivered or finalized from vendors. We are working hard to get everything on time, and to be honest with everyone, there might be a small chance that shipping of the Bukobot kits may crawl into September, but I'm trying my best to avoid that. As you might have already known, I have opened the "Deezmaker Store" at deezmaker.com to get pre-orders for the next batch. If you know any friends or family that wants a Bukobot, you should try to order it quickly (using "kickstarter" coupon code) so I can try to add it to the end of this batch. I have ordered a few extras of everything so I should be able to ship some extra Bukobots around September, immediately after the Kickstart batch. So don't forget to tell everyone you are getting one! Here's a quick status of what's going on with supplies: Key chains: Done, ready to ship Prototype Pieces: ready to ship Bukobot "Plastics Only" Reward: Almost ready to ship (read below) Bukobot Kits Progress.... Parts that have arrived or finished : Motors, Geared Motors, Power Supplies, Synchromesh Cables, Bearings, X1 Boards, Linear Bearings, Fans Parts almost ready or close to arriving : Final design tweaks and testing, hot ends, X3 Boards, Synchromesh Pulleys, Aluminum parts, Screws/Nuts, Rods, plastic materials (filament), other little stuff. Parts not ready, but should be around mid August : Heated platform, stepper drivers, printed plastic parts, some wiring, misc items. Now for some great news... To help me out in making Deezmaker the best 3D printing company possible (and trying to keep things on schedule), I got the privilege of adding to my team one of the coolest guys you can get for 3D printing. His name is Rich (AKA "whosawhatsis"), the creator of the "Wallace" reprap 3D printer (front page of RepRap.org ) and a total 3D printer guru. Since he lives close to me and wasn't deeply committed to any fun jobs, he accepted my offer to jump aboard the Deezmaker 3D printing team. He's been in doing 3D printing longer than me and has experience with tons of things relating to 3D printing. So look him up on the web ( whosawhatsis.com ) and you'll see what awesome stuff we might be creating together. Check out Rich's announcement: <url>"plastic only" rewards , there has been some awesome design tweaks that I really wanted include before sending them out (so you have the latest) that I think you'll be happy to see. Your "plastics only" kit is not just plastic any more! I've re-designed some parts that are now aluminum plate which makes them super strong, more precise, very easy to work with and much more efficient for us to manufacture too. So I do believe the little extra wait for your parts will be worth it. For the rest of my backers anxiously waiting for the Bukobots, there's some really cool stuff going on. Rich and I have been really working hard to make the Bukobot the best 3D printer possible. Although the Bukobots were pretty good to start with, we have been testing, tweaking, re-designing almost all the parts to make it better, easier to build and just awesome! Below are the descriptions of some of the latest major changes we have been working on. We have also been working closely with Panucatt Devices ( panucatt.com ) with the electronics and they are coming out amazing! Take a look at the pictures. New on the Bukobot: The NEW X Carriage (Shown in pictures, compare from old version) This is where the extruder mounts to slide back and forth. This used to be all ABS plastic, which works fine, but since the extruder deals with a lot of heat, I wanted to do something better. What we came up with is an extremely simple design with a single aluminum plate. This in turn gives you a whole bunch of new features too. #1 - Aluminum is much stronger and helps keep the extruder system much cooler (like a heat sink) verses ABS plastic. #2 - The bearing holders are now separate pieces so they can be upgraded or changed to something different in the future without replacing the whole X carriage. #3 - Much faster to produce locally, although this plate is cut out with popular water jet systems, it can still be made by hand if needed. #4 - Increases accuracy because of reduced flexing of the extruder compared to ABS plastic. #5 - We now use a special bridge to connect two of these for the dual extruders for more precise alignment. X3 Features The X3 controller board has not changed much, but it looks like it will now be a cool looking black board, with yellow writing on it and some neat blue LEDs to light it up when it's on. We are also working on a way to let you hack in a bluetooth module for wireless control. Some features it already has are: Dual extruder ready, SD card reader, nice LEDs indicators, Voltage Booster ready (separate module), LCD / Control Pad connection and it uses the ATMEL 1284P 16mhz surface mount chip. New Awesome Better (and Looking) Hot Bed Platform (for Vanillas and Duos) We've been working close with Panucatt Device to make the ultimate heated bed platform for the Bukobots and this one is turning out awesome! Check out the pictures and you'll see it'll be the coolest looking hot bed of any 3D printer! The Bukobots are the first printers to include this bed design so your friends will be jealous! Features: - Screw mounted power connectors to avoid common problems with soldered connections - Super thick (3.4mm) and high temperature rated PCB eliminates using other support materials to make the whole platform lighter and less prone to warping - Built-in surface mount LED power indicator and an integrated connection with center hole for thermistor so no more taping thermistor with wires! If you have a "Green" model, don't worry, we will be offering the platform later as an upgrade. New Aluminum Simplified Y Carriage So to hold this new Hot Bed, I ended up re-designing the Y carriage to make things even better. My previous design worked great but I found it a little too complicated to put together and to align things. The new Y carriage now has fewer parts, remains expandable (for the future), mostly all aluminum (water jet cut) and is stronger than before without adding much weight. These extra features add up to give you more precision, simplifies assembly and makes everything nice and straight with out even trying! Take a look at the rendering and you'll see how easy it's going to be to put together. So in conclusion... It looks like we might be a little delayed in somethings, but I think when you get your Bukobots you'll understand why we work so hard on the details. We want you to see how cool and easy 3D printing can be. We do strive to make high quality products and want to maintain a good reputation from the start. Thank you all again for your amazing support and patience with this project, I hope you enojoy the pictures! ...The Deezmaker Team P.S. Don't forget to checkout twitter (@deezmaker) and our website (deezmaker.com) for more updates and info. I hope everyone is doing great! I just wanted to announce that the store is open (for now) for those that missed the Kickstarter batch. Store link: <url>"pre-order" one as soon as possible and I can try my best (but no promises!) to add it to the end of the kickstarter rewards batch. Keep in mind, if you don't order soon and I get too many orders, you might miss the chance to get it sooner and you may not get one until possibly November or so. Obviously if you are a backer, you don't need to worry about it, you'll get yours before any pre-orders. Also, you may have noticed the price is a little higher since I wanted my initial backers to get a better deal for having faith in this project in the beginning of course...BUT, if you use the code "KICKSTARTERS" I can give you $50 off any $800+ order. Everything else is moving along great, but it's been super busy. Keychains are almost ready to go out and "plastics only" rewards will also be ready too after some minor design improvements that I wanted to include. On another note, I had the amazing privilege to be invited by Jon Schrieber (from CSC) to an "I.T. Event" for the staff and engineers at NASA's JPL facility in Pasadena to demonstrate my low cost version of a 3D printer, the Bukobot (as they use $20,000+ 3D printers of course). I had such an great time meeting with so many engineers and staff that actually work on the major NASA missions like the rover on Mars, satellites orbiting Saturn and other far out space things. During the event, I printed a bunch of keychains with the JPL logo to give out and even made an iPhone case with the CSC logo. It was just so awesome to be there surrounded by folks that put things in space, it's just hard to describe the feeling! Check out the video and pictures below. Thank you again everyone for your wonderful support! Video from a JPL staff intern: <url>"Makerbot Monthly" meeting. This is open to everyone that is interested in 3D printing and anyone that wants a chance to see the Bukobot in person. Below is the info: <url>"Deezmaker Store" is almost ready (hopefully for next week), so keep an eye out for that. If you know someone that missed the Kickstarter Bukobots (or maybe you want more) I will have a store open soon for "pre-orders" that will be made after the full Kickstarter batch is shipped. Again, thank you all for your amazing support and I really appreciate everyone's enthusiasm for the Bukobot project! ...and I hope everyone has a wonderful Father's Day on Sunday! (Photo below is a picture of me setting up from a previous "Makerbot Monthly" meeting at Crashspace) Oh my gosh! I'm so amazed with all of your support! This was such an incredible experience and it's just the beginning! I'm extremely honored to be able to make all of you the best 3D printer I can and to inspire your 3D printing imaginations!!! A huge thanks to my Dad, my very supporting girlfriend Jyoti, my mom, the folks at Crashspace.org and all of you backers for the wonderful comments, advice and positive support that will make this project a reality!!! Thank you so much!!! I love all you guys! If you haven't got your Bukobot, you have 30 minutes left! Don't be left behind on this first batch! Incredible! $160k+ and most of it came in the last few days! This is unbelievable and I'm so excited that there's so many awesome people out there that want to experience 3D printing with a Bukobot! Again, thank you all for your wonderful comments and support on this Bukobot project! The photo below has the members of Crashspace at the Maker Faire Booth that have helped me tons with this project: Left to right - Theron and his wife, Naim, Me and Rich (the designer of the Wallace Reprap 3D printer). What can I say? Just incredible! In the last few moments of this projects, the pledges have just been pouring in! Thank you so much for everyone's support! Only 12 hours left and still going! If you haven't pledged for your Bukobot yet, don't miss out on the special first batch, time is running out! These prices are special for Kickstarter backers and I can't guarantee they will remain the same when I offer them on my online store. So don't miss this chance to get your Bukobot, or you may have to wait after August 2012 to get one. And don't forget to share this with your friends before it's too late! Thank you all! You guys rock! The Bukobots love you all! P.S. Here's a picture of my Dad, the host of the show, a Bukobot 8 Vanilla and me at the Fresno TV station (Univision 21) for another interview earlier today. I'm starting to almost feel like a 3D printing movie star ; ) I just can't believe it, we passed $100,000! You guys are just so awesome! The Bukobot is going to take off with so much great support thanks to all of you. Great things are going to happen with the Bukobot! The Bukobot was actually IN THE NEWS! On my way back from the Maker Faire, I stopped by Fresno to visit my Mom and I was contacted by the local spanish TV station about doing a little report on 3D printing since I'm originally from Argentina and I speak spanish too. They wanted to show their Hispanic audience how accessible 3D printing is and how education (with a 3D printer) can help realize your dreams. They taped it this morning and it end up airing later that day at about 6pm (they are fast!). I thought they did a wonderful job and it was kind of cool to be on TV : ) Check out the video below (Disclaimer: I recorded this on a TV with my video camera, so sorry about the quality and the clapping by my mom...and it's also in spanish.) Now for some other cool stuff... Many have requested this and I finally got the numbers. If you chose to get a single extruder Bukobot that comes with the X1 controller board and feel that you will want a dual extruder in the future, I can now offer you the X3 controller for $50 more on your pledge. If you already selected a "Duo" model, you will already have the X3, so no need to worry about this. All the single extruder Bukobots will come with the X1 controller (even the Bukito), but if you want me to include the X3 instead, just add $50 to your pledge. The X3 now includes a built-in SD card reader, a cool new cover with all the LED lights and all the extra components to run a dual extruder (extra motor driver, hot-end and thermistor controls). See the picture to see what it looks like, it's really cool! Maker Faire, good times! The Maker Faire was just amazing. I was talking to tons of people about 3D printing, how the Bukobots work, printing out and giving away samples all day. It was so fun hanging out with the other members from Crashspace at the booth and sharing their projects too. I even got to meet one of my backers in person and gave him my octopus 3D print from the "How to print a 3D object" video...@Mike: make sure to keep that famous octopus safe, it might be worth a lot in the future ; ) Check out the video and some pictures from the Maker Faire event. So I hope everyone is excited as I am about the Bukobots becoming a reality! I can't wait to start making your Bukobots and I hope your imagination is already running wild with 3D ideas! Thank you all for your kind and wonderful support! Thank you all for the support! We are getting close to the 200% mark and it's getting very exciting! I'm currently at the Maker Faire this weekend and I've been talking to tons of wonderful people that are ready to get into 3D printing with a Bukobot. I have been printing things out all day at the event, from my Bukobot Fly (which is now #1 on thingiverse.com in popularity!), to Crashspace.org logo coins and iPhone cases. If you are at the Maker Faire, please stop by (booth 107 at the exhibit hall) and I'll give you a 3d print of something cool and show you all the great features of the Bukobots. I want to just share a link of a really cool guy I met at the faire that specializes in PLA filament and gave me some samples to try out during the event. And I have to say, I really like this filament, it was very consistent and there are some cool transparent colors..he even had glow-in-the-dark PLA! so when you get your Bukobot, checkout his PLA online store when it's ready: <url>"Rest in peace my poor Ol' Prusa Mendel" Now for the exciting news: Bukobots at Maker Faire! If anyone is attending the "Maker Faire" in San Mateo I will be there showing my Bukobots! So if you want to see one in person (and maybe I'll print something out for you too), this will be a great chance to see them in action! When you are at the Maker Faire, find the "Crashspace" of LA booth and hopefully I'll get to meet you and you can also check out some other cool things we'll have on display. It looks like we will be at the "Hackerspace Area", but follow my twitter feed ( @deezmaker ) and I'll announce where I will be exactly. I will also try to share when cool things happen during the event through twitter. Cheers! Hope everyone has a great weekend! Hi Everyone! I hope everyone is excited that the Bukobots will become a reality! Things are moving forward very fast now and I've made some cool test to show the printer's quality. I've been asked a lot what the resolution capabilities were of the Bukobots, so I made a little (literally!) test to show it. In theory, I knew the Bukobot can handle it and things always sound great on paper, but I decide to put it to a good test. Most 3D printers work at 0.3mm or 0.25mm and barely do well at 0.1mm, but I pushed my Bukobot 8 Vanilla prototype to 0.05mm. The detail actually amazed me because I thought the plastic wasn't going to be good enough to go that small, but it did and it came out really awesome. All Bukobot models will be able to do these resolutions because the axis travel ratios will all be same. I hope this shows everyone how solid and precise a Bukobot can be. Click on images to download the high-res version Yoda Resolution Test 0.1mm Layers, 7.5cm tall I printed a sculpture and a yoda because they had some nice curves that would show the layers nicely. I printed these on my Bukobot 8 Vanilla prototype using Repetier Host for mac and Slic3r 1.7.2b for the slicing. The nozzle is a Budaschozzle 1.1 with a 0.35mm opening from the awesome guys at Lulzbots.com and my controller board is the Azteeg X1 from Panucatt Devices . Thanks everyone for your support! And don't forget to share this project with your circle of friends! We have passed 100% funding! Thanks to everyone's support, we can now produce the Bukobots and release them into the world for everyone to print cool 3D stuff! But let's not stop there! Please keep bugging your friends and family to spread the word so we can all benefit from a big community of 3d printers! A quick note about the status of this project. My Bukobots are currently perfectly functional and ready for production. I am, however, still refining some aspects of them (like organizing the wiring a little better and fine tuning print settings) to make it the best 3D printer I can deliver to all by backers. Remember, Bukobots are all about quality and simplicity so you can do more 3D printing and less fussing. To excite everyone a little more about the Bukobot, I made a quick little video showing the easy process of printing an object out on a Bukobot printer. This might help everyone get a better feel of how cool and easy it is to print 3D objects and see the Bukobot in action. (Please forgive my acting skills and my workshop , I have been exhausted from working so hard on this project I didn't organize or rehearse for this : ) ...I can assure you the instructional videos that will come later will be better and more entertaining!) For teachers and educators out there, I paid a visit to my old high school and demonstrated 3D printing to several classes. It was really great to see how excited the students were about 3D printing. I have a quick video to show you my awesome electronics teacher (which also teaches wood shop), Mr. Schultz, from my old high school days to explain in his own words the advantages of 3D printing in the classroom. Here's the video of Mr. Schultz: <url>"FAQ" section at the bottom of the project page. Hope this helps clarify some things or give you more insight of the Bukobot project. It flies! The little airplane experiment I started a couple days ago has been going great. I refined the design a few times and made it even thinner for it to be lighter, until I finally got it to fly! I went to the park today to test it out and it glides nicely! I'm not sure about this, but this might be the world's first 3D printable hand glider that flies! This little airplane was more than just an idea, it was a test that really gave me a chance to challenge the quality of the Bukobot and so far it's been amazing. This airplane had very thin layers (0.1mm) and needed to be very precise (for obvious reasons). It seems that I've been able to print even the most challenging 3D objects with little or no adjustments so far. Things are looking great for the Bukobot. Below is the link to thingiverse of where I posted the files and pictures of the "Bukobot Fly" airplane design. <url>
