Hey everyone if you have yet to receive a refund, please message me and I will resolve the issue quickly! Thank you! Hey everyone just dropping you a quick line to let you know that paypal funds are being sent out as I type this. If after 2/21 you still have not received your paypal refund please message me! Furthermore, if you would like to request a paypal refund instead of a check or amazon account refund, please message me right away! Checks are lagging a bit because I had to switch banks, but I will keep you updated on their expected delivery date. Thank you all! ~Joseph Hey ya'll! Just posting a quick update to let you know that, although I had run into some banking delays, I will be sending out the PayPal refunds within 72 hours and the checks within 4-5 days. These are the latest estimates and things will probably move faster than that! Thank you for your continued patience, ~Joseph Hey everyone! I know that all of you have been waiting quite some time for the next update or any word at all from me, and many have grown frustrated and confused and rightfully so. Leaving everyone in the dark and going on a hiatus for months was not something that I had purposefully set out to do, and I know that you all deserve much more than that. Though it is extremely difficult for me to explain what has occurred over these last few months, I agree with every comment that has been made over the last few months; being honest and open is the best way forward. The reason for my temporary hold on the project is because of three extenuating contributing circumstances. First and foremost, I unfortunately had a death in the family. This loss of this person has affected me and changed me in ways I never thought possible. For a long time, getting even daily tasks done was excruciatingly difficult. Though I have grieved, I honestly feel like no reason is good enough to let down the people that put faith in my dreams. I am truly sorry that I failed to speak up sooner about the reasons for my absence. I am also going through a divorce which began in late November. Sparing a lot of personal details, it was an unfortunate event that required a lot of time, resources, energy and eventually I reached a point where my living situation was unsafe. Through everything I have had to rearrange my life so that I could become productive again, and have the time, utilities and space required to work on RAiN. Finally, as a result of the challenges I have faced over the last few months, I have been placed in extreme economic hardship. To meet this challenge I have had to spend a lot of time and energy accumulating resources so that I can have the tools necessary for working on the project and maintaining a healthy life. As it stands, RAiN is now being actively developed again after a hiatus of a few months. Though things have begun to calm down, I am still not in a position to give updates in a frequent and regular time frame. I have not abandoned any of you completely, and I have not given up on fulfilling my promises. I have no right to ask anything of you all, for you have already demonstrated extreme patience and understanding. RAiN is getting there, though slower than it was at first, and I look forward to bringing in some new updates in the near future. If you have any more questions or concerns please respond to this post, and I will do my best to get back to you. From the bottom of my heart I am sorry, and I hope that you will forgive me for not updating or responding to you in the way you deserve. Hello everyone! Hot off the desk of Nobody Studios comes two brand new character concepts for Leo and Lilly! They have been hard at work developing media for our upcoming title, RAiN., and we look forward to providing you with updates as they become available. All concept art will be included in the RAiN. art book featured on this Kickstarter project. Just a reminder, all updates will now be provided through Kickstarter, and I will be closing the blog. Thank you for all your wonderful feedback! The following is an important update that was previously available on the blog: Today I would like to begin by thanking everyone who made the Kickstarter funding for our project a success. Without the help of dedicated gamers like yourselves, this game would not be in production. Help, however, is a two way street and on my end I have been somewhat neglectful in communicating with you all. You guys and gals deserve more than an apology, you deserve open and honest communication about the game you helped to fund; that is why I will be providing weekly updates via Kickstarter. If you find this rather spammy, please unsubscribe from email notifications! Here you will be able to read weekly updates from staff as we move closer to the official beta release. More importantly, you'll be able to interact with us and offer your feedback and suggestions on various aspects of the game's development. Every comment, suggestion and criticism will not only be read, but taken seriously and with respect. For this week, I am going to share with everyone my Kickstarter experience, the platform's strengths and limitations, and in what way it has affected our immediate and long term goals. Additionally, I want to clarify a few misconceptions about development and shed some light into the overall process behind creating a game of this magnitude. We chose Kickstarter because of its security features and it's ability to generate interest in projects seeking funding. On both accounts, the platform proved to be more than successful. There were, however, a few surprises and road bumps that were encountered along the way: -After a project completes, the project creator is barred from making any edits and alterations to the front page of their Kickstarter. Because of this, I have been unable to make key edits that would have helped clarify the post-success confusion. These changes were mostly reflected in our staff structure as Derek Diaz, Wesley Birch and Alexander Panama of Studio Lexi have been unfortunately withdrawn from the project's staff. All further references to the project's staff list will reflect this change. -Once a single person has claimed a reward, it is impossible to change the expected reward date. Shortly after RAiN.'s Kickstarter began, it became clear that it would require additional time to both fulfill rewards and release the game. Though a key edit was made about the release time of the game, I was unable to edit any of the reward expected dates. This security feature of Kickstarter is understandable, but I was not expecting it when editing and learning the platform. I want everyone to know that all rewards will be fulfilled to the best of my ability, in the fastest way possible. At the moment, I do not have an exact expected date for delivery of backer rewards... but I can safely say they will all probably be sent no later than Mid-September, 2013, and will most likely coincide with the release of the game. I realize that you are all excited and eager to get your hands on your rewards and I look forward to meeting your expectations. The beta is being worked on relentlessly, and I can't wait for the coming discussions and blog updates about it in the coming weeks. -Only when a project is successfully funded are funds taken from backer's accounts, many of which failed to authenticate a payment. Even though the project's Kickstarter page reports funding at the $8,097 level, not all of that was received. Working through this has been quite a difficult task for me, but I was able to ensure the most important aspects of the game were funded for development. Much of the initial delay in information was due to this disconnect between perceived funding and actual funding. I promise all of you better, more open communication and a chance to really impact the game's development. I encourage you to make your voice heard! Feel free to post comments or send messages through Kickstarter, I assure you they will all be read and responded to! We are a small team of people with little experience in projects of this size. With this in mind, I ask you all to exercise patience and understanding. We may get there a little delayed, but we will get there... and it will be glorious. Hey everyone! Having read through all of your comments and concerns, I have decided to move the project updates back to Kickstarter! I tried to move the updates off-site because I felt like, with amount of updates I would be issuing out, your emails would be getting flooded with notifications. I based this decision off of previous backer feedback, and thought it was the right way to let you all know what is happening on a regular basis, I was mistaken. In regards to Studio Lexi being dismissed from the team, this was a hard decision and was not made via the blog. Being new to the Kickstarter platform, I felt like all of the help being offered was help we needed, and I made an error in judgement regarding their involvement. I have and will again deeply apologize to Studio Lexi for my lack of foresight. I know that their amazing talent can and will be witnessed through other projects, and I encourage you to seek them out! Additionally, I understand that some of you have concerns and there are plenty of valid reasons why. Sometimes, deadlines can't be met with a studio this small and my lack of formal experience in business communication does not help matters. I am focused on delivering a game, first and foremost, and realize that this is not enough... I must communicate the project's development with you all. To do this, I will be posting weekly updates via Kickstarter, including screenshots and videos, as well as asking for you to weigh in on a few of the elements of RAiN! With time, I am confident that we can both make RAiN the game you envision it to be. Thank you very much for your continued enthusiasm and criticism, you have not been ignored. ~Joseph Hello everyone! Just shooting all of our backers a notice that updates will no longer be posted on this Kickstarter. We will be providing updates on the game's progression and critical information over at our new development blog! Click here to check out the new development blog! We realize many of you may have questions or concerns about the project, and I have tried to respond to them in the first post! Please use it as a means to communicate directly with the dev team now and in the future. Thank you all! ~Gentlemen-Studios Hey everyone! After some delay having funds disbursed to the proper sources, we are happy to finally provide everyone with an update! We have been hard at work bringing everyone the first phase of the beta test, which all of you will have access to by the end of August. This initial phase of testing will include a few hours of gameplay, with the goal of identifying bugs and tuning combat balance. Our site domain has been registered and its pages are in the process of being created and tested! We will have the site live before the beginning of the beta, including with it a way for you to communicate feedback directly to the game developers. Also, a few additional features have been added to the game's concept. Most notable and concrete among these is the addition of voice acting for the game's endings and (possibly) comic/manga style cut-scenes. As we move forward, we promise to be more communicative on the beta's progress and look forward to sharing sprites, animations, maps and more with everyone in the coming weeks. We will also be contacting backers with general delivery estimates and details about rewards! Thank you again for all your continued support, we are here and listening! Feel free to comment with any questions you may have at this point! WOW! Thanks to the amazing support of all of you guys (and gals!), RAiN is being developed with enough production value to make it something truly special. We are extremely grateful to everyone who has contributed to the success of our project, both financially and emotionally, and look forward to bringing you all a playable beta of RAiN! So many of you are probably thinking... what's next? Well for starters, while we wait for the funds to fully clear, we are finally hiring on a little of the help we have been scouting out over the last few months and bringing them up to speed. Additionally, an official website is in the works and will be hosted the moment funds arrive! We will also adding a paypal donation button for those that would like to continue backing our project (all rewards still stand)! Remember, if we raise an additional $2,000, we will be able to expand to the Mac/iOS platform. We will be sure to keep everyone updated through every step of RAiN's development, adding music and graphics periodically. Finally we would love to thank Robert DellaFave, creator of Hiro Fodder for his never ending support and fundraising partnership. With his help, we were able to secure the funds needed to push ourselves to the top of the popularity list during our pivotal final week. We encourage all of you to seriously consider donating to his project! Even a single dollar helps to boost his projects odds of being created, pay it forward! More information about rewards and when they will be sent out will be coming in the next few weeks. Thank you all! ~Joseph Nix Gentlemen Studios WE DID IT! At exactly 12:21 AM this morning, RAiN received enough donations to account for our entire production costs, RAiN is now a reality. All of us here cannot state our gratitude enough, THANK YOU! We look forward to working tirelessly over the coming months to make RAiN a game that goes beyond its concepts and exceeds all of your expections. On a personal level, I want to thank everyone for supporting independent game development. We are at a crossroads in the industry, torn between games made for shareholders and games made for gamers. Each and every single one of you has helped push back the notion that a studio must have millions to make a game and, in the end, this is what I believe will make gaming even better. We have a very special treat for everyone today! We want to welcome Alexander of Studio Lexi to our family here at Gentlemen Studios. Alexander will be composing a portion of the game's soundtrack, capturing the essence of RAiN to build polished immersion. Though the musical tracks are still in development, we would love to share with you a song inspired by the eternal bond shared by Edward and Elizabeth. Click here to listen! From the bottom of all of our hearts, Gentlemen Studios would like to thank you all again for your endless support over this last month. A website will be live within three weeks time and we'll be sure to post an update the moment it is up! Until then, our current stretch goal is $10,000. With these additional funds secured, we will be able to expand to Mac OS and have RAiN available in the app store! We have additional updates planned throughout the week and look forward to sharing them with you all! ~The Entire RAiN Development Team Gentlemen Studios We cannot believe the overwhelming support we have gathered in the last few days, this is truly remarkable! Thanks to all of you, RAiN is on the verge of being fully funded and brought to life for all of you to enjoy. This has been quite an emotional last couple of days for us... this is a childhood dream being fulfilled right before our eyes! With all of our hearts, we thank you! Speaking of emotion... today's story tidbit comes from letters the player finds throughout a certain area. Reading different letters with different characters will influence your character's disposition throughout RAiN's storyline. Story Tidbit My gentle love, Those pompous elites and propagandists parade around town every day now, claiming the war effort a success... I hate them. They have taken the only person in this world that I have ever loved, the one that taught me how to love, and forced him to act as a brute. If this is how our people measure success... I do not wish to be Lacertian! I would forsake all of the comfort and security the empire could muster just to hold your face in my hands once more. All is not well my love... I find it increasing harder to mask my frustrations during inspection and I suspect that they may discover my true feelings. Even your reputation would not be sufficient to hold at bay their wrath should I let myself slip. For the first time since I have been graced with your love, I feel frightened... I don't know what to do without you... Always, ~Your Elizabeth My beloved Edward, You are gone now... snatched away from me by the cold, wretched hands of conflict. Where are you? Do you know of the paths that you follow in this dark, starless night? I awake at every ease without you, startled by the bitter sound of ceaseless rain at my window. As I stare out into the empty stone streets below, I can't help but think that this downpour's very existence is the essence of my heart fleeing... wrapping itself around this doomed world and suffocating any hope that dares squander a breath. Do you still weep my love? Because I have forgotten how. The tears have been replaced with a vacancy in my mind and body that cannot be filled. Though the rain never stops, I am thirsty... and nothing in Ara could fill the empty well that I have become without you. You always said I was the strong one... that you relied on my courage just to get through the day... but you were wrong. There is nothing virtuous or admirable about me. I fear that if I were to endure this torture for one more night, I would cease to be at all. ~Your Elizabeth Further Announcements After much planning, we have pinpointed that the RAiN playable alpha demo will be available to backers by the end of August! Updates will be made on this Kickstarter after it concludes, letting you know when to check your emails. I would also like to give mention to one final Kickstarter project that has been extremely resourceful in assisting our project. Alcarys Complex , by Modest Arcade , is a successfully funded Kickstarter with amazing story driven concepts. The social interaction between characters and the game world are what really make this game stand out. The unconventional storyline basis is one that departs from known RPG cliches in brilliantly deep and well forged way. Rather than simply fighting to defeat evil, players will be pushed to ponder the very notion of violence and conflict. Needless to say, we are highly impressed. Now that it is already funded, I would encourage everyone to look into the game and engage with the developers! RPGs are not made brilliant in a vacuum! We will be bringing you another update in a few days, detailing possible stretch goals for expanding to different platforms and our plans after the conclusion of the Kickstarter. Thank you again from all of us here at Gentlemen Studios! Hello everyone! Just sending a quick update out to confirm that RAiN will offer full PC controller support ! Most common modern models will be fully compatible with the game, and you will be able to customize the button layout. Additionally, we have added two new reward tiers! Backers who pledge $15 can recieve the digital copy of the game and a digital soundtrack! Also, backers who pledge $500 will have an in-game shrine/area dedicated in their honor, along with the other rewards! If you prefer, you can help us design your area to your liking! Finally, I would like to bring to your attention another Kickstarter project with a lot of promise: Do You Remember . The game is a reimagining of classic RPGs like the Mother series, but with a plethora of notable innovations. For starters, there is a fully functional day and night cycle that changes the quests and NPCs that are accessible to the player. The game will also include a crafting system and intricate NPC relationship building. By donating to this project you are not only bringing another great RPG to life, you are also jump-starting a small independent game studio! The commitment and talent of the project's creator, Yui Jegnan, is what inspired me to share this brilliant project with you. We are currently hard at work on the first RAiN beta, which will be made available in the coming months. Until then, expect a new story update tomorrow! ~Joseph Nix Gentlemen Studios Wow! It looks like this project's funding is really coming together! All of us here at Gentlemen Studios can not overstate how grateful we are for all of the support you backers have given us. We have taken the time to talk with some of you individually and are always impressed with how creative and helpful your comments have been. Thank you! The Celestians Among the many races and creatures of Ara there exists the Celestians, a race of pale, human-like people who are said to be the first to inhabit the world. Though their true genesis is unknown, they believe themselves to be the caretakers of the planet and desire above all else to preserve it for future generations. Extremely fatalistic, Celestians harbor the unshakeable belief that their bloodline determines their fate. They abhor traditional power structures, preferring instead a world free of nationality and law. With the coming of the endless rain, many Celestians started developing psychic abilities. Though this new power has helped them push back the enveloping tyranny of humanity, it comes with grim consequences. All Celestians who gain this ability can no longer sleep and become doomed to eventual madness and death. New Lore Object Today's story/lore object directly relates to the last one. This journal is found before a particularly gripping scene, and we decided to share the first few pages of it with you! Keep in mind, the actual diary pages will change depending on how you have developed Leo. In the following example, the player has given Leo not only a very powerful sense of urgency, but a humility and kindness as well. 30, Novard, AR 1824 Waldier used to be so simple before those damned Lacertians came and forced us into their “union”. I remember how our incompetent council folded to them like a house of cards the instant a sword was drawn. Have they no pride?! The Celestian people were not given life to have it ruled and subverted by those heartless bastards! I would have given my life to resisting them that day were it not for Caekyn. My son... starves these days. The rations that soldiers hand out every week are getting smaller, yet they remain well fed. It's as if the very land scowls at their presence, no crops can grow here! What was once endless fields of garden and grain are now cobblestones and sweatshops. I long for the day when I can be reunited with Karista.... We miss you, my love... ~Cetris Arstus 1, Januar, AR 1824 Today I had my first customer in weeks, a young Celestian who called himself Leo. He wanted me to repair his gun that, much to my surprise, was soiled with dried blood. Was he some kind of depraved lunatic? No... his eyes held a gentle kindness that I hadn’t seen since the rain started falling months ago. As Leo spoke quickly and quietly, constantly nursing his wounded left leg, he told me that the Lacertian empire was coming for my son. Apparently he had found his way to the camp a few ides north of town, and something horrible had happened. Though I persisted, he would only tell me that if I were to see Caekyn again, I would have to flee towards the Baragog caves. My son... what have you done? He left far swifter than any I knew could with such an injury, leaving behind enough Lien for me to make it for a few months out on the road. I will repay him, one way or another... But first I must find a way to make it through the southern checkpoint... My son, are you alright? ~Cetris Arstus Hello backers! Today was a great day for RaiN! Our funding is climbing and we have surpassed 50% of our goal! We are extremely excited and working 10-12 hour days on the game engine, fine tuning the fluidity and responsiveness of combat and exploration. In just a few hours, we'll be giving everyone another story element to better enhance your understanding of the world of Ara. I would like to also give personal notice to another Kickstarter project, Hiro Fodder: A Blue Hope . The game is an extremely unique take on the traditional 16-Bit RPG genre and echoes a lot our developer's enthusiasm and vision. The creator, Robert, is in no short supply of creativity and is making a game that both blends old and new ideas. I highly recommend backing his project! By doing so you help pave the way for original games and exceptional storytelling. Thank you again for all your support! ~Joseph Nix Gentlemen Studios Hello Kickstarter! We are very happy to announce that we have reached over 40% of our goal! With over 100 backers and counting, we have been working hard to make RAiN a game that will exceed everyone's expectations. We will be posting a new story tidbit every other day until the conclusion of the Kickstarter. These will take various forms, giving you a unique look at the game world through many different perspectives and methods. Today's piece is from an actual document you can find in the game! You will be able to interact with almost every object in the environment to enrich your understanding of the world of Ara. URGENT LETTER FROM: Department of Lacertian Technology Professor Niklas C. Schreiber Central Authority of the Lacertian Empire TO: Head Communication Officer Waldier Outpost Subjugated Lacertian Territory 19 2, Januar, AR 1824 Waldier Communication Officer, As you were informed before our arrival, our research team has been dispatched to investigate your outpost's recent discovery. As a reminder, Lacertian law requires all recently subjugated territories to honor the requests of Central Authority and its departments. Though we appreciate your compliance with our request, we have identified the following individuals in Waldier as potentially hostile to our operation: Taur Volans (Male, Aged 34, Celestian) Leo Grieve (Male, Aged 28, Celestian) Lilly Horologuim (Female, Aged 26, Celestian) Sagitta Serevit (Female, Aged 42, Torcard) Caekyn Arstus (Male, Aged 15, Celestian) Any information leading to the whereabouts of the above individuals will result in Lien disbursement, as pursuant with Lacertian law. Please note that any attempt to mislead or hinder our efforts to obtain these individuals will provoke military action. Additionally, we are contacting you to inform you of the danger surrounding our research camp, located 19 ides north of your outpost. As your discovery of the Hydrian library suggested, we have found and contained a live Hydra sample. For your safety, under no circumstances are you to allow anyone within 2 ides of our camp perimeter. Any individuals discovered within the forbidden area will be collected and processed in accordance with Lacertian law. Your current and future compliance with Central Authority will increase Waldier's loyalty ranking as well as its ration shipments. May the wisdom of our Lord Judges guide us always, Professor Niklas C. Schreiber, Department of Lacertian Technology Hello Kickstarter! Everyone here at Gentlemen Studios is very excited to bring you this very important update! We have put together a gameplay video that showcases a non-story related boss. These can be found randomly throughout the game world and often involve several paths to victory, with unique rewards depending on how well you execute the battle. Keep in mind, the graphical presentation of the game as well as the sound effects are heavily under revision. We feel this video is still extremely relevant, however, because it shows actual gameplay concepts that are concrete. In the coming days we will be releasing an update explaining the story's setting, giving you an exclusive look into the gripping tale being told in RAiN. We are eager to further spread the word about our project and better explain its elements over the next few weeks! We would like to thank all of our backers for being so supportive! We learn how to better both our Kickstarter campaign and our projects because of you! ~Gentlemen Studios The development team would like to send a resounding "THANK YOU!" to all of our backers thus far! With you're help, we have been able to secure 30% of the costs needed to produce RAiN. Some exciting giveaways will be coming to backers as we progress through the coming weeks. With 21 days to go, we spend every day working at the edge of our seats, eager to make our collective dream come alive. Thank you again, from the bottom of our hearts. ~Gentlemen Studios PS: A sprite for Leo can be found below, showing off the new, higher resolution sprite graphics that you can expect in the game. We are working hard to push sprite resolution even further for the beta and look forward to showcasing them and their additional frames of animation shortly. We really want to allow our backers behind doors to see the progression of the game's development. A rough draft of the art-book/strategy guide will be up along with a gameplay video showcasing a boss fight soon! Added new alpha screens with updated sprites and graphics engine! We are hard at work preparing a gameplay video for everyone and we expect it to be live within the next few days. Until then, the lead developer, Joseph Nix, has decided to give Kickstarter a challenge... If we raise our $7,000 goal by the deadline, Joseph will get the company logo permanently tattooed on his shoulder (his first tat!) Note: The costs will come from our combined personal funds (plus we know an artist, that helps!). Kickstarter will not be funding this extra-credit assignment :) Hello Kickstarter! This is Joseph Nix, lead developer here at Gentlemen Studios! We are very happy to announce that in under 48 hours, we have received 10% of our funding from you, the backers! You guys rock! Because of you, this game is well on its way to being released! Keep up the good work! We felt like the idea behind psychological development, and how you, the player, will affect the storyline was not properly explained in the initial video. So without further delay, lets check out how you will be able to impact the game's storyline. Everything you do changes the way characters act in the storyline, and the way the storyline unfolds. This is at the core of our design philosophy. We believe that RPG stands for ROLE PLAYING GAME, not sit and the observe prepackaged pre-rendered cut-scene. Players will be able to impact the way characters develop and how the storyline is expressed through the following ways: By making decisions, both in dialog and in gameplay. By crafting certain types of equipment. Inspecting items in the game world and item use Completing quests for NPCs, both good and bad. Killing passive, defenseless creatures makes you more ruthless Defending these creatures makes you more heroic and finally A memento is a sentimental object equipped to your character that grants them special, extremely powerful attacks. The mementos you use and how often you use them further influence your characters disposition. All of this will come together to create seamless changes in your characters behavior. If you notice them becoming more aggressive, your behavior and choices will further that tendancy or reverse it. We hope you are all as excited as we are about this important game mechanic. Stay tuned in the coming days for a gameplay video! We look forward to showing everyone how combat and exploration inside dungeons will work! Thank you! What an exciting first day! Thank you to all that have decided to back our project so far! We are working hard to bring you a gameplay video that better explains the gameplay mechanics. If you have any questions until then, feel free to send us a message, we'd love to hear from you! Added new alpha screenshots at the bottom of the page and updated the gameplay explanation! Lowered the cost for the top tier rewards and allowed the backers to create a total of 3 endings!
