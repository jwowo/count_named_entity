Mike Hey everyone, Because of the overwhelming support I am going to offer all of the colors on both sides to everyone at no additional charge. The surveys will go out soon and you will be able to let me know what color you want. Thanks again for all of your support.

Hey Backers, due to many requests I will be offering the bottle opener and the thumb drive as add ons instead of stretch goals. You can now purchase these two accessories immediately. Please stay tuned for new stretch goals soon as well as new options for carbon fiber hybrid colors. After only 3 days we are already 60% Funded, I wanted to thank everyone that has contributed. I have now added two stretch goals. Stretch goal 1 - $10 000.00 will allow me to produce &amp; include a bottle opener accessory with every Key Stak. Stretch goal 2 - $20 000.00 will allow me to include a 8GB USB thumb drive with every Key Stak.
