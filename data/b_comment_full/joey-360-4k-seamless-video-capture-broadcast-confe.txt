This is so sad. ?????????????????????? @Alan Lau, he is not dead, he is enjoying the good life riding around on his boat that I fear we may have bought him. <url>"Post comment: Be respectful and considerate." - It is slowly difficult for me. @Jeff: Is there news? What is the problem to speak to us? L U N A - The World's Smallest 360º Camera [<url>#/] Luna is a 360° camera designed for everyone.

I will wait. I think Jeff Glasse is more happy... So, happy NY everybody. Another high profile KS project - Zano, has gone bust. At least they have the decency to announce it instead of hiding from us. <url>° camera like the Jo, which you originally filed in 2012. <url>° Have you ever missed filming something amazing because it happened out of frame? Never miss a thing when recording in 360° The actioncam360 is designed to work with your favourite action camera without any modifications needed to the camera. Simply place your camera into our special housing and record video as normal then upload the footage to your computer and view in fully interactive 360 ° with the included player. <url>"Mail Order Rule," requires that marketers who solicit buyers to order merchandise through mail or telephone must have a reasonable basis to expect that they can ship ordered merchandise within the time frame they advertise, or, if no time frame is specified, within 30 days. The Rule also requires that, when a seller cannot ship within the promised time, the seller must obtain the buyer’s consent to a delay in shipping or refund payment for the unshipped merchandise.

While waiting for Jo, check out Sphericam 2 (<url>º camera that allows you to capture absolutely everything around you in high resolution without any blind spots. Six cameras work seamlessly together to capture the world around you in stunning 4K resolution. The last update was in April. It is coming to end of June. It is amazing that there appears to be no sense of duty owed to backers who funded this project. Hard work on the project should not be an excuse. Is the project creator alive? Jeff, Need the money back from my pledge for the Jo. Going through my bank to reverse the charge at the moment. I recommend others do this as well to send a message. Dude, you guys should deliver the joint partner product. I pledge the nebo, and I am not getting anything specially the other pledger from nebo kickstarter already got them on the door step. Worst of all, you are not keeping in touch with them. And they are still waiting for your reply!!! I want my money, they are willing to give me the product for the money I've paid to you!!! Refund my money, 8 months and NOTHING. This is a joke. Please immediately cancel my Kickstarter contribution and refund the full amount of my $780 pledge. Non delivery, no updates to me or to many others, hardware already out of date compared to other systems available. Ben Shedd @Sengsouriya Vongmany , thanks for the links. The videos are not bad via the player but they are not particularly ground-breakingly dissimilar, different or better than full motion 360º video output from Bublcam and 360cam. They are more immersive than these. Moreover, 360cam outputs in 4K and 2K modes, according to the project creator. And Bublcam is a true 360º x 360º surround view spherical video camera - you can actually pan 360º in any direction, including skywards and downwards - a distinct limitation of Joey. I found videos <url>’re in the early stages of development. While we encourage creators to communicate regularly through this process, it’s important to remember that each of them will approach this differently. In most cases, this may be the first time that a creator has the responsibility of communicating with a large support community. Still, we expect that creators will make every effort to complete their project as promised and keep backers updated along the way. We also hope that backers will remain understanding as everyone learns through this process. I’ve reached out to this creator and offered our assistance. My goal is to open the lines of communication and encourage them to update more effectively moving forward. You should continue reaching out to them on your end as well. Through this joint effort, we’ll be reminding the creator to check in. Thanks for being a thoughtful backer and member of the Kickstarter community. I hope you hear more from the project creator soon. Best, Willis PLEASE SUPPORT ME WITH YOUR COMMENTS TO KICKSTARTER. Definitely does not appear to be any attempt to deliver the product to backers and no information provided. Well worth reporting to Kickstarter and emailing Jeff directly to request refund. I will write to Kickstarter today about the behaviour of Jeff and his team. The more backers will do the same, the more we might achieve. I must say this is one of the most disappointing project I've ever backed. Jeff Glasse You really have disappointing all of your investors with your lack of communication, then you say you will do better then seem to be ever worse than before. I have seeing some things posted on your twitter and FB page showing some video content and it being used at SXSW. So it seems that things are moving forward but your radio silence is horrible. Your investors should not have to search around the internet and read between the lines to try and have even a clue as to how things are going. Please give us an update. Don't make us troll you on other platforms... Again, no news. Jeff, weren't you supposed to do a better job at communicating with us after the last update ? This is very unprofessional ! Let me help jeff out. Just saw Kogeto FB page post this link. <url>´s best and you are in the middle of a 360° action video. Will it be able to use Jo´s footage for this gadget and it´s apps (Samsung VR is based on Oculus Rift as you might know)? I was wondering about the power supply requirement. Is it the standard 110v or can it be attach to a Film standards, V-mount battery or AB battery? Thanks for the update, Jeff. Really looking forward to March , but I still do not understand why it took you so long to communicate with us. Anyway, now that you have promised to post the latest news regulary eyerybody is happy again. Thank you Jeff! Glad to know where you are in the process and the issues your working out. If they gave us an update here, then I'd be really happy to wait for the jö, instead of getting a refund.. They should report here, not only on Facebook... Heads up guys, I've talk to the Kogeto guys on Facebook. They said it's tentatively next month for the release. � I'd like to have a refund of the full amount pledged... Hi Dean, I rather would like to receive my Jo, but in the end it´s alwys good to have an alternative. Should we backers contact Kickstarter about this? And what´s the best way to do it? Thanks for an answer. Dean, and how long took that other project for getting the money back? Jeff Glasse Last login Dec 31 2014 where are you?...... Considering the amount of time with zero information and getting close to a month past the expected delivery date I am starting to feel it's worth getting in touch with kickstarter directly about this 1. I have had another project go through the same thing and the money was refunded to all backers. Hey Jeff, I have ordered this for a friend, he sent me the money and I placed the order for him. When he asked me when it would ship, I told him that you guys claimed December, though often kickstarters are delayed. I said do not worry though, I have looked at this company, and I really feel like they are trustworthy. I do not mean that a delay of a month is unreasonable, what I do mean is that complete silence from you guys for over a month now is making me regret trusting your company. If their was some sort of update, then I could tell him, but as of now I have no Jo to give him, as well as no idea what is even going on. You made me loose face. Please right your wrongs. Nick Weren't we supposed to get an update on Nov 25 ? The absence of communication from Jeff is disappointing. I noticed Jeff Glasse posted this on twitter dec 8th: "We're hiring android ninjas @kogeto - ping me if you know/are one who wants to make cool things with us." So maybe the software is not ready? Either way it is sad to see Jeff say he would update us on nov 25th still with no update! Can't wait to hear more, and see this thing in my hand! I did saw a notice from somebody who backed previous project of Kogeto which stated the very same, for a very long time.. I hope their on it... Ah, this silence from Kogeto is very very long.... Some news for backers would be useful. I think their absolutly busy on thos Jo's. An update should be cool for us but I have this idea that we'll get them eventually :p So, Are we going to get our Jo's..... I was excited to hear there was an update. But 7 days of anticipation is rough... Looking like this is going to be a significant delay on the expected delivery date I would assume? Hi Jeff, First of all it´s to good to hear that someone is still out there. The dissapointing part is: no news, although you have promised to post some (good or bad). I am very much dissapointed about this and I really think this not the way a responible company should treat it´s customers. It is kind of worrying - this silent zone. Hi Jeff, your backers haven´t heard from you in a while. Any news, good or bad? What is the vertical field of view? What might be its offset from center if any? Does it capture only video? How about pictures? Does it only capture in 4K/13 megapixel? Can I adjust the resolution/recording to save hard drive space? Is there a warranty for being a first time buyer? Feel free to PM me or just post here. Thank you for your time and I look forward to this item. I want one and am willing to back more $$$. I have some questions. Do you have a full table of tech specs for ? What are the weight and dimensions of the device? So the Battery is J Drive? Records for a 172 continuously? Memory Capacity is based on using a USB hard drive stick or external hard drive? How long does it take to fill up 1GB with continuous recording? Is it waterproof? How soon can I get one if I back $850? By Christmas before the upcoming New Year? Sensor - 13 megapixel sensor 30fps 4k HD Vertical Resolution 3840 X 720 Resolution High Speed Wifi Built-in Bluetooth Joey Capture Software Built in Capacitive Touchscreen Capture - Share - Conference Snapdragon 800 quad core processor Store capacity - USB stick or hard drive J Drive - 175 hours continuous recording (battery?) While a flashy exterior would be welcomed, my primary concern is the video quality and performance. I look forward to adding 360 panoramic videos to my collection of family videos through use of Joey. Dear Jeff, The output video looks amazing and the UI design looks great. But I must say, the physical appearance of the device is ..... not the prettiest. The whole thing looks like a blender, and not a contemporary blender, a blender from the 80s. I would strongly suggest you to hire designer a give the device a more modern look. If you think about it, people will be putting this in their conference room, in the middle of the conference table, the physical appearance of such device is very important. You can probably take some design hint from another kickstarter product: ninja sphere. @Creator, I sent you msg few days ago and still no replay. Can you please keep us updated? Do you plan to allow access to the video stream via RTSP (or via other similar and open standards)?
