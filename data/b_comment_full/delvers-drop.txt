8 years today this was funded. Is it possible to have some update as to if this project is still ongoing or has it died? If it is still alive, is it possible to have a post saying look, this is what we had done since 2017 and we have x stuff left to do which is why we are still unable to give a release date Hello, can you send me my humble key ? Will you be listing it on steam anytime soon ? Still hoping for a very good A-RPG ! is this project still alive? Yo guys! Hope you’ve been surviving through 2020. Maybe bad timing, delays are expected given the times, but I wanted to know if things are still happening. Can we expect some footage or new details in the next year or two? Has the game changed a lot? Are you cutting stuff? Some kind of reconnect? I remember moderating the forums until things went quiet and the only posts that popped up were spambots, it’s been sad remembering that as my last real interaction with the project. I loved the art livestreams, the early builds, the excitement of the last hours of the campaign. I just want to know if I’ll play Delver’s Drop or grow old first. 7 years, with nothing to show for it. So last update was three years ago. If the game is still being worked on, and I’m skeptical it is, post some updates - screenshots, gameplay, anything. Otherwise just saying “we’re working on it” for three years with nothing to show is really sketchy. Been a couple months, seeing how’s it going! Hello! Sending some positive vibes. This is what happens with kickstarter sometimes and is to be expected. The fact that Pixelscopic is still replying to comments is a good sign, although a proper update would of course be very nice. Looking forward to however the game turns out, don't give up =). If you're still working on it, a one-paragraph summary update describing what's happened since the last update 3 years ago would make that more believable. Nearly 3 years since the last update. No news about how it's progressing, not a single screenshot to show that something has been done. What a waste of money. Even an update every 3 months showing any kind of progress would have kept me believing that this would eventually be completed and not just a scam. Man what a blast from the past, do you guys have anything to show for the time you've been working on this? This Kickstarter is literally the reason why I will never back another video game project. I want to request a refund because I don't believe this game will every get made, which is extremely disappointing as I was really looking forward to it during the initial campaign, considering LoZ:aLttP is one of my favourite games. Just checking in to see if things are still talked about, since I looked at the website recently. Surprisingly there are more responses here than in most games I have backed that are in development lol I will be interested to see where this ends up, especially w/ all the options today for platforms. Now I wish this would drop on the Switch since it seems like a great platform choice but I’ll be happy to play it the platform I chose to begin with. Hope you are all safe and will be interested to see a sample in the future. .....furreal wth even happened to this game I pledged like 2012...?? Don’t even remember Just dropping in to check out what's up. When I backed it I was a fellow Springpatchian, but realized I've been gone for years. Glad to see you're still on task - even if super delayed. Looking forward to more updates soon. Given that this is already nearly 7 years after the proposed delivery date, I can't see how any of the funds raised in the kickstarter remain available to continue the project unless everyone from pixelscopic is also running day jobs (or simply given up). If you are continuing on the project, please provide proper updates; if you are letting it die off, please start issuing refunds for those that request them - including myself. I backed the 200 tier for the 3" clay model and have yet to receive anything. I would have expected this to be shipped already as the models would already be made years ago... whats the ETA on early access? (why isnt the demo put up as early access with all the new stuff added to it as its done?) whats the ETA on any rewards? Hello I would like to request a refund for backing this project. It has slipped past the initial estimate by almost 7 years, with the last official Update being roughly 2.5 years ago. This silence is enough that I had actually forgotten that I backed this project, until I happened to check my list of backed projects while looking at a different project. This might have been mitigated for me if you had transitioned to an Early Access model in Steam at some point and pushed incremental updates and experiments that way, but as it stands I don't have faith that this project is capable of being completed to spec or in the near future. Guys I have to be honest. I just spent a few minutes reading through all these comments containing refund requests and vocalized disappointment. While it is good you're taking the time to respond to all of these complaints most of this could have been avoided if you just proactively put that energy into regular updates. Games go over when it comes to development. Instead of spending hours and hours responding to every complaint from people here why aren't you just posting weekly dev updates? It just doesn't make any sense. What people need here is closure and you owe them that. You either need to provide regular dev updates, release what you have and let the cards fall where they may in terms of how folks feel about the product or you need to just tell people its not happening. Anything less just feels dishonest. With every passing day you don't update or release anything it only gets harder to salvage any shred of trust from this endeavour. Hello i would like to request a refund for backing this project. I don’t want to discuss this further over email. Just refund me my pledge if you would be so kind. Thank you. Yeah Derick, just hold out another 8 or so years Why does this response sound like an artificial intelligence is just typing out basically the same thing that Splike already wrote? "I think you should begin rebuilding trust" -"We would certainly like to rebuild trust" "by reviving the communication" -"we know that communication is part of the process" "with your kickstarter backers" -"and that backers want to hear from us" "show us that you can deliver on regular updates" -"we can get back into a regular update cycle" Like... could you please just update the Kickstarter? It's such a bad look to keep responding to comments only, and your responses are just telling us nothing new. I invoke my rights under Kickstarter's Terms of Use: <url>"Project Creators are required to fulfill all rewards of their successful fundraising campaigns or refund any Backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill." I demand a full refund for my pledge amount. Pixelscopic, if you're working on the game, what's keeping you from giving us regular kickstarter updates on your progress? Most people who has backed the project has most definitely forgot all about Delver's Drop. I think you should begin rebuilding the trust with your audience, by reviving the communication with your kickstarter backers. It will take time, but once you show us that you can deliver on regular updates, keeping us in the loop, hype for your game will slowly return. This game had so much promise. I met the team behind it at PAX East after backing it and it looked and felt so good. I was so excited about this one and a glimpse at KS after years of inactivity as a backer led me here, wondering if I just never added my steam code for it to my library or what have you... So sad that it lives eternally in limbo. I hope the team is still out there working on other projects as they were all tremendously nice and talented. I think a lot of the frustration felt by other backers (of this and other projects) is that if work continues on it would be great to see updates on the Project via Kickstarter updates- rather than having to go back to very old projects in Kickstarter and reviewing comments to disseminate if there's any progress- perhaps an update quarterly (no more than a few paragraphs) would appease many of the backers who are appreciative of your efforts to date? 1. This game got funded during a time when KS was blowing up, and this game received way too much money for what it is... which is a simple action game with some randomly generated rooms. 2. The team behind it had no idea how to properly budget for time. The KS launched in what... Feb 2013, and the game was expected to be finished in October of the same year? That's 8 months to finish this game, which at the time didn't seem really unreasonable until... 3. You added stretch goals that were going to drastically increase the time it would take to finish the game... I'm not sure you ever even started working on any of that stuff, but I can imagine it just made finishing the project even more daunting 4. Oddly, this game actually had a demo and I played it, and it seemed pretty fun and polished, which is why it boggles my mind that the game never got finished. It already felt really developed, so it seemed like just a matter of adding more content and tweaking a few things here and there but... 5. You ran into issues with your custom coded engine. Nightmare issues that couldn't be easily fixed. Which should have definitely been addressed BEFORE launching a Kickstarter. Get the hardest stuff out of the way and then launch the KS... don't make a super simple prototype and just hope it works out 6. You bled through money and ran out too quickly. This lead to a huge problem... how were you supposed to continue full time development to get the game finished when you could no longer sustain yourself without getting side work? It became impossible. So essentially what happened was... you got in over your head, ran out of money, and now the project is eternally in limbo because you don't have the time or resources to devote to finishing it... and there's also probably a sense that nothing you release will be good enough to compensate for the tremendous amount of time people have been waiting for the game. What I don't understand is how you can keep making lengthy replies to people each month but can't simply toss us an actual KS update? It looks REALLY bad to post monthly updates and then just... disappear for a solid YEAR. It's happened more than once. I just find it super odd. At this point I would just call this a failure and move on with life. I know people will be upset but people are already upset... and backing a kickstarter comes with the risk of not receiving anything. I'm not even mad about getting no game for my money at this point. It happens. You aren't a professional studio with a long history of delivering games... you have no funds... I can't reasonably expect you to finish this game or refund my money. I don't get the people asking for refunds, as if you have any money left after 6+ years to refund them. The entire point of the KS was that you didn't have the money to finish the game. You're right back at that point... so it's not really realistic that you could refund anyone unless it's coming out of your own pocket, which just seems a bit unfair to me. You've suffered enough. We've suffered enough. Just put the game out of it's misery instead of this limbo where you can't admit you've failed. Honestly as a fellow developer this game seems almost ridiculously easy to recreate in Unity or something nowadays with maybe a few months dev time. It's not exactly a massively complicated game. 6+ years to make this shows incompetence at a grand level. Another studio could have made this game from scratch in between the time it's taken you to make an update apologizing for no updates. Just passing by to do the yearly check: seems like the fraud keeps on. You're lucky that Kickstarter just allows to get away with the money without any product being delivered ... No. Hi Shariq, I'm fairly certain Pixelscopic are just grifters! I hate to ask for this, but how do I go about requesting a refund? It has been seven years, my life is nowhere near what it was back then, I have a child with the second on the way so I wouldn't even have time for something like this anymore, so I'd like to get my money back. The last update is from 2 years ago. Post an update every month. It doesn't have to be long. But you have to show that this project isn't dead. Did you guys consider my advice from before? You really ought to start a Discord or something. I actually bought an Ouya and was looking forward to using it as my go to machine for indie games. Unfortunately it came out a bit too late. If only there was as much work on an honest update declaring the project dead as responding to comments. What a waste of a great concept. I'm pretty sure that he was being sarcastic. Nobody ever wanted Ouya. Just stopping by to catch up on all the comments of my favorite failed Kickstarter campaign since that's the most I'm ever going to get out of my $40 pledge. The funniest part is the lack of an update after 2 years, but the ongoing comment replies. Oh well. I'll be back in another year or so to read up, laugh and commiserate with the other abandoned backers here. Can't wait to play this on my OUYA! Give us a roadmap. Tell us what has been happening these past 7 years. As a backer (and for other backers) I don't think that's asking too much at all. If you don't or can't, then I agree with others here that this was poorly managed and our money is as good as gone. Just checking in :) Glad to see things are still alive! I will be waiting in the wings for release :) I wrote that a year ago, it is still true sadly: "Creator will reply to you that : He is sorry. It took much more time than anticipated. They had to rebuild the engine. That it is coming along. He will still : not talk about a timeframe. not show in game screenshot. not show gameplay video. not write a new update. We will still be pretty much in limbo for the year we will get the game, what will finally be in the final version of the game. We will be here in one year writing the same things, and the creator will be answering with his non-answers." Was going through my backer history and I'm glad to see you guys are still hanging in there and working on the game. Have you thought about sending out a simple, straightforward update here on Kickstarter to let everyone know what's going on? No need to get specific (although it would be nice) and it might quell some of the dissatisfaction I'm seeing in the comments while boosting your PR a bit. Sadly this project has caused me to never want to back another game project on kickstarter. It has been almost 7 years with nothing to show for it other than a demo that was released on humble bundle towards the beginning of this project getting funded. Such a disappointment as this game looked so promising. I accepted the truth that this will never be finished. No matter how much you say that you plan to finish it at a certain point it isn't worth it. Even if it miraculously is finished i wont bother playing it. What a waste of $50. So, since the higher level physical rewards are clearly never being delivered, how about refunding at least the difference they all paid. Here to claim the 1000th comment. Here's to a 1000 more! Please just release whatever you have of the game as open source and admit you spent the money on bringing the team's families to the Bahamas, paid off your mortgage, or something. Showing us photos of your brand new Tesla Model X would be better than nothing. Your websites are completely broken and demonstrate you couldn't code yourself out of an OPEN paper bag. There is absolutely no reason why it's 2019 and this 2D game STILL isn't out yet in some form. This project got DOUBLE the "needed" funding for this project and couldn't deliver on time. Stop wasting people's hopes. Look at these other comments offering well wishes and rightfully asking where this project went. I feel bad for that one schmuck who actually poured $200 into this. Well, hopefully you guys could release an update just to say that hi, we are alive and what we have been doing for the past 2 years or so. Since not everyone will be looking at the comments, if they were to just look at the update, it would look as if you guys have abandon ship. It is a fine thing to use personal funds for a labor of love that you do on the side as a hobby while holding another full time job. It is not a fine thing to take $150,745 USD from 4,534 people for a digital product that you have not finished making 6 years after its estimated delivery date. You know this at both a logical and visceral level. You refuse to provide transparency in the form of a plan with dates, and you have spouted years of weasel words in this forum. I wonder if you even have a plan or if you have just been "playing" all these years. If you do have a plan written down, it is clearly the wrong one and you need to print that sucker out and light it on actual fire. Then stop producing assets such as artwork (I know you like to draw but it is not time for that anymore). Any assets that are not finished like a character without all of its frames or animation tweens... just set that aside for now. Look at what you have left that is most complete. Assemble it together as simply as you can and get version 1 released while perhaps being embarrassed by it. Let people laugh at you and take it. Let me tell you guys... Most of your backers are not expecting anything great from you anymore. That expectation and general faith has dwindled these many years. After it is released and the pressure is off and a product delivered, take as long as you like to refine the game in another release. Make it the game you meant it to be on your own time, as a hobby, as a labor of love, while you hold a full time job. wow, i had forgotten about this game and was only looking through my list. Hopefully we will see an update soon to at least explain what is going with the radio silence. Glad to hear that the devs are still actively replying to questions/comments. I value that deeply. I do have to echo an uneasiness about the project, though. Having someone to talk with is AMAZING, but is there any way to prioritize securing an ETA? Again, I'm very impressed/reassured that someone is responding to these posts/comments so quickly and am not trying to come across the wrong way.. just curious and a little concerned about the timeline as well. Guys your backers need a date. I work in software development. At some point you have to mark the product as finished and move it out the door. You can always continue to patch the product after release. Keeping your backers in the dark is not going to be good for your prospects when it comes to making additional games down the road. You guys need to ship the game. Any plans on an actual update? Since the last one was November of 2017? Not complaining. Just nice to know everyone is alive, and that you are still working. It took roughly a year to post an early build (with decent core functionality) after funding was established. It's been 5 years since that build so I have to wonder what 'working hard' means at this point. I know development takes time but all we've seen in the last 5 years are apologies - nearly 1,000 of them to date. Please just send the physical rewards out to those who paid extra and let the rest of us accept the fact that this project failed. I just want to play the thing. I liked it in the early build and it seemed like all that was needed was levels and content. Now it has been years :( Came for an update found that we are still alive all right, guess ill check back in a while again. Stay strong! Woah I just looked at these comments and had assumed this project was dead for a couple of years now. Good luck to you all and stay safe out there. I moved out of Cassville years ago, but I still think about the indie devs down the road haha. Miss hearing from you guys on Twitter on as well! I think you've probably answered enough of these comments that you could almost copy/paste them into an update by the way... While you're at it though, a simple list of what parts of the game are done, what parts aren't, and what you are currently working on would be good and maybe even rough percentages if you are feeling frisky. So I'm guessing the physical rewards are never coming. Any chance for a refund? That's usually a part of a game development cycle, so it's always interesting to know how things happens, and how are they fought. So how is it going ? Glad you didn't abandon the project, but can we have some sort of info about the difficulties you encounter and where you're at. Hey, I was a backer in the beginning. Is there a demo or steam key out at least for us? This game was in kickstarter before I got diagnosed with MS almost 6 years ago. lol. Please be alive Yo! Wanted to check up on this project. Based on recent comments below, looks like ya'll are still chugging away. Great to hear! Though, be nice to see a backer update sent out once every couple of months or so, if you can. Best of luck, really looking forward to seeing all the progress ya'll have made in the future! Estimated delivery Oct 2013 This is dead, right? Not even an alpha (previous comment) since 2014? Admit this is dead and cancel it. Is the v079 from 2014 still the latest early access version? Hey thanks for reading. I have no doubt you guys are still hard at work. I sent you a message re: Discord. :) Hey fellas. I know you're hard at work on the game still, but you really gotta regularly update backers on progress. One update every two months at the very least. You can't allow the project to look abandoned, which it does. Set up a Discord or something. Gotta keep people who have paid money in the loop. Still looking forward to this game. Hope to play it soon. Much love. Hey Pixelscopic folks, anything cool happening lately? I started college when the campaign started and I’ll be graduating this May. Crazy how time goes by. I think about the game every so often and still have my shirt from PAX East back in 2014 I think? It almost feels like this fable that I tell friends about then remember it’s still not released. I await the day I can finally show them what got me excited about the game in the first place. ;) By the by, would you guys ever have any interest in 3D modelers? I’m still totally amateurish but it’s been my aspiration for years to design and animate 3D game characters and I’m slowly getting there. I’ve dabbled a bit with 3D Printing in the past as well if that piques interest at all, maybe I can PM some samples of projects I’ve worked on! If you happen to know any good sites/communities to start looking for work and help in those areas I would be super appreciative! There’s not a whole lot of good game dev connections to make here in NJ. - Chris I backed the $200 NOSTALGIC ERA TIER ● Sculpted 3" Clay Rogue Figurine by Leah Williams (maker of Little Lazies) when can I expect the figure to be sent? I mean its been years and you guys already had them made Happy New year to the whole Team :) Ryan, it would be nice if you would take the time to recap the last year and what you and the other Team Member have worked on so we Backer get an better understanding what might be still missing in the Game or which parts of the Game might be already finished. What you Guys should also consider is maybe getting in Contact with Nintendo since they are usually very Indie Friendly if it comes to Dev Kits. Besides that: Good luck and a great 2019. Take the time you need to finish the Game and keep us more often in the loop on what you Guys are working on even if some things might take longer then you had first expected :D How do I get the game? It's been many years since I've heard an update From the site order page: "Buying through the Humble widget grants you immediate access to PC and Mac versions (and later Linux and Android versions) of the game through the Humble Store. " Humble do not list the game for sale. As a backer, how do I access these builds? What's the best way to follow progress - it's not easy finding updates via comments like this on a (pretty old!) Kickstarter - and it seem's you've abandoned providing Updates via Kickstarter? SO after 5 years or more of nothing but words from this game, heck Ive never even been able to play any of the demos, Im wondering if I can just get a refund. I dont even play console games anymore at this point so waiting any longer for me is moot. What's stopping a 'rough around the edges' alpha build from being released, just so we can see *some* indication of progress? I too don't really expect to see this game ever see the light of day, but now I am curious, if you say you are working on it, what exactly are you working on and how close to do you "think" you are to finishing or maybe even just having another beta/alpha build? I just commented on Asylum which I also backed. It is 5 years now and not even a demo. Delays like this have poisoned the water for me. I do not now back software because once the money is delivered the pace of (any) development drags down to a crawl. I don't expect to receive this game either. You and the others (there are still others?) working on the game must have a job, social life and family maybe, so there must be not much time to work on the game. There must be an extremely slow rate of advancement on the game, just the fact that you won't give us a time frame, a new one, and not even screenshots, even less a video of the game, I think you are still working mostly on the engine. What I think is that in another 5 years from now, you won't be finished. I must confess I like coming back every few months to read about new people on the team and pore over the same excuses given for the last 5 years. I'm sure you had every intention of finishing this game but it's quite obvious the project failed some time ago. @DrZ: you mean you still don’t have your ouya? But yeah I gave up on this game like 3 years ago. So any chance that the physical reward will every be sent? I know the game is being worked on, but is there any chance those of use that pledged higher will ever see when physical rewards? If not, a refund would be appreciated. I'm afraid to say that this is why I won't back indie games on Kickstarter any more. I tend to back board games and video games, and the list of indie video games that haven't yet delivered, several YEARS after being backed, is just embarrassing. The board games list is mostly complete, with delays of a year about the worst I've seen. I really hope this project eventually sees the light of day, but I know that I, for one, don't have any interest in actually playing it any more. Regards. Now that it's been half a decade, and there's still nothing to show. Maybe it's time to throw in the towel, or offer people still paying attention to your little pet project refunds. I feel like your design roadmap was drawn by your kids with crayons, and you just thought it was so wonderful and special that you couldn't NOT do it. Admit defeat, wave that white flag. not via PM, discuss them here, we are all backers. is this project still alive? Creator will reply to you that : He is sorry. It took much more time than anticipated. They had to rebuild the engine. That it is coming along. He will still : not talk about a timeframe. not show in game screenshot. not show gameplay video. not write a new update. We will still be pretty much in limbo for the year we will get the game, what will finaly be in the final version of the game. We will be here in one year writing the same things, and the creator will be answering with his non-answers. After looking through projects that I’ve backed and seeing that a few Devs just failed to deliver and then went radio silent. I respect that you guys have sent out different playable versions and are still responsive in the comments. I would appreciate a few smaller updates either monthly or quarterly as most times when I check on Kickstarter I just look for updates. So I just read two long responses by the Pixelscopic team, describing how the project went off track. Here's the thing - at what point do you decide to cut scope in favor of completing the project? Because that's what experienced game developers do. We realize at some point in the process that some set of features is beyond our abilities, and we CUT those features. Random, Zelda-like dungoens? Cut 'em, and make a few by hand - you could have been finished by now. Roll-your-own game engine? Cut it, in favor of any one of the NUMEROUS robust game engines available off the shelf. If Unreal is goo enough for Cliffy B., it's sure as hell good enough for you guys. Fancy in-game physics? Cut them, in favor of mechanics based on existing, off-the-shelf physics solutions. Again - there are tons of these. Sorry fellas, but if you're still slogging away trying to create some grand masterpiece of design and technology while ignoring the obvious cuts, you've missed the VERY FIRST LESSON of game development - MAKE CUTS SO YOU CAN SHIP. PS: If you don't believe that I know what I'm talking about when it comes to game dev, maybe you should Google my name ;-) I can't wait for my OUYA copy! Thanks for your answers. It's great to see that the game is still being in works October 2013 — RELEASE! for PC, Mac, Linux: The game is 100% complete and (as reasonably as possible) bug free. Since we are one quarter away from 5 years past the predicted release is there an official update? I haven't seen a new alpha since the initial release to backers. The alpha demo was fun but is there a beta? What happened that this game is so far off the timeline? You guys know we backers are somewhat used to getting told that your projects failed? You may safely tell us instead of letting us hope untill every single backer is in his grave 😂 It's gone quiet around this project. There's nothing to report? cant you just send me out the Sculpted 3" Clay Rogue Figurine by Leah Williams (maker of Little Lazies) that you must already got created (I just dont want them to be lost...) Time to update to C++17! :D Delver's Drop is definitely not dead! It's just like a hobby for the developers. Surely you were improving the camera and dungeon generation for like 5 years... hope it's going well, take your time This is dead right? I wonder what'll happen first, my Delver's Drop shirt from back during PAX East wearing out or the game coming out. If it's the former you guys totally owe me another shirt at least. (Because that shirt has been well-loved) ;) I think something that would be great for the community is to offer us something, anything really, as far as content and preview. Most of us at this point that are still active are understanding of long/slow development of complex games, so we're not entirely surprised by a lack of updated demos. BUT! Surely you have something you can show us? If possible small tech demos (like a single room that shows off updated physics) would be cool as well. And even if that's not possible then videos and even game art are highly appreciated. Showing us the progress you've made, rather than vaguely speaking in its direction, is what we really want right now since we are you BACKERS, rather than your customers! Any news on when the next update (either as in kickstarter update, or playable build, or both) might drop? One day it might release. I backed that project when I was in high school. I am now studying at a University :^] As much as I'm disappointed it's not released yet, if it does come out and comes out good, I'll be satisfied. I've seen too many roguelites releasing in the past years that were ok, but not great so here's hoping this one will be in a better shape if it ever releases. I just popped on to catch up on comments and download the latest build... from 2014. I know you ran into problems but bloody hell. ETA on release? I need to update my backer info since I moved about 3 times since backing this project. I can't believe how long it's been... yikes. What the actual fuck is taking you so long? Looking forward to future updates, and to play the game! Hey guys. Release anything. Do notes, please? You guys can rally your team together and get a patch list up at least, right? When is the OUYA release? Do you have a release date set? It's been a while since an update. How're things going guys? "A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad" Shigeru Miyamoto And a game fallen into development hell loses sight of what it wanted to be in the first place and ends up terrible anyway. Hope the game is still going FYI - The pixelscopic forums are throwing a database error. I hadn't seen any activity on there for a while as of the last time I checked, but it seems to be down completely now. Any updates soon? @Pixelscopic I just wanted to say that i, one of many, appreciate that you guys are still trying to make a great game instead of simply dropping it. As long as the game gets released right, i don't care if i have to wait 20 years for it to happen. "A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad" Shigeru Miyamoto 4 years anniversary of initial estimated delivery date (October 2013). So, where are things at currently? Hi guys. I hope the project is still kicking. Could you post a brief update in here if you have the time? It would be appreciated I'm sure. How can you guys survive for 4 years from these few bucks? � Hi there, I'm wondering where I can report this project to Kickstarter? I'll look around some more and figure it out, just seeing if you guys have any insight. Mainly because paying $50 for a pledge 4 years ago is getting... old? Thanks. In a broader sense than release dates, can you give a general idea of progress, something like "X milestones remaining for feature-complete alpha" or "70% feature complete" or what not? I understand not having an exact date, but having a sense of how much there's left to do would be nice (even if the remaining parts are nonlinear and take up more time than other parts) What's your current release target? Anything at all? I get things were hard but operating with no deadlines whatsoever is very dangerous. I would like to request a refund for this game, please advise. Thank you. So... is there an announced release date for this? I backed this project to give my extra copy as a gift to someone who was excited about this game, but I'm not even friends with that person anymore... I'm not holding out high hopes that this will turn into a great game, but even shovelware on Steam beats nothing at all... I want a refund on this. It is three years past the original listed release date. Awesome! There was a recent article with NintendoEverything that the Nintendo Switch development console will only cost 50,000 japanese yen ($500). I felt a port for that device would be more apt than other big video game consoles. The control flexibility of the Nintendo Switch seems perfect for this game. Give a look if you're interested. Cheers. <url>"it'll happen eventually"? Because being an afterthought after major rewrite to your engine, and after four years of indie development isn't really showing Linux users respect. Yes I understand we're a small portion, but we supported you, and we at least deserve an update on what our support has done to bring the game closer to supporting Linux. I hope this comment doesn't come off too snarky, but Linux gamers have been burned a LOT since this game has gone into development. Please don't burn us again. So what's the update as the end of the year has passed? Going on 4 years now since I pledged. Some progress or a refund would be welcome at this point. Is there any news on this? I want a refund on this. It's three years past the original listed release date, and still no game. It's ridiculous. In the mood to play something like Delver's Drop and it occured to me it's been quiet a long time. So while I'm happy to see that there is communication here on the Kickstarter comments I'm not so happy to see that it's been almost 10 months since a KS update, and all the improvements that have been talked about havent even been released for any of us backers to play with. We understand incomplete, but as backers we want to be a part of that. open up a bit, let us play builds, give the community back some ownershp and pride in this game. Honestly, this has gone on too long. It would feel a lot more honest if the game's website wasn't still trying to sell pre-orders, with no news to offer would be buyers since a Feb 2014 blog post!!! It's unfortunate, but this, and a few other smaller titles which have totally stopped any releases or communications have soured me and stopped me backing a lot of projects. I would also like a refund. This is ridiculous. I get that we were backing knowing that the game may not be made, but man 3 years is ridiculous for what this game is. I've lost 100% of my interest. Can i ask for a refund? 3 years man... when can the 25 people who backed the level for the Sculpted 3" Clay Rogue Figurine by Leah Williams expect to get it? What's the status of this game? There's a download via my humble store but is it beta? If this takes any longer I fear another engine rework using C++17! SCNR! I feel like I have to say something here - I'm sorry that the "negativity" on Kickstarter is bothering you guys, but this game was due out in October of '13. I get set backs and delays; I work in software and web dev myself, but if my company put a deadline for three years previous and we still hadn't delivered, customers would be screaming for our heads and we'd have lawyers kicking down our doors. You don't post regular updates (last update was from February for god's sake), you've vastly overpromised and have underdelivered, and while you seem to be okay communicating here under the comments, we still don't have any firm dates or release windows. People gave you guys $150k because of what you guys promised. So when is this game coming out? Is this game coming out? Or are all your backers out their money? At least be honest if that's the case, because this is ridiculous. @Pixelscopic - Thanks for your reply. I can see how posting updates could start to feel like a negative process when you've hit a series of setbacks and delays. Try to keep in mind that while there is a fair bit of negativity on kickstarter, the vast majority of your backers (myself included) want to see you succeed. I hope the team is able to figure out an update schedule that works for you and also keeps us backers in the loop. Best of luck to you all! :) Hey guys, I realize you've been waiting for a big breakthrough in your engine before posting an update, but it's getting a bit ridiculous. I mean the last update is one day away from literally being half a year ago. I'm not posting this to make you feel bad, and I'm really glad you're still working on the game. I'm still eager to play it. I'd just like to be kept in the loop a bit more, ya know? :) Generally speaking a lot of KS projects I've backed have an easier time communicating with their audience if they change to short updates rather than long ones. Even just sending out an update that literally says "Hey, we're still working on a big physics update to the engine. It's taking longer than we'd hoped, but here's what our artists have been working on." followed by a couple pictures would be better than radio silence. Short updates reassure people that the project is still alive, and they're way easier for you to make so they aren't as much of a distraction to development. Just some food for thought. Keep up the good work. The game still looks amazing! :D Is there another location to get information on this project? From the comments it seems like you guys are still active so I was wondering if there is some other portal for information outside of kickstarter. If not it isn't a big deal; things happen. I've figured that about 10 - 20% of kickstarter games I've backed turn into ghost towns for one reason or another. I was just going through my list of "dead kickstarter games" and was surprised to see that you guys don't seem totally dead. Will this come out for 3DS, Wii U or NX? (or rather, are there any plans to release this game on actual gaming devices) Nintendo has recently overhauled the development process and is available to anyone now. (would maybe need a second Kickstarter due to devkit prices, though) Came here expecting to see a lot of disappointed posts from backers but am pleasantly surprised that you are still responding. Thanks a lot for your effort to do this. I hope to see some form of an update maybe just a basic hello we are still alive! thanks! Just wondering what addess you guys have for me since you're sending physical rewards soon. I sent an email a while ago but didn't receive the postcard you said you would send me. Holy cow, forgot about this. I went in big ($300 level.) Are we still going to be getting all the listed physical rewards (art, collector's box, clay figure, etc...). Also don't remember if I ever submitted my "likeness" or item information. Thanks! Did the physical items ever get sent out, the extras to the tiers? If so I never got mine. What should I do? Are there still plans to put this game on steam? If so, I'm curious why you haven't decided to put the game up for sale as early access. Are you guys offering refunds at all? I have yet to play the game it self but I was under the impression that this was released, lest on the humble bundle it looked like it was. Is it still in beta or? Hard to find this game, not on steam or listed on humble bundle, or even a review of this game, all I have seen in alpha previews and lets plays. Glad to see you're still responding. Hope to play a new build soon. Contrary to Rik's comment about losing interest in the game, my tastes have changed in that I'm even MORE excited for this game! Games like The Binding of Isaac, Nuclear Throne, and the soon to be released Enter The Gungeon have solidified my love for the top-down rogue-like. What makes Delver's Drop even more interesting to me is the medieval fantasy aesthetic, which none of those other games have, and which was one of the reasons I backed in the first place. Rather than being dismayed with the lateness of completion, I'm more impressed with your dedication to finish the game despite the long development cycle. Keep up the hard work, and I'll still be here when your done, ready to play a masterpiece of a game that combines elements of all my favorite games. I'm probably in the minority here, as I see a lot of commenters below me getting impatient, but the majority of my Kickstarter pledges on other projects have been fulfilled, so I don't feel ripped off for having pledged on one or two projects that took longer than expected and I'd rather the money I pledged still be of some use to you guys. Dear Pixelscopic, is this project still alive? The latest update was from more than 5 weeks ago, the latest build I see on Humble is of june 2014!!! All I see is a fancy website with big pre-order buttons. It's still coming for Ouya, even though Ouya doesn't exist anymore? The forum seems to be dead as well, the latest reply in the "Info + updates" board is from November 2015. Looking at the "most recent posts on the forum", it seems that there is around 1 post every 2 weeks or so... I find all of this not really convincing that there is a clear vision of where the game is headed and when things are planned along the roadmap. The initial estimated release date was August 2013. Now I understand that ambitions have changed and I already thought back then that it was a very ambitious release date. But okay, things change and you guys adapt, which I actually admire. However, it is now March 2016! That's 2,5 years delay on Delver's Drop. The game has totally lost my interest to be honest with you. What are your plans to make progress on the game and have a solid release? In the december update you write that will be a solid and playable build in early 2016. In my view, next week marks the end of "early 2016" and I'm at this point assuming, there is no build coming over the Eastern weekend. Also you write that have people started to ask for refunds and that you try to talk with them to "alleviate concerns and meet the needs of customers while they wait for the game to be released". But it's 9 months after infamous update #41 where you explain why the game is taking so long. 9 months! In my opinion, stating that a backer asking for a refund is harming the game's quality is very rude. People that have waited 2,5 years on a game that was expected to be finished between February 2013 and August 2013 are not the ones to blame I would say. My last worry is the actual amount of money that you got via the Kickstarter. You got about 150k back in February 2013. With a 3 man team working for 2,5 years this must be running low (more likely it has been spent a long time already), so how do you expect to even finish the game? My feeling right now is that I'm going to await your response to my concerns and make a decision whether or not to ask for a refund based on this. The game to me still looks incredibly fun to play, but I have lost interest because a) the game has been delayed so much and b) my personal taste has also changed the last 2 years, so I'm not really into these type of games anymore. Best wishes, Rik Any updates...? I really appreciate the thoroughness of the updates, but honestly the one question I care about is never answered: what's the schedule on finishing the game? Do you have a set development plan still or is it just ongoing "until it's done"? I really loved the first demo way way back at PAX, and I'm not a player interested in Alpha builds or what we now call "Early Access" titles. Even if your date is, say, Jan 2018 - I'd really prefer to see that at the very beginning of your update emails instead reading 6-10 extremely detailed paragraphs that don't mention the most important milestone of the project. It's disappointing because this was the very first video game project I backed, and it has soured me against supporting other video game projects. Lastly, replying to comments about refunds and release dates on this backer page with directions to direct message the team privately is poor customer service. Backers shouldn't have to do that to get an answer to a very, VERY basic and obvious question. If you're committed to giving refunds, say that. If you want one last chance to change our minds, say that. But dodging the issue and trying to keep it quiet really hurts your credibility as a company. I'm not trying to sound like an idiot, but is there a way to play this game yet? I know development is super hard and if not, it's ok with me, but I'm just wondering if I missed something. I originally asked for a refund back in April, but decided to hang on and wait longer and be patient :). But at this point.. it's 2 years past the promised date so I would like a refund please. @pixelscopic thanks for reply, look forward to it :) hey @pixelscopic thanks for the updates. I think I asked this a year ago but wondered if we'd be able to get a Steam key at any point? It's purely from a super lazy point of view. I run Steam in BP mode and play exclusively from the couch so it'd be great to be able to get all the updates without a m+kb :D Hi all. Thanks for the update, still looking forward to the games completion. Keep slogging at it, it'll come, eventually. :) Wow, I just followed the notice back here, was this really initially for Oct of 2013? Guys, honestly I loved the idea of this game but holding my money for nearly two years is a bit much. Is there a way to push for a refund, I'm sure you'll make it out eventually but wow.. I had no idea you guys were this far behind. Hi, I was just wondering if I could get a refund. I'm going to be honest, I've lost interest in the project over the past few years. Thanks. so when can we expect the physical rewards? I should be getting the below ● Sculpted 3" Clay Rogue Figurine by Leah Williams (maker of Little Lazies) ● Cloth Map of the game world ● (all previous rewards) Hi! I don't remember getting the email with the code. Where should I look? Thanks! for the Update. Are you working on any other projects besides delver's drop? I backed the Double Fine Adventure game also, not disapointed at all Are you guys still planning on an Ouya release? That company is up for sale and the platform has been a major disappointment thus far mostly used for pirating ROMs. Can we all agree that a PS Vita release would be a better use of your time? I backed this 2 years ago at the $30 tier.. are you offering refunds for those of us that don't want to wait any longer? Thanks for the update Good to be in the loop again! And I'm glad everything is on rails, even though you feel like it's not going at break-neck speeds. But slow progress is still progress :) Over the past months I've been thinking about how I will play this game when it's released. As you say, you wish for Delver's Drop to be on the PC and Android (to name a few), so I am very much hoping you will put in Steam Cloud Sync and a way for our game saves to be synced across all platforms. So when I pick my android tablet up, I will be playing the same steam save from my PC. Hope this will be possible and keep up the good work :) I've never minded Kickstarters going over the projected delivery date, because that's the nature of entrepreneurship and independent product development, which is why I come here. I do, however, dislike not seeing any updates over a long period. I've read your other comments and can understand the desire to not want to communicate until you have good news. And I can only speak for myself, not all other backers. But personally I would prefer to see some sort of regular update, even if it's just about some random anecdote that came up while debugging a level or how a bird got into the office. That at least shows a willingness on the part of the developers to engage with the project and with the backers. It would also be great to see an updated release date even if it's super general, like, "within the next 18 months." Then at least I know what the latest word is. It's been very quiet, but at least you're responding here. That's a good sign. I hope everything is well. Soooooo, If you know that communication has been sparse, why not send a short Update to the backers witth an apology, explanation for the delay and a teaser for the next big update? Delays can happen, that is not the problemm. But your PR could REALLY need some work, guys. No updates in over 6 months now... Kind of sad. Also, I never received any of my backer rewards... So, I'm guessing this game is dead. "estimated delivery August 2013". Another Godus-style kickstarter. Disappointing. This is why I don't use kickstarter anymore. Do you guys still work on this? Was looking forward to hear something about "Digital Game Soundtrack ● Digital Concept Art Pack" maybe if not for another update about the state of the game. Hey, 50$ backer here. How is this truckin' along? I haven't heard anything from you guys in quite a while. Heya guys, Happy New Year to all and keep up the good work. It'll be an awesome game for 2015. :) wasn't sure if to post here, but i never realized you had sent some to the things like the post cards and such to the backers. i never got those, its probably too late at this point , but is there anyway i would be able to get them. i backed a 120, hope i didnt miss out on the art book as well Hey guys ! Congratz for the work already done ! I'm a french backer, and a pretty sure it will be a great game ! Even if there is a delay, I keep confidence ! Hey will you be releasing this through steam or do you have a beta version on there. I'm a $30 tier backer and would love to redeem it there so I don't have to worry about updates :) So...almost a month since any word, a year behind schedule, and double your original funding goal. What's going on? Any news on this? is there any news on the IOS version ? Any updates? So I'm having trouble finding a download link for the newest build. Doesn't appear to be in the Early Access forum. Was it sent in an email? Just downloaded the latest from my humble account, it gives me a guy with a key ring and a bunch of cages. Not sure how to unlock them or to play. Thanks for coming down to OzCon! I really enjoyed and appreciated the advice you gave at the game dev panel. I have stopped receiving any updates and have not received my beta key. When I go to the humble page my email address is not on file. Is the game out yet for backers ? Never got any emails about it Hey guys, the game's looking awesome! I'm part of the $15 tier and I was wondering if we get to be part of the alpha or beta. If not, then when is the game set to come out? I'm dying to play it! thanks, cant wait for the full release of the game, i havnt played the recent build but i was enjoying one of the older builds quite a bit. keep up the good work Are any progress updates available on the next alpha? hi everyone, i have not been keeping up with this as well as i should, but have they announced when they are going to ship the items for backers like the t-shirts and such, just wandering Played some of the alpha. Is very good. I kinda feel like you need a click and hold ability so you can kind of slash and keep things back rather than hammering the left mouse button. Even if it did less damage it would be good. You'll probably say that's in the game. I'll keep messing around. keep up the good work Thank you :D Hey Pixelscopic. I'm a $30 backer and been AWOL for a while. I've dug through my emails and can't find anything about how to access the Beta. Am I able to access it or am I being a pleb? Just tried out the game an unfortunately I can't play it. I get motion sickness and the sorta wavy camera, the way it lags behind where the character is then slowly centers back on the character, it just really makes my motion sickness act up in the worst ways. I can't play it for more than 5 minutes without feeling like I need to hurl. So I humbly request you look into adding a camera option so it's static on top of your character the entire time, if at all possible. Otherwise I fear I will have helped fund a cool game without ever being able to play it. Thank you for your time and consideration. Ack, late reply. Will provide more feedback there! Thanks for the reply (: Hi there, I know it's alpha and all but, am I the only one concerned about how sluggish the controls and movement of the character are? The ambience, music and graphics are all pretty great fyi, but are there any plans to tighten the movement? Perhaps not having a slide effect after one has finished moving etc. Will Linux support be coming to the beta? Delver's Drop was greenlit, congrats :D Since they are making Twice the game, having to wait a few more months for more content due to the games success is a given. Honestly the demos are great and it shows that they are not slacking and truly getting the game to be all that we want and would expect. I cant wait to see the final product at the end of the year. good to read that this game is still being released this fall/winter! woot! Don't know if this has been asked but have you gone to Ouya to see if they would match funds for DD? They recently put out and announcement saying they would match investment funds up to $250k. <url>"This application has failed to start because XINPUT1_3.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem" however no matter how many times I re-install, I get the same error. Is this a common occurrence or does the problem lie with my computer? I'm not certain I caught the survey email and responded while the survey was available. I have a digital-only tier, so... Erk? Actually nevermind <url>#rewards No, I meant it was on the actual Steam launcher. Just thought I would share that if you go onto Steam and click learn more about the steam trading cards and then rewards, about a little more than halfway down the page there is a Greenlight Showcase and the game is Delver's Drop! Could this mean something? I'm really starting to dislike steam greenlight. I really don't understand why they can't have an x% of the way there progress bar. I mean, I guess it is probably a little fuzzier than that, but they should at least release number of Yes's once something gets 'lit, so that you have a general idea of how many votes it takes. Releasing no information makes it seem shady, like you're supposed to slip them some money or something. Delver's drop didn't make it through greenlinght in today's batch :( honestly think it deserve's it more than some of the games there. Lawl, no prob, take your time. It's not like I'm having a baby here and need your forums and character art to set it on or else it'll explode. Eagerly awaiting the update! :3 Looking forward to the update!! Are any updates available on the forums? I'm not sure if this has been answered already and I am just unable to find it or not, but for tiers that have exclusive content as well as a second copy of the game, does this second copy have the same content or will it only have open beta access and otherwise be the retail version of the game? Pay pal just gotta make over 20 k in a day now :). Friends told me you did a good job at PAX and that your game indeed plays well. I'm happy to see you guys climbing up the ladder! PS: Good job on improving the plague rat behavior! I thought it worth sharing here, if people are looking for a neat dungeon game: Desktop Dungeons is free beta to play until 31st March. The alpha has been out for a while and is free for ever, also. It's very neat and tide over until Delver's Drop: <url>"pure zelda" reaction comparison to Delver's Drop, which seems incorrect, but obviously going off the title. That might be an area of communication to work with? It seems more roguelike-like to me, that endless drop mode for eg than a zelda rpg-story questing. The black space (rectangles), can the delver fall and die into those, or are they just a barrier to path around the room/dungeon? As said, the gameplay already LOOKS fun and I've not played it. Any more nuggets to share on the story: Will it be text conversation clues and narrative? Bet pax was a great event. Cheers! @Any potential visitors - You can still contribute to this amazing game through paypal at <url>"female" character called Bob the Barbarian or something like that. I just think think it would be neat to have that option even if the only real change might be the name database. Though I'd also think it would be cool to have male/female models. @Blue-demon - They mentioned on their stream that they may put it in because the original idea was that someone would back 5000 then use the share option to get it out to the rest of the community, but at the moment they are not sure. @Pixelscopic I forgot to ask, since we had no $5,000 what exactly are the plans for the Icarian Wings? Can't wait to give the Alpha a try later on. a hearty congratulations.. well done Team Pixelscopic! :) If all else fails, with the main page poster update, you could always post a final stretch goal poster with the grand total in an update after PayPal pledges have closed. Sadly i misread the Update#16 otherwise i wouldve changed my pledge to $25 or smth. @KW I think $2 should be the going price for new characters, perhaps $2.49 & $4.99 for new expansions. And if it's as big or bigger than the campaign, then $6.99. I think those numbers would be reasonable and entice :) That extra puzzle-mode is the cherry on top of, the icing (multiplayer x3 versions) on the cake (delver's drop)!! Update the progress chart to fill in 150k$ stretch goal when you wake up *cracks whip*. ;) Whoops - my credit card details were outdated on amazon payments -_-. Just fixed it - hopefully it all turns out alright! Looking forward to the amazing work from this! Can't wait to see a dev blog/forum/etc! Congrats. :) It hit 150k. Wow kickstarter sure is a awsome crazy system. Now onto the Halls of Lost Sanity! (kudos whoever came up witht hat name). Congratulations! Take your time to celebrate and enjoy your project. Good to hear that the extra class is confirmed! *yawn* Congrats on reaching the goal! *rubs eyes* $150k!! \o/ Woo, party time! I am glad for the puzzle rooms, as it was the one stretch goal I was really interested in beyond 100K (though of course more content is good, I mean come on, people love content, right? $2.50-5.00 per class and $7.50-10.00 per expansion, just saying.) I caught a bit of the stream but was working at school on my finals, so I'm wondering if we'll be able to get a look at the class concepts sometime in the future? I only caught them for a couple minutes, and well pertaining to my previous comment about the potential of cosplay, some of what I saw (the cartographer, musketeer, shaman, ???) looked really intriguing for that purpose. I'm in no hurry, soonest I could do anything would be PAX Prime, but yeah, thinking in general. Thanks! And of course congratulations! I am eager to see what you guys produce, and to help test it! Congrats and can't wait to play the game!!! I would love to get a desktop wallpaper of Delver's Drop to tide me over until the game releases. I think others would want a desktop wallpaper as well! I need one!!! right now my desktop is just plain blue! it needs some delvers drop desktop wallpaper love! Congratulations Pixelscopic! You should hit us up with some regular dev blog videos and concept art and such! I know i'd love to see it all! Congrats, we finally got the 100 rooms!! :)) @David Isaac I think what you mean is it doesn't have as much "content." But these are 2 different companies :/ and it doesn't at all reflect their passion by any means. Although I DO plan to back torment for $75 as opposed to the $50 here lolll. Gratz! Now go sleep, you have lots of work to do :) Congrats, and good night! Congrats all! :D Looking forward to a wonderful future for PixelScopic! :) $150,000! Cha-ching! Congratulations on $150K, Pixelscopic! More than 200% funded! You deserve it! Grats @Pixelscopic! $150,000+ pledged and over 4500 backers. Bravo! Can't wait for the game! Congratulations kickstarter and Pixelscopic!!! We did it! And done. Now the work begins, good luck! WHOOO! Congratulations. But I have, regardless. I will now madly chew my nails for the last 11 minutes as I waffle like a latka I can't belive I backed this at $50 just now. This is very stupid of me. I really shouldn't. This is not worth $30 more to me than Numaria Torment Woot PUZZLE ROOMS! Strange. The amount is dropping. @Faux Thanks for the quick response, though I then noticed it was actually answered all the way at the bottom of the first page though specifically addressing the $50 tier. Cool stuff! Upped my pledge a bit more =D @Kyle Manley: Yep! Someone asked that earlier and I happened to see their reply. Might be too late to ask this, or maybe it has already been answered, don't really have time to look. Do the "All Previous Rewards" include the 2 copy tier, that is, on the $40 tiers and above, do we get the two copies from the $30 tier? Everyone give $5,000 through PayPal at the same time so we all get Icarian Wings! Over 4500 backers and $150,000 raised! Congratulations! Can't wait to get my hands on this game. Here's hoping we push past those last couple of stretch goals with the PayPal donations! Ok guys..... next stretch goal - expansion! Come on 1k per minute xD!! Grats :D Congratulations on 150K Labyrinth Map stretch goal unlock!! I knew we would make it before this KickStarter was over! ^ ^ $150,000!!! How long have you guys been working on this game? I think I heard about it years ago when I was looking for a roguelike, I went to go "like" the facebook page when this campaign started but I found out that I'd already liked it from before. I'm a hipster, liked Delver's Drop before it was cool! Congrats! We broke 150 k woot! You guys are so close to the 150k mark! Congratulations!!! @nin Nice, I'm getting 5 lined up for when we hit 150k. Also, I'd like to say that this is one of the best put together KS I've seen, as far as pitch, and update content, spelling out the game world, and the various features. That really makes the difference in drawing people in! @Richard - I'm already mildly lit, but it's vacation week, so I'll gladly have a few more. :) @ nin Shot? Shot? :) Based on what they said on the stream, the PP will run until after PAX, and surely those folks will generate 2K. But I'd still like to knock it out tonight, just to celebrate! Plus over $500 in paypal last I heard. So only 2.2K! Go "The Huntsman" we need him :). 1.5 hours to make $3,037 we can do it. We are going to make 150K! I can feel it! Wish I could watch the livestream, but at work. -_- $3800! Check those cushions! go go go go go go go go go go go go go... heh, too close <url>#8 Limited Edition Backer Exclusive -- Only available for our LAST week of Kickstarter. from Kingdom Death : Monster Appeared randomly on pledge section Black Friday Launch Special! - The Game – At this level, you’ll receive the Kingdom Death: Monster boxed game!

Apparently paypal isn't cooperating. Has anyone figured a pretty good pre-paid card that'd work in it's place? @Pixelscopic give me a minute, i'm writing something out. @finallyanime soft voice OP @Blue-demon thanks :) means a lot bro. @finallyanime here sir take my like and comment. hint 4th @Pixelscopic maybe some last minute sales can bring people in. i seen other projects like Ouya and Kingdom Death : Monster post last minute pledges. okay. everyone up by 2 or $3 and we're good. And there's 140.. so close..... This'll be the last time I post any links I promise, but upvote this Reddit if you're in the mood! It's at the top of the kickstarter Reddit, but only barely - <url>#/art/Delvers-Drop-Fan-Art-Character-359130704?_sid=52a10b0f $140.000!!! I wouldn't expect paypal to go far over 3-10k. I know we still have 10 hours to go, but I'm also really anxious to see how much paypal donations we get as well. May definitely some more stretch goals! Come on pledges pierce the heavens. Kickstarter's Last Call!! Delver/s Drop: Next 'Indie Zelda' --- <url>"catch-up" which never really works haha. (Legend of Dragoon, Chrono Cross, etc etc) 16.2k more to go for the next goal!!! Is that "100 room labyrinth" really 100 rooms? Or is that more of a title? 67K in 20 hours! GO GO GO GO GO GO! Yeah I'm mildly hyper tonight xD Also, FYI. For distribution you should look at Steam, GOG, Humble Store (they have a cool widget you can have on your site), Amazon, etc. pledges* Do Paypal pledge contribute to the Stretch goals as well? Increased my pledge in the hopes that we make it to the 100 murderous puzzle mode levels! And also because for a brief moment I thought "Icarian Wings" was a reference to Grandia on the saturn, one of my favorite things ever, and for that fleeting moment you guys got SO many temporary brownie points! I was planning to buy this game when it's released. But when I read about Delver's Drop in RPS and saw in KS it almost reach 2 player co-op (about 129800), I knew I want this game right away. Kudos to developer for creating local co-op, it's a rare feature in (pc) game. And, please make it like Tails supporting Sonic. ;-) Along with belief we need action -- tweet..tweet. You know the bird bird bird...the bird is the wo~ ok ill stop BUT seriously, try to do a search for Delver's on Reddit and just start upvoting. We all play a part & we're quite close. If "race the sun" (SWEET KickStarter) could make an almost impossible gain, we can because it's quite possible already :) lets do it! @Pixelscopic-RB, we believe in you! Go for the gold! Other exclamations of support! :D @Pixelscopic now that we are under the 24h mark before the kickstarter ends, can we get an update with details about how each character is different then the other? also including the kickstarter only class. And by stretch goals, I mean Stretch goals that haven't been achieved yet. Will the stretch goals still be worked on as additional patches/DLC post-release? @Pixelscopic Thanks for answering my question the other day. Also congrats on hitting the $130,000 mark. @finallyanime I'm pretty sure we would rather you be alive and well and make it up with reprisal (restitution). You must live with your mistakes and face them not run away from them. Or I guess if you prefer the more traditional way... then maybe I should say you don't deserve to commit seppuku? (Thats a bit harsh) It's official: I'm an idiot lol just checked out th chart before you posted. You guys must hate me by now. it's TOO LATE!!! I MUST COMMIT SEPPUKU. I BRING DISHONOR!!! Ok Whatsbthis about alpha?? I looked and I didn't see anything regarding alpha....lemme check again. I'd love to get access for the website. Definitely good press. Where's this accursed alpha? Can't wait to see us hit another stretch goal! Its a bit of a stretch, but we can make it! By the way, how will updates on progress be posted after the kick-starter has ended? Are there plans to open up a forum or anything of the sort shortly after? @Pixelscopic Thank you for the explanation. Has "true" 2 Delver Co-Op mode been considered for infinite drop mode? (Or whatever the mode Northernlion was playing is called.) I agree that for campaign mode you would have to design everything around two players, but for that simple score attack mode I think it would be fine to just have two people go through it. Yes, it would be easier than with only one person, but that's kind of ok for co-op in my opinion. Especially if the number of item and health drops remains around the same... and if being reckless with physics can bite you (or your friend) in the rear. Maybe a simple boost in the number of mobs if you think some difficulty compensation is needed. PS: Congratz on 130k! :3 If you think the original Legend of Zelda was "awful", you did not grow up in the 80s. Man, seeing this game reminds me of Link to the Past and the similarly designed 2D Zeldas. Original was awful. Sequel was ...let's just act like it never happened. Oracle of Seasons and Ages were OK but incoherent. Link's Awakening was also incoherent. (as in, it's hard to guess what you're supposed to do next) Minish Cap, I had fun but it was forgettable. Four Swords, played it so much! I can't believe Nintendo ditched 2D and went with whatever Phantom Hourglass was supposed to do. I can't stand Spirit Tracks and Phantom Hourglass. They seem like extremely forgettable games and I can't find any entertainment in playing past the first dungeon. ...Er yeah anyway...I'm really happy for this game. i'm glad t know that my calculations were wrong but in a good way. Congartulations on 130K and companion mode unlock! Onwards to the 150K Labyrinth Map unlock! We can do it!! Congratz on 130k! Only 20 k more to go in 29 hours :). Grats on 130k!!!! Keep up the great work guys! Grats on the 130K!!! Your success really made me want to start something of my own! Thanks! Grats on 130k. I think we can make it to 150k at this rate. Love what I have seen so far and I'm looking forward to playing. I do wonder about contributing a name and how it is going to be done. What's the process there? As a side question, if more than one backer submits the same name, would that name only go in one time or would it go in once for each backer? Put another way, if the name pool is 1000 names and 5 people submitted "Foo" does that mean "Foo" gets a 1 in 1000 chance or a 5 in 1000 chance of being the randomly selected name? Not that it matters in the grand scheme, I'm just curious. $600 away from a new goal! Keep pushing! Thanks for being polite about the criticism. I know you guys are trying your hardest to make sure everything works out best for all parties involved. I felt that honesty was needed in place of brevity on my part, even at the expense of sounding curt. Thank you for your consideration. I figured as much, making online mode for a game is a costly and time consuming part of development after all haha. So I take it there will not be online multiplayer and any co-op/competitive multiplayer will be local, correct? Just wondering, I still plan to follow through on my $30 pledge, it'd just be the icing on the cake. Glad to see your KS is doing so well. @Pixelscopic - You guys are amazing! I upped my pledge back to $50! :) You should make this an official announcement then. I would bet a large portion of the community does not know about this and would be upset once their pledges are locked in place. They might not change their minds about their pledge, but it would be a good show of faith to let them know about what's ahead. I think the sharing with friends is probably the best solution to problem, I agree. But I don't think sweeping this issue under the rug is going to warrant them good PR. Honesty and forthrightness is the only way to retain a good relationship with your customers. Pre-order bonuses are bad because they basically tell me "don't buy or game any time later". Think of all the people that find out too late about your game when the kickstarter is already over (or people who don't have credit cards). The exclusive content is a bit of a non-obvious pitfall, so don't worry. The sharing with friends is a good suggestion. @Boo please show us how these flyers look like. Great idea. @Blue-demon: I think there are two controversies surrounding the exclusive content: 1. It's giving some people an extra class, meaning it will change the gameplay and not just the aesthetics based on the idea of $35 DLC in a $15 game. 2. The content is NOT exclusive to kickstarter backers and will be distributed to other players upon release in a somewhat vague manner. I think they really aren't too bad, either way. I do think, however, that not making an official update regarding this issue will come back to bite Pixelscopic. They have 700+ people who may not know that their $50 is not buying them exclusivity. Done AND done! Happy to back this project. Lets hit that 150k. You have some great backers from reading these comments. I'm curious about the multiplayer set-up part, will there be support for keyboard + gamepad, 2 keyboards or just 2 gamepads. I just backed the project. Looks amazing. I can not wait for the final product. Also, I must say the tiers are very generous, thanks so much! FINE! Take my money! A lot of folks have recommended this game and it just looks too darn cute to pass up. @Boo Good luck! @Boo you have a heart of gold, good luck @finallyanime I'm glad about the adding friends part but facebook is the only social website that i use, I'm not a forum person,I don't use Twitter, I don't join larger ammounts of website. Yea i'm not a big fan of facebook eather but its the only place i know that i keep in touch with other people i met from time to time. Only other alternative is skype. @Pixelscopic Please do not worry too much about the kickstarter content, just look at it as a form of pre-ordering like any other game out there. You will also encounter people who will try to persuade you into getting the most free stuff out of you, I'm not trying to make them sound evil but keep in mind that you don't hear people complain much about pre-order bonus content. As Damian Jepson said "my understanding is that we pledge money through Kickstarter to help a project in return receive something exclusive that sets us of from the rest for doing so and getting in early". I made small pamphlets and today I'm going to give them away at the local mall wish me luck guys :D Starting the day strong going into the last 2 days! Now is the time to spread the word if you haven't already! @Damian Jepson I always saw Kickstarter as a way to help people make what they want to make: In Return For Helping Us Make Our Dream Games, We Will Give Certain Incentives. It's not about getting unique content that will only go to the 4-5 thousand of us who fund the project, it's about helping people create stuff we'd like to have. @Damian Jepson I agree with you. Is the game able to be modded or changed in any way? @Damian Jepson I agree for the most part, but for example i was in the hospital a while ago and coincidentally a reallyyyyyy nice kickstarter (Rival Threads) was going on and I didn't have a chance to back them so I kind of was upset about that at the time. But I know we're talking about something different @Blue-demon ....well actually i was asking cuz I wanting to add you to my list...but...yeah...I just want something where I can put interesting people in one list and I can keep up with what kickstarter's they're with instead of bookmarking every ridiculous time. @anthony I think we can do it! I agree with @RocK_M, it's far too soon to give on the 150K stretch goal! The last 2 days are often the biggest and if you do a live-stream it could gain even more traction. I don't quite understand the fuss about the exclusive content, my understanding is that we pledge money through Kickstarter to help a project in return receive something exclusive that sets us of from the rest for doing so and getting in early. If people don't pledge then they aren't entitled to the reward otherwise it makes the point of Kickstarter abit pointless. Giving up at 150k? Defeatist attitude I say! I want that 200K Stretch Goal! Lets get those extras stages and characters folks! xD @finallyanime there is feature for that, like that, this is not a social networking service. I'm gonna campaign so hard for Delver's in these last hours! 100 ROOM PUZZLE ADD-ON HOOOOOO!!! P.S. vote-UP ALL Delver's Drop reddits you can find and comment!!! @Blue-demon I meant like something akin to clicking and just adding someone. not via Facebook...I hate Facebook atm...I've hated fb integration ever since I heard it actually lol. @Faux Shizzle: Oh, I know there's usually a high spike of pledges in the last 48 hours of a kickstarter (backed over 40 of the addictive little buggers so far.. heh), which is why I said there's a slim chance.. it's going to be close either way. I really hope we can make the $150,000 goal, I just upgraded my pledge to $50 because this looks like the best game I have ever seen on Kickstarter. @Koshinator At the current 'linear' rate I suspect we would hit around 135-140k. Though of course there may be an even bigger surge in the last 24 hours.. After all the reminder works at 48 hours. @Ryan Gilmore - That interests me as well. I'm a little puzzled by what "exclusive" means in this particular case. Also, I didn't see any notice of the announcement that all digital KickStarter exclusive items will eventually be distributed to the rest of the community. Is that going to be addressed here at some point soon? We're closing in on the end and I don't think everyone is aware of that situation. <url>— Some Classes and many items will have requirements that must be met before they can be found. update #7 Gods forbid, if circumstances don't work out that the expansions are covered by the kickstarter + paypal, I would totally pay money for them, especially the puzzle rooms. Or even pay money for more classes if a full expansion isn't in the cards. Oh and i want those 100+ puzzle rooms too!!!! @Boo @Pixelscopic I think unlocking classes would be a good idea. Not with ridiculous requirements of course, but doing something substantial to get them except for the exclusive classes perhaps. @everyone did anyone figure out how to add or follow people on here w/out fb? Idk WHY kickstarter did that....seriously. People can even have friends on forums and there's almost no point except it being a list to remind you who you think's cool. Ugh, kickstarter, i love you, but hate you that that lol. Do we have to unlock the classes? Or do we start with all of them? P.s. I think unlocking them will make it a little more exciting. First Kickstarter campaign I back, got here thanks to the Binding of Isaac, hope this game becomes even better than BOI :D Also a few questions/suggestions: -As VacantPsalm asked (quote): 3. If we provide a name that turns out to already be on the list, do we get a redo or is it waisted? -I think you considered a permadeth feature, I think it can improve replayability, giving a more hardcore experience, so that if you get stuck because of not having bombs or something (like you have mentioned below) then you are screwed and you cant trigger that suicide feature. Maybe it could be one of the achievements, for true hardcore gaming experience xP -Please do the labyrinth 100 rooms when possible, want it so badly!! :D I would love to see us hit the co-op stretch goal. It sounds fun! Zomgzors really wanna get that hoodie... but 2 thousand dollars is a bit over the budget lol! Maybe upgrade to the 1k one... super excited about this... cannot wait to have it come to ios Banana peel as an item = win :D As someone was talking about Torment, it's intresting to compare to Delver's Drop. Torment is a game by industry veterans and pretty much a safe bet if you like any previous game based on D&D. Their style of work is already known for years and that's why people pledge. Delver's Drop is a piece by an aspiring studio that has to show what it's capable of. Pixelscopic is judged much harsher because there isn't something like a predecessor of Delver's Drop. Pledges are soley based on how much one likes the idea or on the game's current progress as opposed to Torment which can catch people by its name alone. One pledges money to support the rise of a studio and see what they can pull off. Let's hope that my pre-paid card gets delieverd (kind of difficult to use credit card payment only around here) before your campaign ends, so that I can throw more money at you. ^^ Also some quick questions people asked me ( when I went out agressively promoting your game): -Is your logo a nod to zelda? -The paralax scroll of the walls is nice, did you ever think about adding that to the drop that leads to the next room as well? -Don't-range based classes have an advantage over melee-based ones (especially when it comes to puzzles) -Can you get stuck in story mode? -Can darkness affect monsters? @Pixelscopic: Me too, I'm anxious for the release. So it's good that I can read up on it in anticipation. Updates answered my previous question, haha. Previous question was just answered by the updates, haha. @Blue- demon: Oh thank you, haha. I should read all the updates before asking Q's. ^-^' @Pixelscopic: Yes, that pointed me in the right direction. Thank you very much. Though, still curious, will the ability charge over time, a bit per every kill, or by each room? Dumb question: is there a way to add friends or follow people on here? I see a fb thing...but can you just straight-up follow a profile? Couple people on here who seem pretty cool...well all of you seem pretty cool to be honest I don't know how someone can not back this game. This game is 100% awesome eye-candy and it looks like it plays awesome, And now multiplayer! this team is making gold in style. Gratz on the multiplayer! I said I'd back if you reached this tier. The co-op option would be fairly awesome too, now we have reached this far! So much quality here. I second that! Another live stream is a great idea! Is there another live stream planned before the campaign ends? The last few hours can bring up a tremendous boost if you got something to fire up the hype. @RocK_M only 84K now! ;) Come on folks! we only need 90k in 3 days! Lets get those extra expansions! xD @Sebastian Helton Huntsman — Longbow Templar — Spear DeathDealer — Katana Bard — Instruments Shaman — Whip Cleric — Flail Murkromancer — ??? Update #7 Few Qs about the add a character name thingy. 1: Can it be a first + last if it is within X amount of characters? I know what name I want to use, but just the first name would be a bit too generic. (It's an NPC in a D&D game I run.) 2: Does it have to be original, or could it be a name that is obviously (or unobviously?) from something else? (e.g. Yuna, Sakuya, Samus, Error, Aragorn, or Hercule Poirot.) 3. If we provide a name that turns out to already be on the list, do we get a redo or is it waisted? I wonder if the classes will be like: Magic based Physical based Skill based? Then hybrid with, Magic/skill Skill/physical Physical/magical? And secret class being the balance between all categories? That'd be nice. I hope we'll see some concept art for the other classes sometime soon. I'd say there's ample material for cosplay here. @Pixelscopic Are you guys going to be at comic con? Also congrats on the $115,000 I honestly didn't think it would get this far but I'm super glad it did. :) I just posted a new post/article on Delver's Drop on my site: <url>~ Multi-player stretch goal reached! Congratulations! Very sad panda to see that Ouya buyers won't be able to alpha and beta test in June. Any hopes of reversing stance on this? Apologies if this has been covered already. In keeping with true KS gaming spirit we all crosspledge like crazy on other projects (some more then others...) So feel free to check my topic and decide yourself if others are worthy; <url>#15 for more details. <url>"do you send each backer one code for each supported platform, or do you send backers a code for a single platform they choose?" This isn't a big issue for me, I'm just curious. I'd kinda like to play on my tablet between lectures. @finallyanime Honestly i stoped doing Kickster projects because i was going broke but in a good way since its for a good cause. just look at all the projects i backed(not trying to smack talk or anything like that). Yea i would like a companion of sorts, maybe this summon can lead me to treasure, help me solve hard puzzles, buff my stats or even fight along side me. I just want a more utility class in game since sometimes i know ill be playing the game just to goof off but at the same time have fun while playing. @Blue-demon that'd be pretty epic! Like 3-5 minute long summons! They'd be like semi-rare and rare items :) btw I just wanna add you know your kickstarter is hella successful when more people are pledging for $50 than $25 even though both tiers are amazing lol. I admit, I defected over to the $50 darkside too lol. Instead of Red Lobster a couple times a week, I'll feast my eyes on the artwork lol @Pixelscopic I may have missed something obvious, but I was wondering when and how the character class voting will take place. @Blue-demon I was thinking the same thing :P @Boo Do it, that way we can have more classes. which brings me to a question @ Pixelscopic any chance that we will have an item or class that allows us to summon creatures to aid us in our quest? If one day I win the lottery I'm donating half of it to Pixelscopic. :D @Pixelscopic, this clarifies the subject, thank you. Can someone points me to the update or at URL that describes what are Excluse in-game "kickstarter items" and why there are different packs? Thanks. @Blue-demon I really don't think people would see it like that as they've said online is a hard endeavor. Extra money is logical. I mean look at skullgirls on indiegogo, they're well over 300k for asking for money for DLC. Same idea. I look at it like this: would you rather play this wonderful game by yourself primarily and not pay more than you already have...or play online and pay for an option that probably wouldn't have happened otherwise. Although I do see what you're saying about gold-digging and it is a valid point. I'm sure to some who might have given every last penny they could might feel a bit weird or otherwise. Idk I guess we'll see. I know Pixelscopic is probably getting tired of commenting about it so I don't expect any reply further regarding online, but naturally it's nice to get your cake & eat it...with others loll @Pixelscopic oh i do know that, i been reading your posts. in regards to numerous requests/concerns people have here in the comments and your responses towards it. "we might keep making more content / modes / expansions / etc for the game" this line pretty much answer most of the questions i had or any future questions that i might have. This line was said several times and its understandable. You guys are not some AAA game company who have millions and millions of dollars and people. More features = to serious work that your team has to put in. You also have to think of how people will react to in the open market. When the game gets release and you get constant requests for more stuff put in the game you will come to a point were you have to average more content with budget and honestly not everyone will be satisfied with the end result. This project looks amazing! Can't wait to play it! Just backed another awesome project too, a fantasy multiplayer game <url>"local multiplayer", so everyone will have to be in the same room. In for my copy! Lets see that $115k stretch goal come to fruition. How will multiplayer work? Is it like you host a party and people use your ip n stuff to find it or will you guys host a server for easier access? Also will multiplayer be crossplatform? Hello Pixels!!! Congratulations on this awesome game, Congrats! We are small game studio from Brazil trying the same road as you, a little bumpy road with a beautiful view, so, good vibes from Brazil for you all guys! Go go!!! See ya! I'm really happy to see that funding has started to really increase lately. I was wondering why more people weren't throwing money at this. I guess it just needed more exposure! Something I would LOVE to see would be a map editor. Being able to play the campaign in coop would be something I'd really like. Just a thought. Ross that's how I came by this gem. I had never even heard of Delver's Drop until just recently with ENB's vid and Joystiq proclaiming how Delver's Drop met their goal. I'm excited to see how this turns out. hey, not sure if anyone else has mentioned already but pretty sure a good few backers in the last few days have been sent your way by EpicNameBro on youtube - here's the link! <url>"alive..?" That infernal thing is still like $200 isn't it? Like 250? Idk...if it were $150 I'd think about it. Anyways, it'd be a great platform for DD Hello Pixelscopic, Do you guys plan on being at E3 This year with an early alpha build to display and maybe get a hands on? Wow! You guys are on fire! First stretch goal reached! 150K stretch goal is a definite possibility! I'd LOVE to see this on the 3DS. Mainly because I don't own any other consoles in the list, but STILL. It'd go we'll with my Shiren the Wandered card. Both the 3DS and Vita sound great, actually! This game would rock on a 3DS XL and Vita screen! @Pixelscopic Yeah I just didn't want to post anything cuz I saw someone else do so, but didn't know if they had the greenlight. P.S. yay I bumped up pledge from $25 to $50 :) if you changed your pledge around a couple times, I'm assuming they'll just charge the pledge you're on when it's over and not add them separately right lol Upped to the all Digital pledge. May up it again to get the T-shirt and physical copy before the campaign is done. @Jeritza Goris: That's the stretch goal for 240k or for much later if the game does well. I'd love to see this game on an actual console. Gameplay looks vibrant, clean, and something I could see many people enjoying. Any chance of it going to PSN, Nintendo eShop, or XBLM? Only $120 bucks to the first stretch goal! Anybody know any Linux users? Get the word out to em! I'm just wondering, does backing grant me a copy of the OUYA version? $115K needs to happen! C'mon! I do wish we meet that last stretch goal, but I am quite content with it getting funded and it coming so seemingly quickly. Congrats! Tell your friends guys let's make this game a legend :D I've been pushing this on my gamer friends for the past week or so. I at least wanna make sure you guys hit the 100k mark. New article about your Kickstarter success on Pocketgamer.co.uk! <url>#13. (My head canon was correct, yay!) Question was not pointless though, all classes in both genders? Awesome. I love the art, more of it is always better. :3 Also, for those interested, apparently Northernlion is going to be doing a live show here in a bit with more Delver's Drop. (And some Dark Souls if you want to see that too.) Link: <url>"contribute a class name", I am assuming this is a typo and should be character name as is true in the $40 tier or that will be a lot of classes xD Game is looking awesome :) I have sort of a dumb question: for the $100k stretch goal mark, is this the same class offered from the $50 reward tier w/the "kickstarter only" class or are these 2 unique classes...? Oh and I think we're gonna reach the goal before the end of the day! *chants to self in corner w/Golem voice* "MUST REACH WARRIORS GUILD & COMPANION CONJURED....Muusssstttt reaches itssss" Wow, $1549 to go! So close now! Daaaamn! 73K!! I hope we reach the goal by the end of the day! I agree that getting this out to as many streamers as possible is a good idea. This will likely become the type of game that people will watch as much as they will play (like BoI). And since even in this very limited pre-alpha build the game is very visually appealing, I think it will likely appeal quite a lot to those who watch games. I've got a list of popular streamers that I really think you guys should push your current build out to. I firmly believe that this would give you a final epic push towards the goal. Backed after ENB's video. Beautiful project. Backed after watching Northernlion play. Didn't know about it before, but super excited now! Very excited about getting my hands on this game. Hopefully every backer will have an option to get a steam key when this game gets greenlighted. I also have a question for the developers... When I was looking at the trailer, when the character hits objects and enemies they all seem to slide off giving the game a slippery and floaty feel. Is this intentional? Having this mechanic are you guys going to ensure the physics are going to be as responsive and accurate as possible? Other than that the trailer convinced me to fund this project @ Pixelscopic I do like the game in general, I as an individual liked said features/content more then the others. I do hope most if not all the stretch goals get archived so that the game will come out nice. There's nothing stopping you guys from doing another Kickstarter for some of your stretch goals. They're really good goals! Just want to say, this looks great and I really want to play it... NOW! Here's hoping you get across the line! @Pixelscopic I just found out about the project and as i skimmed through the remaining time in the project details the stretch goals got my attention. The stretch goals are very nice however i find myself liking the 3rd and 4th stretch goals(Warrior's Guild Formed and Companions Conjured) over the first two. I do not mean to sound negative but from the looks of it we might not be able to reach them, is it possible for you guys to set up a poll and have the community itself vote on what we would like first. Btw, I finally put up about half of the kickstarter material and badges to get people to pledge on my site - <url>"odd" time different from the first three, but yeah, the primary reason I mentioned the youtube is because with my site, I have to jump through numerous hoops to share other platforms besides youtube. P.S. Plus, it'd just be waaaayyyyy easier and would be sweet. @finallyanime but to your point, yes... a youtube (higher quality) option would be nice as well... :D @finallyanime i was on justin.tv, and completely missed the individual videos... if you look at the thumbnails below, on this link <url>"gold" or "special" randomized weapons with special effects? Not necessarily rarity tiers (if so that's cool), but your really cool weps you find from time to time like those red boxes in phantasy star online that made your heart jump when you saw it Just wondering cuz I can't imagine a dungeon crawler w/out some epic loot! Btw I just read the gameplay feature and I see weps are visibly reflected, but armor is not. It makes me a sad panda, but still at least something shows :) P.s. I agree Doomspeaker I'm worried a bit about the exclusivity of a whole class. It just irks me to not get the full game just because I don't have enough money now. The possible chance og getting it from other people does not see to reliant either. Anyway I threw in as much as I can for now, because your project looks amazing. You alread got me on board with "top-down rogue" like. Smooth physics and such gorgeous lighting feel like the icingin on the cake. Even moddable... I need to get more people onto this and pledge more. Best of luck with further development! Just curious, does visual appearance change a little or a lot when you equip items??:) P.S. I SINCERELY hope this gets funded like 300% of what you guys need :) so beautiful This game is an updated piece of my childhood. Hope it reaches the goal!! I don't get why more people are not throwing money at this. This looks like such a great game! Thank goodness the budget went well in Feb. Scraped up enough money to move up to double the pledge. Over 50k now, looking good!!! @Quirken @Pixelscopic yeah I don't exactly have enough @ least atm for the $50 thing either. Just as long as I can maybe play it down the road or have to pay...idk. I get the exclusivity, but Id love to try it too & I'd hate to miss out if it's a favorite kind of mine. Definitely keep us updated. Anyways ill definitely be reviewing this like first thing! Ill post the review on my site along w/little updates for everyone to see. Of course not secret stuff, but you know :) This game is RIGHT up my alley and I can't believe I only learned about it now, less than two weeks before the deadline! (so thanks to David Hellman for tweeting his support) You guys should reach out to some major games news sites and see if they'd write a short article. I emailed Kotaku and Venus Patrol about it at least (the former since they'd written an article showing interest past September, and the latter cuz they're smart + stylish). Good luck!!! Grats on 45k. There's always a lull in the middle, so I think we'll be just fine hitting the mark. wow, exactly 45,000 for the past 30 seconds or so, was just waiting for it to tic up again lol I'm trying to spread the word at O'Reilly about this one. Got a lot of friends who enjoy games like this, and already got 1 pledge in. Every bit helps! I really hope this gets funded. I'm looking forward to playing it. @Christopher Campbell.... If you like consoles just make a Home Theater PC, hook up to your TV, and use xbox controllers with steam big picture. Bam, customizable, super powerful console. Great article about you guys on PocketGamers.co.uk ! <url>"variant" class, just my 2 cents on that. so I have noticed there are different in-game item packs for every level. Do you guys have any information on what kind of stuff they will contain, and what the difference are between the tiers. Any news on the iOS distribution yet? If the game were to be accepted on Steam, would you consider add Steam Cloud? That would be really great, and I might even consider pledging a lot more as that is a feature which seems to be missing in many RPG games on steam. Would Kickstarters terms allow the extra class to be a 'timed exclusive' of sorts? As in, everyone else could get it 3-6 months after launch (either free or paid DLC), but Kickstarterers would get it exclusively until then? I reaaaaally want as many classes as possible, but can't afford the $50 tier. Another option would be making the kickstarter-exclusive classes be variants of the existing classes (maybe different skill trees or slightly different weapons). That would fit the Kickstarter descriptions without making people like me feel like we were missing out on something cool. @Pixelscopic I'll just have to take your word for it, since the only option is to not believe what you say and withdraw the pledge. :) My worries come from how the game handles player death. Losing the gear may or may not be a critical issue, but at least the class level is saved, so the game will inevitably become easier as you play it - supposing that increasing class level has only positive consequences. If this promotes any sort of kamikaze-playstyle, where the player can conceivably be in a situation where death doesn't really matter, then it will pop out any tension that the game could create. I think the penalty for player death should be severe, so as to promote a more careful and thoughful approach to combat, penalizing the 'Diablo way of playing'. This of course needs a wide variety of methods that the player can apply to survive in the dungeon. About the Kickstarter-exclusive player class: How about releasing it as a free update after a set amount of time, say 6 or 12 months after the initial release? I upped my pledge I felt you're updates to be superb and I want to see the stretch goals made, kickstarter has definitely given me confidence back video game wise. Keep up the great work guys! This game reminds me a lot of the first Kain game and that intrigues me... The more information you release about the game, the less sure I feel about it. The only games I have kept playing over the decades are Civilization and roguelikes. I was very much hoping for a zelda-esque take on the roguelike concept, be it with physics if you that rocks your boat. I'm mainly worried that the game just isn't challenging enough without resorting to stuff like insta-death traps or tidal waves of monsters. Of course it's hard to judge the exact difficulty level based on the information we have about the game so far, but that's the impression I've been left with. Great Updates ... I hope the Game will be funded :) Very good Ideas for gameplay , level building... The randomization is like the Ancient Cave in Lufia! Go for it Guys :D Awesome artwork and the game looks fantastic. Really hope you reach your funding goal; best of luck. =oD I really like where the game is going and the gameplay aboit the whole thing. I realize that multiplayer/co-op would be difficult to add during initial release but it is something that my friends and I personally would enjoy. I am anxiously awaiting the early release builds to test out the game. Kyle Indep., MO Regarding the character class at the $50/60 range -- is this class ONLY available to backers at this level, or how does it work? That sounds like something that would be interesting to read, and might drum up some extra publicity! I prefer the tiles, since I find it easier to get a handle on what's going on at a glance. I have a friend who swears by the ASCII version. They're really the same thing under the hood. (The tiles version replaces the ascii symbols with fixed-sized tiles). Be prepared to be a bit confused by over-complicated controls; I recommend printing out a cheat sheet. The tiles version also lets you use the mouse for some things. My favorite thing about the game is picking up scrolls/potions with giberish names and having to use them to identify them (until you figure out which one is a scroll of identify). This often means horrible things will happen to you in the early game, likely causing death or worse ;) I'd be really interested in a blog post with the impressions of the Delver's Drop dev team :) I'd really recommend checking out Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup if you have a chance. I think you've got a great thing going with Delver's Drop as it is, but IMO Dungeon Crawl is kind of the game that defines roguelike to me. I definitely see some similar elements here (in particular, the not knowing what your items do before you use them. I really hope there might be items that actually hurt more than they help!), but don't really think of this as quite the same type of game. 51% congratz So you guys are aiming for a real-time Stone Soup, basically? Sounds good to me. It seems strange to me... this seems like the kind of game people see a screenshot and are already sold. I think the press coverage will help a lot! :) I keep checking this every day feeling nervous it might not get backed. This is one of the only things I've backed that I really really wanted to succeed but wasn't totaly sure it would. Maybe I just worry too much though, still has 19 days to go, haha. update look cool 50% and 1100+ backers... congrats! might we see some footage from Vision Con, or something new you may have prepared just for the campaign? :) thanks for your reply maybey something like what you did for the 50$ back but instead all the physical items with a hard cover book? I dont know how expensive that would be though and how relistic that would be can there be add on like for the hard cover book? because it would be a lot simpler for those who want the book but dont realy want to pay120$ On the side note im totaly perpared to pay 120 dollars if i have to you guys are the first I've ever backed! I'm link from the visioncon update :) how do you acsess closed beta? Also is ther going to be a art book ? becuase i would easily buy it for30$ game looks phenomanal 504 for you Congrats 50% funded, with 20 days to go! This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. as of 10:30 PM CST, sitting at 49.73%... not too shabby, hitting 50% with 21 days remaining in the campaign... :) GO GO GO!!! Let's do this~!! Just heard about the project today. Obviously I'm backing you guys! You guys are right on target; easily a third of funds come in during the last week or so. Looks awesome :) Backed :) Congratulations on 1,000 backers! @SommerEngineering They actually talked about that in their interview with TheARPGamer. You can listen to the interview below, but I think they said the focus would be almost entirely underworld/dungeons. <url>| Delver's Drop Interview) <url>"just" underworld / dungeons? :) Best would be (like e.g. Zelda - A Link to the Past) both... ;) I'm hoping it reaches at least 150K so we can get the Labyrinth Map puzzles, but really the 200K goal would be the most awesome with all of the additional classes and zones added! They'll make it for sure but it would be nice to get 125-150k but we really need some big exposure for that. Lets hope the youtube celeb's aren't done tweeting/covering just yet. ok, we're at 44% funding, with 24 days to go... the odds are certainly in your favor of reaching the objective, but obviously, blowing past it would be ideal... ;) media blitzes are in order! how about a new 5-10 minute gameplay session with the most recent client? lets rocket past 1,000 backers and get the second wind of the campaign going... :) Pete:Thanks for the clarification. Ouya does not play all "Android games". The console is based on Android, but just like the Kindle Fire it has its own store with zero access to the Google Play store. It will not play your existing Android games, so buying the Android "version" is not going to give you the Ouya "version" at the same time. I am glad to see at least a verbal commitment that this will happen. I think Are's idea (about pledge levels with 2 copies) is a great one. Will it be possible to reset your accumulated ranks/skills (or start a new character at level 1/or a new profile)? Say you want to start fresh, increase the challenge, or show the game to a new player. Hi again. Still a way to go, but I think you have a good chance. Have you considered additional tiers for multiple (two) copies of the game? Perhaps more backers would up their 15$ pledge if that was a possibility. fine* @Pete Cavenas any game made for the "android" market is already compatible with Ouya so there is no need to make another "Version" for it Will this game require an active internet connection ? you said that there is a number of different classes and that this is molded off of games like zelda it dose a wonderful job capturing that feel. I am however wondering is there a level/rank/skill system in place or is it like Zelda where you just get new items? ether way would be find also is there a way to customize your look? if your going to make it multilayer this would be nice... yes randomcitizenx it dose Doesn't Ouya play android games? In at just the backer level for now. I feel that this game would be perfect on Ouya. I read the comment below about making the game for Ouya, but if you officially commit to Ouya as a stretch goal I will certainly up my pledge! Thanks for responding :) Glad to hear that. Don't worry, I've been spreading the word online and off. Also, you guys seem to be having trouble with my name. There's only one "n" in "Bradson". ^_^ (It's okay, I forgive you.) I like the companion co-op. It reminds me of multi-player in Kirby Superstar (which is one of the greatest games ever created). If you're worried about balancing combat with drop-in second player assistance, you could borrow a page from old arcade games. Specifically, I'm thinking of the TMNT arcade game, which would just add health to the bosses when more than one player was present. Alternately, stuff could just be easier with two people. Isn't that really part of the fun of having a payer two? Knowing that you've got a power play going on as long as they're around. Also, while I'm blatantly cribbing from other games, Legend of Mana had a thing where if you got pwned but your monster familliar stayed up long enough you would recover. I remember having an epic fight with a dragon where I got floored, and then I waited anxiously as my rabbit hopped about evading massive damage with its single hit point. Getting up after the 30-second eternity and being able to finish the fight was incredible. So, some kind of timed revival mechanic is what I'm suggesting I think. I've never once played the "co-star" mode with another person in Mario Galaxy, even though I'm aware of its existence and it could have been an option. I've messed around with it by myself briefly, so I am familiar with what it is, and find it to be nothing more than a gimmick, or a slightly-involved spectator (if you had one person insistent on playing Mario and the other didn't want to just watch, it'd be a slight compromise) I'd just as soon see Delver's Drop not put effort into multiplayer at all than spend time doing this. (I'm not really interested in horde or deathmatch multiplayer, but I imagine those are comparatively easy to make) You could simply restrict the 2nd player from interacting with puzzles, but give them full (or near full) combat ability. If that messes with the combat balance... oh well. It would be better to have an unbalanced but fun co-op mode than a second player who was really a glorified spectator. I don't think this makes it a "cheat" mode as described in your update. If you won't do that, please at least consider some sort of hot-swap capability. I'm envisioning that the "main" player switches if he dies, and the person who had been controlling the summoned creatures now gets 1P position, and the former main-hero now gets to control the summons. In any case, thanks for the response. Will items and loot factor into puzzles and exploring? It's a staple of Zelda-ish series but how would it work with random dungeon generation? Thanks for the update. For Drop-in Co-op Companion Mode, I'd much rather the game difficulty increase correspondingly, rather than having a gimped co-op partner. I don't think playing co-op will be much fun if you don't get equal power between players (look at co-op in Fable 2... the second player was a generic henchmen, and it wasn't fun for player 2). So, I'd propose either it become more difficult. Either enemies have twice the health or damage potential, or players have less health. Or there could be more enemies, etc. There are plenty of ways you can make co-op viable without feeling like a tacked on gimmick. This wouldn't be a cheat mode. Maybe the experience would be somewhat different than playing single-player, but that's a good thing. If you're worried about achievements or something, you can always have it consider a game you co-oped in in a different category. This is one great looking project, congratulations! I wanted to say, I believe this has the potential to be pretty awesome, if only it manages to nail an adequate level of challenge. And by adequate, I actually mean rather high and uncompromising (within reason). Games like Spelunky , The Binding of Isaac or early Zeldas didn't exactly win our hearts by gently holding our hands, right? That said, keep up the good work! I'd love to see steam keys on this. I know that the game has to be greenlit first but I'd hate to see my Kickstarter rewards disappear when I play it on Steam. I'd hate to cancel my pledge if the Steam key doesn't get added in. After reading the second update, the 100 Room Labyrinth Puzzle Mode call my attention, maybe it could be produced as a DLC in the future because is brilliant! Also, I don't know if it is possible but unlock conept art, new costumes, characters or new itmes is a way to push the gamer to replay the game is like capcom does in their games. It's like "Oh, you finished your game, now take this costumes/upgrades and difficulties and play it again!" Joystiq picked up this Kickstarter, which I'm glad for; I'd forgotten about this game. And then I learned you guys were just SW of here. Looking forward to watching this one take shape! 1/3 of the way there! Hopefully knock out the initial goal in the first week and move on to the awesome stretch goals. Jest an idea- maybe setup something on the site where developers (like myself!) can sign up with their email address and name to receive updates on how the API will work and all that with modding of the game? Or receive some sample code to show how it would work? @ Mohammed we are to wild to be contained all shall taste our fury!! ahem I need a drink :P @Ciper: Damn, all these Wildmen everywhere I go :D Hahaha. I really thought the same as well, if we're gonna have different classes, that could enhance the replayability. Damn, I feel like we need to get this funded already! :D @PixelScopic: Could a we get some insider dev info about this game? What engine (if any) is this based on, and will mods be supported (as a stretch goal, or something) ? @ Pixelscopic thanks for the response I'm encouraged by it and cant wait to see what you have in store. The issue i have with a lot of arpgs is that story and setting get treated as an afterthought if they bother with it at all. @ Pixelscopic i'm really interested in the story elements and how classes interact (if any) killing and looting are fun but can get old fast for me borderlands 1 was a good example hardly any rpg in that and to much trash loot. What are your ideas to counter that with your game? Hi all I just backed this project. I'm hoping to help as much as i can. some of my battle brothers from wildman are here so in turn i am here I agree with Steve. Maybe trying to contact well known games websites to promote the game. This has the potential to be a very good game, I think. The only element that I can see as a pitfall would be the difficulty level. You mentioned rogue-like a couple times in the video, does that describe the general difficulty of the game? I think games like these need to be beyond merciless, or the gamers won't respect the experience. Being able to save some cosmetic stuff is ok, if the game is more difficult to master than Nethack. That doesn't prohibit some kind of easy mode that (for example) doesn't record scores to the main scoreboard. Having said that, the difficulty always needs to be reasonable. In every good rogue-like, I die because I played in a stupid manner, not because the game has insta-death lottery around every corner. Even then, the player should regret their last choices and think, "I would have survived, if I had done [this and that] instead". Being able to mod the game is a major point of interest for me. I hope you give enough control to the modder that a game like Link to the Past (with physics) would be possible as a total conversion mod. @Pixelscopic... i realize we have 27 days left in the campaign (which is certainly an ample amount of time), but do you have any plans for any "media coverage", or other efforts which might drive more folks towards the site? Cant wait found this today and instantly backed it! Delver's Drop might be shooting up to Top-Sellers in the iOS store as soon as it launches, Bastion shot-up and still is among Top-Selling video games lists in the AppStore. No thank you. Ouya? This game looks fantastic and deserves more attention for your hard work and dedication! Best Wishes! @Pixelscopic: It's a bit hard to answer since it's been a while I played it. I guess it had to do with beating the "same" stuff over and over. I mean there are different items and bosses and all that, but every room is the same. Every level has the same elements. In any case I didn't feel compelled to play more. From what I gather, you have planned more variety than I saw in BoI, with puzzles, classes and such. Your game also look more action filled and pretty :) What I'm seeing looks great, guys. I just hope you'll manage to create enough content and replay value. The Binding of Isaac, which is a very similar game, was nice too, but it didn't last very long for me. Best wishes. @PixelScopic: Cool :D Thanks for clarifying. Also, you should really look at @Hammerwatch, both games seem similar (although, I'm kinda digging Delver Drop's artstyle). What's the length of the game gonna be like? Any plans on co-op? @Pixelscopic: responded to your message. I applaud you guys for really listening to the fans! I was extremely excited about alpha, and with all of this other information, I just get more and more excited about the project! Fantastic! I've switched to the Digital Deluxe tier which suits me perfectly but as a thank you for listening I've left my pledge at $65 ;) @Pixelscopic: You would need to go through Steam Greenlight, and if the community votes Delver's Drop enough, Valve will "greenlight" the game. I should add *on steam* So when this goes on sale at 20% off for its first week, how will everyone feel? Or when in a month or two it's at 50% off for a weekend? Been waiting for more info for this one! 25 for now, but will most likely up it in the near future. Reminds me of Binding of Isaac with a lot more depth, I'm excited, I hope this gets funded. Looking forward to your next update ;) As far as the exclusive content goes the least controversial way to go is make it backer exclusive for a limited time then released as a paid DLC for everyone else. Was turned onto your KS by a brother of a dev, looks sweet. $15 to you, as that's all I can really do right now. Good luck. Backed. You guys are pretty. I also REALLY like the site you guys made for Delver's Drop! Any chance I can get a site made by you guys like that? It's amazing! Originally $25, now a $41 contribution! Although not sure if I need that postcard... But good luck guys! I can't wait for some early beta access along with all the nice rewards you have to offer! Looks like such an epic game! -Michael I'd like some more information about the KS exclusives - I just hate dev's which offer KS exclusive items which is often just another name for cheat items (which ofcourse is always denied since saying that they are is even worse). - And an exclusive hero? That is even worse and will for sure make me unpledge if that stays the way it is. (currently $1) - Publishers which offer exclusive items when you preorder at X store or site is already horrible and despised by gamers everywhere so why KS dev's continue to do it I don't know... A lot of other KS dev's have resinded their initial idea of exclusive and made it available to all people or only cosmetic or a timed exclusive. I hope you will see the light aswell. -------- On the Ks itself; I hope you will create a few more tiers offering hardcover artbooks, unsigned posters and also create add-ons for those and other items aswell. Finally, A game that references the most underrated and most challenging dungeon crawler ever! Adventures of Lolo. You have my support! Good Luck! Game looks amazing. Wish you all the best @Pixelscopic. I believe that you guys are on the verge of something awesome. Although I'd suggest improving the music just a teeny bot. @Pixelscopic: Also check out Hammerwatch. Also looking forward to that :D Instant pledge! Awesome looking game! Looking forward to playing it and hoping all of the stretch goals are met! just surpassed $10,000... congrats guys!! this campaign is off to a fantastic start... :) I completely agree with Antony. Is there any thoughts to alpha access? Good luck guys. I hope you will consider adding an all digital mega tier. I don't take physical goods because postage to New Zealand is pretty steep. I'm currently pledging $65 for the $60 tier even tho I will be turning down the physical goods and there are still 2 levels of in-game items that I won't get (but would if I could). What a great game you have in the works there. Shame there is not alpha access. Also is this multiplayer? First Day and 1/9 are already in the pot. If it keeps that way the upcoming Days we should hit the Jackpot by the End of next Week :D This game looks excellent. Cannot wait to play it! Really hope we can get some multiplayer co-op in this game. Looking great either way though. I think I saw the game at PAX prime last year. If so, it makes me even happier that I chipped in some cash. I'm blown away with the progress you guys have made on this game! I wish I could throw my next 5 years worth of salary at you guys, but I kinda need to eat and pay lame bills. I've already spread the word on Facebook. I wish you guys all the best! The game's looking great and I can't wait to get it in my hands! <url>
