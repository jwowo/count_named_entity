Hi Backers and Friends, Well the dust has settled from our Kickstarter campaign and we've been quietly and quickly working to deliver the best Bluetooth Weather Station available. A big thanks to all our backers, many of you have backed a few of my projects and I really appreciate the support! You are not only helping build a product, but a platform of products for the future. The 3 products I have in production have many common parts and they each extend the functionality of your favourite phone or tablet beyond the confines of your pocket or backpack. Multiple Bluetooth StormTag s can deliver weather data to you, and share with the crowd. The aClock Bluetooth Alarm Clock extends the function of your calendar and reminders on your mobile device to your bedside - even when you leave your phone in the kitchen to charge. Finally the YuFu Bluetooth pressure sensitive stylus extends the functionality of the iPad for artists and creative professionals. The common thread is Bluetooth LE and the low power data communication it enables. My company is building a great platform which will integrate all of these products and build many more - I have bunch of exciting ideas in store after we ship our 2014 lineup! I can only describe the interest in StormTag as amazing! Large companies from multiple regions are looking at StormTag for climate data collection in fields as diverse as agriculture, insurance, weather, micro climates in galleries and museums and even paint and surface treatment monitoring. Over the past few weeks our electronics engineers have been working on the final designs for our product and it's coming together nicely - the specs of each component have all been nailed down. Firmware is being worked on to communicate with the SDK in our Apps. Waterproofing and Recharging One of the issues we've been working on is completely sealing the enclosure for 100% waterproofing. With user replaceable batteries there is always the danger that a seal isn't quite perfect, we'd hate to see damage to the electronics caused by a moisture leak. To solve this potential problem I've decided to upgrade our product lineup a little and have two rechargeable power supply methods and drop the CR2032 coin cell. You will still have the same long battery life and all of the other features listed on the Kickstarter campaign. We'll ship a small snap on dongle for USB charging which will take around an hour, the battery itself will last a lifetime, since it will only need charging once per year (or two). So all models will now have either USB rechargeable battery or a solar rechargeable battery - you will also be able to USB charge the solar powered StormTag if you need to keep it in the dark. You don't need to make any changes to your order, the rechargeable upgrade will not cost anything for our preorder and Kickstarter backers. I hope you are as excited by this as I am - I think StormTag is going to change the way we analyse weather, and I appreciate your help bringing it to market! :-) Thanks Jon Hi folks, With a couple of days left to run, we are nearly at our first stretch goal milestone. Awesome - thanks so much! :-) If we hit $100,000 your StormTag data will be shared to the web for IFTTT recipes , the data will get to the web via Apps on your phone or a tablet left charging nearby. But we have bigger plans to help get the data to IFTTT , even when you are not around - we will work towards integration with some Bluetooth to WiFi hubs - the first one will be Apple HomeKit . Apple have released HomeKit specs which StormTag will comply with. I'm not totally sure of course, but I suspect Apple TV might eventually support HomeKit. It makes sense that AppleTV works with BTLE devices in the home, and this would mean we can get StormTag data onto the web. To start with, we'll support IFTTT via the Apps on iOS and Android, but I think we'll see more BT to WiFi hubs fairly soon and we'll integrate with the best of these. We have applied for, and recently been approved for MFi - so StormTag will be built to comply with HomeKit. We will still need to pass the product approval process . Here is a Macworld article which explains HomeKit. I'm also looking at a few other hub devices so IFTTT can work without a phone or tablet nearby. Thanks for your fantastic support - please share with your friends and help us hit the stretch goals! Cheers Jon Hi Backers and Friends, Last week I asked what you would all like as stretch goals for the StormTag and I received an awesome response - thanks very much to everyone who made suggestions. Stretch goals are features that will become available to ALL backers if we hit the $ milestones below in the next 14 days. StormTag Stretch Goals: 1. IFTTT at $100,000, IFTTT allows for recipes, such as "if the temperature reaches X* send an tweet" or "if humidity gets to X send an email". Check it out here: <url>"stick on" mount for StormTag at $125,000, 3. Windows Phone SDK Support at $150,000. Please share the StormTag link with friends and followers and help us hit these stretch goals - Thanks for your support! The extra engineering required for some of the requests would mean a rework and extra cost that is outside of our budget - but since solar power was so popular in suggestions, I have decided to offer a third version of StormTag: StormTag PRO: StormTag Pro includes all of the Stormtag+ goals, plus a solar cell and energy harvesting circuitry, it means that you will never need to change the battery - just add some sunlight every week or so. I've also upgraded the memory to take advantage of the virtually unlimited life - so StormTag PRO will be capable of 2 years data logging. StormTag Pro will also be a totally sealed waterproof unit. The New StormTag Pro rewards can be found here - hit the "Manage Your Pledge" button if you want the upgraded StormTag PRO. Thanks Jon Hi All, I've been thinking about what we can offer if we hit a couple of stretch goals, and I have some ideas - but I'd like to hear what you want. A stretch goal is a feature that will be added to the product if we hit a financial milestone - so for example if we hit $100,000, I will add a new feature and everybody gets that upgrade, If we then hit $150,000 then another upgrade is added. So please hit the main comments page and let me know what you want - is it a new sensor you crave? A software feature? Windows Phone support? Solar power? A wall mounting kit? Or something else? Tell me in the main comments page and I will decide after the weekend! Thanks to everyone for your ongoing support! :-) Jon Hi Backers and Friends, Thanks very much for your support over the past 2 weeks, it's been quite a ride! StormTag has been featured all over the world in many many online articles and it's certainly helped us hit our goal - in fact 338% so far with 4 weeks to run still. I'm interested to hear where you plan to use StormTag - so please take a minute to comment below, it will help me make sure our product fits your needs. Of course it's also very interesting to hear new ideas and use cases that I may not have considered. StormTag is the only 100% waterproof weather sensor and has over a year of data logging - so you can use it for long term outdoor tracking of weather , but of course with our SDK developers will be able to add other functions... Monitor crops and livestock outdoors Monitor warehouse conditions Monitor cold food delivery Monitor food and grain storage conditions Please tell me where you will use StormTag below! Firstly a huge thank you to our awesome backers, StormTag is 50% funded in less than 24 hours. I've had a lot of requests for additional features, after some late night analysis and brainstorming, I have decided to release StormTag+ with the following additional capability: Up to 10 days data logging. Weather data is stored in onboard memory when your phone or tablet is not connected to StormTag+. Humidity Sensor: to provide more accurate forecasting and more complete data collection. UV sensor: StormTag+ will now know if it is outside and provide even more valuable data. StormTag+ will deliver even more accurate data that many people have been asking for. Please consider upgrading your pledge, for a few dollars extra we'll be able to deliver even better data for you - StormTag+ is a very advanced weather station for your keyring! Thanks for your awesome support :-) Jon
