You are all allowed to be angry, I understand this clearly. I have been myself in the same situation and hated it myself, so again I am DEEPLY sorry. I was hospitalized with an internal infection, which kept me out of contact with anyone but my family, and at that time my only concern was to get back on my feet. I'm still fighting this off, but it isn't as serious now due to a minor operation, so I'm continuing to work on the fulfilling the project. The decks should arrive at the port soon, so I will soon have these in my hands! I don't ask you for forgiveness, but to be patient with me. I hope all is well! I'm still on track and have everything sorted. Cards have been finalised and waiting for a reply on when printing has started. Coin designs have been accepted and in the process of being made, I probably won't hear back until after new year. They seem to take forever to respond after I paid. Dice are up in the air between 2 companies, waiting for samples to arrive. I am very sorry for the lack of posts, I have been all over the place, keeping on top of things and pushing for a smooth run. Stay safe this New Year's Eve, don't drink and drive :) Hi backers! I have had a few requests for a possible White coin to fit with the Black and White theme, which makes sense! If we reach Â£10k (have faith!), I'll hand out 1x free "White Coin" to every backer. These will also be available for an add-on as well, when or if the time comes :) It's very early to say if we'll make it even that far, but I have a strong feeling for this project this time around. Spread the word! :)
