Hello Our current sculptors, Eric and Soto, have cast hard wax version soft the casteline models and from them have created masters which have been sent to Asia for production. It has been decided that we should use a company that does this all of the time, rather than have a part-time person committed to the company- esp. since the company will only be producing enough resin figures to satisfy KS. Once we have the samples in-hand and approved, we will have a date for delivery provided to us by the manufacturer. After all minis are delivered, and reviewed by this community, if anyone wishes a refund, refunds will be provided as company revenue allows. In no instance do we want people to be stuck with paying for something that is not to their taste. And, we acknowledge and respect that our taste is not the taste of everyone. In no instance will the company cease business until all KS pledgers are satisfied one way or the other. If anyone chooses to upgrade from resin minis (which we assume are being used for gaming on tabletops) to metal and/or fine metal minis, credit can be applied and the change in reward will be made. Exactly which minis will be available in metals will be posted on the adwgames.com site later this month, again under the auspices and direction of our two primary sculptors, who will be handling fulfillment and satisfaction moving forward. Soto T. has joined the team to finish off the remaining sculpts. The above are 99% finished, only requiring some small wax adjustments before masters are cast. The Watchdog is a statute-sized monster that may or may not animate depending on how you play your games, or decorate your hobby areas. The remaining sculpts will be up next week, then we go to production. And, yes, as some of you have already posted elsewhere, our new sculptor did come from 20 years at Disney, this may be reflected in the approach and aesthetics. Hello. This is Susan Taylor. I am handling fulfillment of this KS Campaign moving froward. This Update is to inform you that as of last week, there has been a change in management for ADWGAMES, and subsequently, this Campaign. We will have a significant Update of miniature photos posted on Oct. 10, 2014, comprising, close to 100% of the miniatures and stretch goals for the Campaign. Shortly thereafter, we will begin production and delivery. Thank you for your patience. <email> I think I can finish all of the furniture tomorrow and have it all finished and detailed by Wednesday. The Grid is 1" square Battery died on camera. Two shots. Will Update, again, tomorrow. Now things go fast. All armatures are complete. We are all detailing, all the time, until completion. Turtles: For turtles you can choose a single Epic Snapper Turtle or two Large Snapping Turtles. We are making one regular large and one Alligator Snapping Turtle. The photo is for size reference. Were-Sharks: We are giving away three were-sharks to everyone on this KS. In three different poses. They are approx 28mm high. Wax: All skin texture, shell textures, claws and final detailing for the above figures will be accomplished at the wax level later this week. I will do once a week updates through KS. The rest of the updates can be tracked here: <url>" square. Keeping in mind that these are giant versions of actual mushrooms, and I think most will be used for cover or ornament. I assume this basic size ratio to the 1x1" is appropriate to your needs? Let me know. This is a sculpy blocking. Details will be finished in wax. Lars will sculpt the turtles and the Kelpie either tomorrow morning or Friday, so everyone can comment and we can make adjustments if there is a consensus. Thank you All for your interest in Sea Monsters. All sculpts will be compete before October, so keep looking for Updates! At the request of ~50 Pledgers, the cost-to-produce prices will be kept in place throughout September, for those seeking multiples- so you can decide what you want as the sculpts are revealed. This will apply to add-ons and multiples only. So, if you love the mushrooms or furniture and want another set at cost-to-produce, or if you purchased four sea monsters and want another four, this would apply to you. Thanks! Free Kelpie for everyone at $4,000 Two free Snapping Turtles for everyone at $4,500 Lars will sculpt the Kelpie tomorrow, if we make the goal, and the Turtles on Wednesday, if we make that goal So, no waiting. We are hitting all goals, so we need new freebies. How about free snapping turtles for $4.5K? Open to all ideas for 20 minutes. New Add-Ons have been added any of the Ice Age Mammals and a Polypus. We are waiting to hear from everyone on the SeaBear or the LobsterMan. Or just a set of Trilobites and a mean Nautilus? Let me know what you want to add to the stretch goals. O.K. We hit the funding goal. We all have crabs coming our way. Now, the fun part. I am around all night to build stretch goals with you. Let me hear from you re: what you want, and if I think we can sell enough after the KS is over to not lose money, I will had it sculpted and cast for you. Let me know! If we reach our goal of $2,500, we will give everyone who has Pledged three free giant Crab minis. You know everyone wants free crabs, tell your friends where they can get them. :) Clarification between the New $15 Pledge and the Old $30 Mushroom Pledge: New $15 Pledge= 10 pieces of normal furniture (one of each); 10 pieces of broken furniture (one of each); 10 mushrooms/fungus (one of each) and one sea monster, big or small. The ref art for the furniture? www.adwgames.com/furniture.jpg Old $30 Mushroom Pledge= 10 pieces of normal furniture (ability to mix and match); 10 pieces of broken furniture (ability to mix and match); 20 mushrooms/fungus (ability to mix and match), 10 stalagmites (see WIP photo, which is pre-wax detailing) and one big sea monster or two small sea monsters. What is we actually hit the $2500? Tell me what you want as a stretch goal freebie this weekend and we will open it up to a vote. I can take on 2 minis for every 200$ above the $2500. So, let's start with two suggestions and I will add those to the stretch goals this afternoon. We believe that once you get your minis the word-of-mouth will more than pay for our freebies here. Read the updates, or email me at <email> if you have any questions. "What if I hate the sculpts?" We are running a 100% money-back satisfaction guaranteed program with this one because the sculpts will be completed by October 1, 2014, i.e., after the end of the KS. If you get minis you do not like. Send them back and we will refund you money, no questions asked. That being said, Lars is running the production moving forward and will be on top of the new sculptors to provide frequent updates. And, as per request, Lars will be available on comments everyday and via email everyday until miniatures are in your hands. Good Morning: It is Saturday the 6th. I am around all day to answer questions and take sculpt requests. If we actually make the goal, I can certainly add a few stretch goal freebies. Let's open the table and hear what you want if we hit the $2500 mark. The link to the " before" reference art <url>"whole" version. We will have "smashed" version as well. So; 10 whole pieces and 10 smashed pieces for everyone. Hello All: I realize during this time of transition in our Company - wherein we are changing sculptors and production methods- we have not been very attentive to this Campaign. We apologize. We will be giving everyone who has Pledged, more than a single $, a single set of mushroom terrain and a single sea monster of your choice- in either Epic size (20-40') or Monster size (6-9') free of charge in October. We will keep the KS running so we can run the survey upon completion and know where to send your freebies. We are on schedule to deliver all of the minis in mid-October, btw. So, if you have Pledged. Never fear. We are on track, just swamped with internal changes at the end of the summer. All the Best, Lars Hello All, Lars, here: I am writing to inform you that all terrain will be designed in Houdini and 3D Studio Max to ensure fidelity, quality and offer options for whole furniture and furniture that "breaks" apart. Models will be 3D printed on an EnvisionTEC wax printer and cast by our team. Fungus, mushrooms, stalagmites and 4 new fungus people will also follow the same pipeline. Those designs will be up next week so we have a good assortment of WYSIWYG add-ons with two weeks to go. Best Lars
