After a successful Full-Color Hologram Kit launch on Kickstarter years ago, LitiHolo is doing another first-ever hologram Kickstarter launch -- The First Desktop 3D Hologram Printer . We reached our funding goal in 25 minutes! &nbsp;And we were also chosen as a Kickstarter "Project We Love" on the first day. &nbsp;It has been exciting! Thank you for your support of our Full-Color Hologram Kit in the past, and we would love your support on our 3D Hologram Printer as well, as we take our next steps in developing the future of hologram technology. - Paul Founder LitiHolo www.litiholo.com Dear Kickstarter Heroes, The Litiholo Full-Color Hologram Kit is finally officially here. This has been a long process, but it has turned out far better as a result. We now have a great source for the green and blue lasers, adding to the reliable holographic-quality red lasers that have made our regular Hologram Kit so successful. In addition, we designed a new color combining optical path for the full-color reflection hologram set-up that is very effective, but keeps the hologram-making process simple, even for full-color holograms. And last but not least, we've added a full step-by-step Owner's Manual for making both transmission and reflection full-color holograms. To see a new video of the full-color holograms from Litiholo, take a look at this link: www.litiholo.com/hologram_kits_color.html The Full-Color Hologram Kit has everything you need to make your own full-color holograms for $329. That includes Red, Green, and Blue holograpic-quality laser systems, high-quality color combining optics, and our full-color sensitive Litiholo "Instant Hologram" Film (20 plates). If you already have our standard Hologram Kit, you can upgrade to making full-color holograms with our Full-Color Hologram Upgrade Kit for $229. Thank you for being part of the hologram community. I think you are going to really enjoy making your own full-color holograms. - Paul www.litiholo.com Finally! Finally! The full-color hologram project that started here as a successfully funded Kickstarter project has been launched to everyone else. The Full-Color Hologram Upgrade Kit is now available to be delivered before Christmas! We know you've been waiting for it, and it's finally here. Together with your basic Litiholo Hologram Kit, this upgrade adds green and blue hologram-quality lasers to make holograms in color. Color holograms have never been done before in an affordable, easy to use kit. Now you can get it for Christmas by going to www.litiholo.com/hologram_kits_color.html. The Full-Color Hologram Upgrade Kit is $229. For this first introduction, we only have a limited quantity of 100 upgrades, so pre-orders are first come first serve. Litiholo just celebrated our 10th birthday since the first Hologram Kit, and we couldn't be prouder to introduce the ground-breaking Full-Color Hologram Upgrade Kit to show how far we've come. You'll also notice a new Hologram Kit design and a new website as part of our 10 year celebration of making holograms "instantly". And I want to thank our Kickstarter backers for making full-color holograms available to everyone. - Paul One year ago on this day, our Kickstarter backers gave us permission to do what had never been done before -- make a full-color hologram kit. What a privilege! The road has been long and difficult, with big breakthroughs as well as grinding moments of waiting and uncertainty. As of today, we are officially 82% shipped, which is amazing and exciting, except for those 18% still waiting and longing for their chance to make color holograms. Thank you, all of you, and especially those still waiting, for your patience. We are so close, and we won't stop until the finish line! - Paul (I wanted to share an e-mail from one of our Kickstarter backers who has been making some cool holograms with his full-color hologram kit. Below is the original e-mail and some nice pictures. - Paul) Date: Fri, 3 May To: Paul Christie Subject: Fantastic Work on the Full-Color Hologram Kit Paul, I finally found some time the past two days to work with the Full-Color Hologram Kit. I have to say that you did a fantastic job on this product! It was well worth the wait. As a Kickstarter I am really pleased! Today I made three holograms, the first one from your bottle caps. Then I decided to make one for each of my two granddaughters, Kayla and Chels. For these, I used some small color wooden letter beads that I purchased from Target. Each hologram spells out their names along with some wooden shapes. These beads work VERY WELL for making holograms. I have attached a picture showing the original and hologram for each. (The holograms actually look MUCH better that my PICTURES of the holograms.) The picture also shows the complete letter bead kit. It is product #1313 Wooden Letter Beads (MelissaAndDoug.com). Hope that you like the idea. Best regards, RB We are just over the hump and have reached the midway point in our shipping! It's been a hard, slow battle to get here, but hopefully the downhill side will go easier... and faster. For those of you who are still anxiously waiting for your full-color hologram kit, thank you so much for your patience. My plan is to be shipping at least 10-15 full-color kits per week from here on out until the end of the backer list is reached, so you will be making full-color holograms in the very near future. For those of you who have received your full-color hologram kits already, please feel free to post your hologram pictures here on Kickstarter under the main "Comments" section. This will give your fellow backers some insight into what you are doing with the kit, and inspire new ideas as well. For anyone who missed the Kickstarter project and wants a full-color hologram kit of their own, these will be commercially available some time in the middle of the year. However, we will be fulfilling all of our Kickstarter backers first before any regular commercial sales, since they were the heroes who helped make this possible. The retail price for the full-color hologram kit is expected to be about $329 when it is available. Lastly, I got a brief break last week to bring my kids in to do some "kid testing" of the full-color hologram kit, and it was a blast! We made a couple of full-color holograms of some multi-colored pencils that came out nicely, and my youngest daughter demanded to take one of the holograms to school for show-and-tell. Her class didn't have a spot light to view the hologram in its best lighting (and it was a cloudy day unfortunately), but the the class thought it was really cool. The hardest part about the whole process was getting 3 young kids to sit quietly in the dark for several minutes during the exposure. But the payoff was great! I'll try to post some pictures of our holograms shortly in the comments section below. Again, thank you for all of your patience and support. I look forward to seeing what holograms you can create in the future. - Paul The first of the Kickstarter Full-Color Hologram Kits has been shipped! Shipping all of them is still going to take a little while, but I'm very excited to see them start leaving their home here at Litiholo and heading for their new homes around the world with our Kickstarter heroes. Thanks for all your support and patience during the process. I'm please with what we've accomplished in this kit, being able to create a simple kit that can make full-color reflection and transmission holograms right in your home for a reasonable price. A true first! I'll also keep you posted on when the Full-Color Hologram Kits will be available for regular retail sale. It should be shortly after we finish all of the Kickstarter deliveries. Thanks. - Paul The lasers just got delivered! They've been in Cincinnati for the last week or so while Customs and the FDA were holding them (large quantities of lasers can raise some questions), but they got released late last night and just showed up here. Here's a picture of the new arrivals, along with a LOT of hologram film that will be going out soon. I'll keep you posted on the laser testing, which is the next step. We have been working feverishly to finally get all of the lasers for the full-color hologram kit -- the red, the green, and that elusive blue. I wanted you guys to see some of the first successful tests in color. This has been extremely challenging, and there was definitely a reason why no one had ever made a full-color hologram kit before this. But success comes to those who persevere. And it comes to those who are patient, which you guys have been. Thank you. Here's a little taste of what you'll be getting soon. - Paul <url>"GeekDad approved" this morning by Jonathan Liu over at Wired.com. It's a great article, from a busy GeekDad who just couldn't pass up some cool holograms. Congratulations to everyone again for helping to make this happen. Exciting times in the hologram community! - Paul You asked for it, and you got it! There's a new pledge level called the Early Backer Plus Film Upgrade, which lets you get more film for your Early Backer kit - 50 plates instead of the standard 20. To upgrade your pledge to the new level, go to the project page and click “Manage Your Pledge,” then change your pledge amount and your reward selection. And while you're on the project page, take a look at some of the quotes and raves we've been receiving in the news and blogs. I've also been working on creating some stretch goals, which would provide new value if we are over-funded (upgrades if the project reaches $50K, $100K, etc.). I would love to hear your ideas of what you'd like to see. Thanks again for your support and encouragement. Keep spreading the word. And if anyone knows Hologram Tupac (or Hologram Elvis), please let them know about the project so that they can see how real holograms are done! - Paul Well, it's been just under a week, and we are already 41% funded! Thanks to all of our great backer for your support, and keep spreading the word. We need your help to keep attracting the blogs, news, and friends so that we can complete our goal, and maybe beyond. I'm excited about what kind of extras we could do if we were to get over-funded! In the mean time, I've been getting in green and blue lasers for testing. It's been a lot of fun lighting them up and occasionally zapping the cars outside (don't worry, low enough power so no damage). While the wavelengths (colors) are definitely available now, it is still difficult to find lasers with the proper stability for creating holograms. So I'll be doing some thorough testing over the next while to make sure we have lasers that make the grade. I'll try to share some of the test holograms as we go along. Have a great red, white, and blue 4th of July, from the diy full-color hologram kit project (red, green, and blue)! - Paul
