Hello to all our previous backers and widespread ESPRO community, We have some seriously exciting news for you! Yesterday we launched a brand new Kickstarter Campaign, the ESPRO Ultralight. Because YOU were our original supporters we wanted to give you the heads up to get ahead of the game and be some of the first to get your hands on the Ultralight at early bird prices. The ESPRO Ultralight has been designed to be the LIGHTEST coffee press and hydration bottle in the WORLD. The loop functioning lid lets you tie the press onto any backpack and with its slim body can fit into any standard cup holder of a car. The Ultralight comes in three sleek colors - Gunmetal Grey, Matte Black and Brushed Stainless, so whatever your preference be sure to head on over to our new Kickstarter and check out the early bird offers!! With the Christmas Season upon us and the new ESPRO Travel Press definitely coming to life, there's lots to be thankful for! We have made a lot of progress on the new Travel Press. There is just about 48 hours left on the KICKSTARTER campaign to preorder! Here's a first look at the new filter set which are nearly complete! <url>… Hello all! This may be our final post for this campaign. Never say never, but it could be time to move the party over to our new campaign for the Medium 18 oz Espro® Press… TWO (MICHELIN) STAR COFFEE Recently, we heard some exciting news involving the Large Espro® Press, which we would like to share. In most things, two stars are not that great. I've stayed in a few two star hotels – they were adequate, but nothing out of the ordinary. However, in the world of great restaurants, getting two Michelin stars is AWESOME! In 2012, Geranium Restaurant in Denmark adopted the Espro® Press for their coffee service. They were also named the 49th best restaurant in the world. In the 2013 Michelin guide they earned their coveted 2nd Michelin Star. So, your large press makes two (MICHELIN) star coffee! THE MEDIUM ESPRO® PRESS CAMPAIGN IS ALMOST OVER! Many of you have already supported our second Kickstarter campaign – thank you! It has been wonderful to see so many of you again. If you were still thinking about picking up a Medium Espro® Press, there are only 3 days left in our Kickstarter campaign, so please don’t delay! It is the perfect size for sharing with another person, and is great at delivering hot coffee for hours of increased productivity – it has certainly helped me! Here's the link to the new campaign. In the updates for this campaign we are sharing more of the process of launching a new product – from design, to trade shows, to manufacturing. Should be an interesting experience! <url>™ Press! It is EASILY the most asked-for product in our history - making 2 Cups (18 oz) of perfect ESPRO™ Press coffee. With your help, we launched the LARGE ESPRO™ Press here last year. Since then, it was raved about in Popular Science, Wired, Time Magazine, and the New York Times. Thanks to you, it has shipped across the globe, entered Michelin starred restaurants, and gone on many coffee shop menus. We truly appreciate the start we received from you, our Kickstarter supporters. We also received a lot of great feedback from you, and this new size is in response to your feedback! It has been under development for over a year, and required difficult advancements to achieve the design we wanted, in the size you and our other customers have asked for most. It will serve enough to share, and enough to serve on bar in a coffee shop or restaurant. We would love your support! Preorder, tell your friends, tweet, facebook, and pin the attached pic to your Pinterest page! We truly appreciate your help in getting the word out! This is the direct link: <url>– other than you receiving them! This marks the end of many months of hard work by everyone on the Espro Team, and I want to thank them all for their dedication. If you haven’t received an email with your tracking number, send us an email (<email>) and we will get it to you. FEEDBACK FROM KICKSTARTER BACKERS The proof is in the cup, and it is great to hear your comments. Here are a few! Wow! It's a completely different tasting coffee. Rich bold full of flavor and. No grit. …this press makes me want to have coffee 24x7. It's that good. Got my kickstarter reward for the Espro Press today. The double filtration really delivers a nice cup! I used my new @esproblog espro press this morning to make amazing coffee. So good. Made my first batch of coffee today, and fell in love. Great product, and CDN to boot! Just got my new Espro coffee press via @kickstarter and it is fantastic - brilliant Canadian design. Wer übrigens mal richtig leckeren Kaffee trinken will, sollte sich dieses Ding hier kaufen - der Hammer! I'm enjoying a cuppa from our new espro press right now. WHOOT WHOOT! Got mine yesterday, perfect coffee maker! I got my Espro Press last week! All I can say is wow! The build quality is beyond anything I've seen in any coffeepress and it makes the best coffee I've ever had. This is the best coffee maker I have ever purchased and I'm serious when I say I don't want any other press. Well done Espro! Received my Espro press late last week, and I have to say I couldn't be happier with the product. Excellent design. Exceptional materials and construction. Really nice to see such a professional and innovative product designed in Vancouver! TESTING THE GOODS REVIEW IN POPULAR SCIENCE In April, we were honored to be in the print issue of Popular Science Magazine . Popular Science has completed a rigorous test of the large press, and has posted a “Testing the Goods” article. Their verdict: I like the press a lot! It's a great-looking press pot to have on your counter, or to impress guests, or to medicate several hungover guests from the night before. The thermal insulating works pretty well, and the construction is solid and impressive. The coffee it makes is very good--it definitely achieves its goal to bring a press-pot cup of coffee without the grit, although since it's noticeably lighter and cleaner I'm almost tempted to put it in its own category, as a non-French press. But either way, it makes delicious, non-gritty coffee. It is quite expensive, but given its construction, it seems like it'll last a lot longer than my oh-so-breakable Bodums (plural, sadly, intended), so if you look at it as a long-term machine, it's not really that much to spend. You can read the full article here . Now that Popular Science is Espro Press powered, expect more great content! SCAA 2012 Every year, experts and consumers gather at the Specialty Coffee Association of America Symposium and Exposition. This year it was held in Portland, Oregon. We met a lot of great people, saw some old friends, and drank a lot of coffee! It was a fantastic experience. Here are the before and after photos of our booth. From start to end, the booth was crammed with people. This is a shot of Chris serving up coffee to the folks from Stumptown – a must visit in Portland. People loved the design of the large press, and the coffee it made. We brought a few large presses to the show, and they were sold out by the half-way point. On the last day, people camped out in our booth to buy the presses we used to make coffee during the show, including the one I was using at home! We also had an excellent visit from Will and Norm at Tested.com . Will is a big coffee fan – we featured his review of the small press in our Kickstarter campaign. This is a shot of Bruce serving up some coffee from the large Espro press. This is Chris, Bruce and David Makin, who was 2nd in the World Barista Championships 2008. He uses our Espro Calibrated tamper, and has a café and roastery in Melbourne, Australia called Axil Coffee Roasters. This is a rare photo of most of Team Espro (especially rare that we are all stationary)! We had guest brewers as well. Lalo Perez-Varona (who competed in the SW Regional Brewers Cup with the Espro Press) made coffee in the booth for a few hours, and taught us some new techniques. He will be opening up a roastery and café in Mexico City. Jordan Barber (below), NW Regional Brewers Cup winner and USBC competitor, dropped by to check our BIG Press. Jordan has been using the single-serve press in competition this year. And below is Matt Lewin (Roaster at Axil Coffee in Melbourne, Australia) serving up some gorgeous latte art. The kind folks at Rancilio loaned us a sweet espresso machine for people to try out our tampers and pitchers. We framed and posted our goal on top of it: Our goal is to take care of the science of making coffee and espresso so that you can focus on the art. CONTINUE TO SEND US YOUR FEEDBACK! Thank you all so much. Please continue to send us your feedback on the press - it is truly appreciated. Best Regards, Chris, Bruce, and the entire Espro Team SHIPPING BEGAN MARCH 29/12, ENDING APRIL 20/12 Presses head out to Kickstarter backers almost every day! We have shipped out 162 already, and our plan is to ship the rest by April 20. We appreciate your patience, as we work hard to get these presses out to you. So here’s what this should mean for each of you… 1. You should expect your press to be sent by April 20th, maybe sooner! 2. Depending on where you live, it could take a week (within North America) or more (international) after that for you to receive your press. 3. If you have not received your press by May 1st (in North America) or May 15th (International) please contact us directly (<email>). We realize that each of you is anxious to receive your press. We can’t blame you – the coffee from it is really good (as some of you have already found out). Rest assured – while we cannot reasonably tell each of you precisely when you will receive your press, it will be very soon! SO – YOU HAVE RECEIVED YOUR PRESS IN THE MAIL. NOW WHAT? STEP 1. UNBOX The box contains an Espro Press and an instruction manual. Wash the press in warm soapy water before using. This is how the micro-filter assembles. Wet the o-ring to ease re-assembly. <url>~1000 ml of water. A 3/4 pot (bottom fill line) uses about 38 - 45 g coffee, and ~750 ml of water. <url>’t control grind size, so every brew will be different. Grinding just before brewing is best. STEP 4. HEAT WATER Coffee brewed with boiling water is bitter, and brewed with cool water is sour. Use some of the water to preheat the press, and let the kettle sit for a minute or two. Ideal brew temperature is 195 – 205 °F (91 – 96 °C). STEP 5. BREW Start a timer for 4 minutes, put the coffee into the press, and fill with water to the appropriate line. We like to give the grinds a slight stir (or swirl) half-way through, to mix the floating grinds. Insert the filter and lid (don’t press down yet!) to keep in the heat. <url>’RE DONE, IT’S TIME TO CLEAN UP Remove the filter (carefully, as it may be hot). Pour out the grinds, and wash the container with a soapy cloth. Clear out the sink – the press won’t break, but glasses in in the sink might! There are three options for cleaning the filter. 1. Separate the top and bottom filter, and clean with a soft bristle brush 2. Dishwasher, top rack only 3. Fill press with soapy water and press filter up and down, rinse Assemble the top and bottom filter when wet, to ease assembly of the o-ring. INSTRUCTION MANUAL For those that would like a sneak peak at the instruction manual, you can see it here . Let us know your thoughts (<email>)! Best Regards, Chris, Bruce, and the entire Espro Team POPULAR SCIENCE We are incredible excited to be featured in the April issue of Popular Science! We were interviewed a few months ago, and we have been waiting (very impatiently) for the magazine to come out. Pick one up and check out pages 12 and 13. There is a great photo of the press and filter. Both Bruce and I (Chris) are big science geeks, and have read Popular Science since we were kids, so this is a career highlight. You can also check it out on line here . WRAPPING UP PRODUCTION Our last update covered the lip seal and o-ring. This time we are updating you on the container and the top (secondary) filter. The Container Containers are complete and in our warehouse. We are extremely happy with them, and we think you will be too. Most common French Presses are made of single wall glass, which is easily broken, and loses temperature quickly. There are some double wall stainless steel presses, but they are typically not vacuum insulated. The Espro Press is double wall stainless steel with vacuum insulation. This has three benefits. First, the brew temperature stays very consistent during the brew process, which means you can extract a very precise flavour profile. As you vary the brew temperature, different flavours are emphasized, and you can tune the temperature for the optimal flavour. Second, the coffee pours hot, and stays hot. Please be careful when you pour, and let the coffee cool slightly before your first sip. The double filter also isolates the grounds from the coffee, so there is less extraction after filtering. This means you can leave the coffee in the press longer than with a common French Press. Third, this container will be around for a long time! They are incredibly durable. Each press weighs 2.6 lb (1.2 kg) total. This means no more glass to clean up and replace. Here are the presses stacked up and ready for packaging. And here they are ready to ship to our warehouse. The Top (Secondary) Filter Top filters were molded last Thursday, and the lip seal and o-ring assembled to them. Here is a picture of the first batch. The top filter is your second line of defence against grinds in your cup. It also holds the lip seal, o-ring, and the nut that the handle screws into. There is a lot going on in this part! Many thanks to our Vancouver vendor - they have worked very hard to get this part right for you. Next Steps The bottom (primary) filters will be molded on Monday March 26, and the brace will be molded on Tuesday March 27. Wednesday March 28 we complete assembly by putting the filters into the presses. The first units are scheduled to ship on March 29! We won't be able to get them all out in March, so please be patient with us, as we work hard to get them out as soon as we can. SURVEYS Surveys are out! We need your shipping information so we can get your press out as soon as it is ready. Thanks for your support! Best Regards, Chris, Bruce, and the entire Espro Team A PRIMER ON THE SEALS IN YOUR ESPRO PRESS Common French Presses allow coffee grinds through in two ways: through the filter mesh (which has holes many times greater than the Espro), and along the walls (metal against glass makes a relatively poor seal). In a typical French Press, we've seen instances where grinds can bypass this type of seal. Early on in our design process we knew we couldn't just fix the filter, we needed a better seal! So we created a custom solution: a lip seal with two lips that conform to the inner wall of the press and provide double sealing. This prevents grinds from passing around the seal and getting in your cup. Why are we writing an update about seals? Well, the full production run of seals was received today. The lip seal is a custom FDA approved silicone seal, made by a company in Quebec, Canada. The other seal, which keeps coffee from passing between the filters without going through the filters, is the o-ring. This is also an FDA material, by a US company. You can see both seals (fitted to the last pre-production filter) below. The rest of the parts are in production. We will update you soon, as we will be visiting the factory for final inspection of the container and lid. AND THE WINNER IS! We would like to congratulate Jordan Barber (Third Rail Coffee in NY, NY), who won the US North East Regional Brewers Cup Championship! His brew method was the Single Serve Espro Press. The competitors make 9 cups of coffee in three services. The coffee is evaluated on aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body, and balance. The competitors are evaluated on how they describe the taste of the coffee, their customer service, and the overall impression they give. Jordan will next compete at the US Brewers Cup Championships in Portland, Oregon (during the SCAA tradeshow). You can read the full article from Sprudge . PORTLAND, HERE WE COME The Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA) hosts a yearly tradeshow and symposium. This year it is in Portland, Oregon. If you are in the neighborhood, drop by for a cup of coffee (made with an Espro Press of course)! You can find us in booth 3095 from April 19-22. Event details are here ( <url>’re excited and many of you are asking about the shipping date. We will announce it shortly. Stay tuned! We’ll be sending the survey soon, so we have your current shipping address. Cheers, Chris and Bruce Hello all - We wanted to provide a quick status update, to let you know how production is going! All week we ran countless tests to optimize filtration, and drank phenomenal coffee using the pre-production prototypes. We have also gone back and forth with our vendors to ensure the pre-production units are up to our exacting quality standards. The coffee we have been having on the press tastes incredible! Bruce's favorite so far is a Ugandan Peaberry ( <url>"Manage Your Pledge" next to our video on the Espro Kickstarter page, then follow the steps to adjust your pledge. Best Regards, Chris. THANKS! We are excited and humbled by the amazing response over the last week - 340% funded! Thank you very much. The message of press coffee without the grit is definitely resonating with people who love coffee! A big thanks to Kristen Philipkoski at Gizmodo for her article "This New Press Pot Could Solve..." As we get closer to the end of this phase of our Kickstarter project (12 days to go!), we ask that you pass on the message to anyone who loves great coffee. THE ESPRO HANDLE We would also like to invite you into the product development process, by focusing on one part of the design: the Espro handle! We wanted this to be more than your average plastic button. So, we are casting and plating it! The first shot here is both presses together, showing the relative size. The large handle hasn't been plated, so it doesn't shine yet. This prototype is to make sure that we are happy with the detail in the mold. The second photo shows a top view of the two handles again. The large one is 45 mm (1.77") in diameter and weighs 66.5 g (2.34 oz) unplated. It is hefty! The third photo is a front view. The large one is 21.5 mm (0.85") tall. We think you are going to be proud to put this out on the table for guests! Cheers, Chris. Thanks to all our supporters, as of tonight this project's a go! Each of you has voted with your pocketbook for a better cup of coffee. We are thrilled and humbled and look forward to many exciting announcements in the weeks to come. While our team is busy at work getting this product completed, shipped and delivered to each of you, here are four ways you can continue your efforts as a member of our extended product-launch team! 1. Tell your friends about our project - they can officially PREORDER a large Espro Press with certainty that they will receive one of the first production run, as soon as humanly possible! 2. Tell your local coffee shop and home goods store that you want them to sell the Espro Press, and that we would love to hear from them (based on our initial discussions, we already know this product is going to be sold in the four corners of the world - from North America to Brazil, Europe to Russia, Africa, Australia, Singapore and beyond). 3. Tell us who we should be selling through in your region (sometimes they don't immediately respond to consumer suggestions); we will work over the coming months to reach out to each and every one of them as we expand distribution. 4. Tell us which blogs should be talking about this product. Ask them to do so! We will too. Thanks again for all your support. And a HAPPY NEW YEAR from the team at Espro.

Wired Gadget Lab: "Espro Press, a French Press That Works" Gear Patrol: "Im-press-ive" @CoffeeKevin: "I rarely distribute press releases but the Espro press is so good." FIRST STAINLESS STEEL PROTOTYPE We received our first vacuum insulated stainless steel prototype yesterday! I made the first brew this morning, and the coffee is still hot 90 minutes later! For a first prototype, I am really impressed with their work. Here is a shot of the press in front of the tree. Happy Holidays, Chris, Bruce, and the entire Espro Team Half Way There! A big thanks to our backers - we are humbled, and appreciate your support! And Getting Noticed! Thanks also to our friends and supporters in the coffee and tech communities for getting the word out. Coolest-Gadgets Geeky Gadgets Blogue de Geek TimeRobots.ru ROASTe.com CoffeeForums @CoffeeGeek - Sweet... @esproblog has a new kickstarter program to get us a larger Espro Press - you can buy in on this early on @jasondominy - Help them make a larger Espro Press! I dig the smaller one for taste! @WilliamRoy55 - Coffee LOVERS need this: The Espro Press takes a new approach to coffee-making @vkamutzki - The Espro Press might just be my new camp coffee maker. There's only so far from civilization I'm willing to go. Retail Price Set - You Save Money by Being First The retail price is set at $99, so the Kickstarter price saves you $14 (14%). And shipping in the continental US and Canada is free, saving you even more! Retailer Support is Growing We now have three retailer backers, who will be the first to sell the large Espro Press. Chris Coffee (www.chriscoffee.com) was first, followed by Hickory Hills (www.hickoryhillscoffee.com) and Venia Coffee (www.veniacoffee.com). We are recognizing them in the retailers section of our site (www.espro.ca/usa/). Pre-Production Filters are Here Our filters will be molded right here in Vancouver, at a fantastic shop. Below is a photo of a pre-production unit - I am really proud of these guys. The filter you see is the primary filter, which does the first round of separation. The secondary filter nested inside is finer still, and removes even more grinds. The double silicone lip seal stops grinds from getting around the filter. There is also an engineered o-ring seal inside that makes it easy to take the filter apart for cleaning. The spider web part is a brace that keeps everything sturdy. Let's Continue to Grow! If you know of anyone who could back us or spread the word, please send them our way. Thanks! Chris, Bruce, and the entire Espro Team Hello everyone, and thank you so much for your support! We are well on our way to launching our large Espro Press on Kickstarter. There are two things we would like to share with you. The first is our press release. We will be sending this out to raise awareness for our Kickstarter Project. If you know anyone who could help by spreading the word, please send it on to them.
