No key I've sent 3 emails and got nothing back. I STILL haven't got a key for unfortunate spacemen Revisiting old Kickstarters and I realized that I never got a key for Unfortunate Spacemen. I have not yet received a key for unfortunate spacemen I have not yet received a key for unfortunate spacemen. I have not yet received a key for unfortunate spacemen I have not yet received a key for unfortunate spacemen as well. I am also missing my key for unfortunate spacemen I still haven't received an email with the unfortunate spacemen key. The last email I got through KS was update #127 on 3rd of May. Unfortunate Spacemen is already way more awesome then TDL ever was. I have no problems what so ever with the fact that TDL was cancelled - I got Unfortunate Spacemen as a thanks for my initial investment in TDL and I find that quite fair. Honestly, let's all just leave this TDL crap behind us and look to the future. Best of luck, Sandswept! :) While I never read into the bad press, this whole situation of the project being so badly bungled up has left me with a bad taste in my mouth towards Sandswept. People paid for a game you said you could finish on the budget you posted and you came nowhere near that. I don't believe the problem was you guys failing to emulate DayZ, it was failing to get your name and your game out there to show what you could do. The game had a great concept, it was marketing of said game that failed miserably. Where were the Alpha invites being sent out to people like FrankieonPCin1080p, JackFrags or others like them? Where was the press? Again, I don't believe anyone pocketed the funds (bitter former employees will say anything, so people have to take what they say with some salt), but the way this project was handled by Sandswept has left a bad taste in my mouth. I've been burned buying into games before with glamourous promises, with said games never realizing their potential. I'm sorry to say but I will be adding Sandswept in with the list of companies I boycott (alongside Gearbox and Piranha Games Initiative). When I finally get the game I was promised and the product I was promised, I will give it a whirl and will remove my boycott against the studio, but until then as a businessman myself I can't support a company like this, financially or verbally. With all of that said though, I hope your studio can get its problems sorted out and can give backers the game they were promised. Good luck on your next game and on getting back to working on this one. Good luck with that, exoScoriae. As much as it sucks that they canceled the game and we won't get anything resembling an actual game, they technically fulfilled their obligation for this Kickstarter project. I certainly wouldn't consider wha ttehy released a "polished alpha", but that's a different debate. This Kickstarter was founded upon a premise similar to what Mojang did with Minecraft, something I don't doubt for a moment is what Sandswept had in mind at the genesis of this project: get the game out there as early as possible, allow people to pay for it, then use those payments to further development on the game until that "1.0" release milestone. Sandswept definitely failed on reachign that goal, but in terms of this Kickstarter, they technically did what they said they would do in the pitch and the campaign page. And "technically" is the key word here. I'm down to pop some popcorn and pull up a seat to see what happens, but I'm afraid your words don't carry the weight you think they do, unfortunately. Still sucks that Sandswept completely bungled the development of this game and I'll never get to play the full game, though. I definitely won't play their games in the future (if there are any), nor will I give them a cent further and will advise others to not do so, but I think anything to be done regarding this Kickstarter project is also dust in the wind. Those terms *have not* protected others, and they won't protect you. And since you guys like quoting Kickstarter's terms so much, here is a quote for you: "If the problems are severe enough that the creator can't fulfill their project, creators need to find a resolution. Steps should include offering refunds, detailing exactly how funds were used, and other actions to satisfy backers." I am currently drawing up an article for Rock, Paper, Shotgun, IGN, Kotaku, Polygon, Reddit, as well as any and all crowdfunding websites I can find. I have also prepared a ticket to mark your project as a scam over at kickscammed as well as preparing edits to update various databases of scammed kickstarters. You won't be the first, or the last, company to be bankrupted by failure to fulfill their obligations on kickstarter. You also won't be the first to be bankrupted under the old pre-2014 terms. Those terms have protected others, and they won't protect you. Refund or lawsuit. The game described by the campaign was not released. No where in the terms does it say that a substitute game can be released in lieu. And regardless of what you think the KS terms were prior, you are bound to the current terms. I personally went after Neal Stephenson and forced his hand on the Clang! refunds. You either paypal me my $25, or I do the same with you. See, for me it isn't about the money, it's about shady business. I will gladly spend money on a lawsuit just to bankrupt you for this. Hell, that would give me more pleasure than actually getting my refund. So go ahead, choose your own adventure. Game effectively cancelled after 3 and a half years. How do we get our Steam keys for this? I've gotten lost on this project since April 2012. Is there a new release date? Hi, I sent two message to tkeene [at] sandsweptstudios.com on Sep 27, 2014 and Oct 18, 2014 and one to your kickstarter account on Oct 22, 2014 and still no key, could you please refund me now ? Thanks. Hi, when can i get my second cd key? I still havnt recieved a code,and I never made a sandswept account Hey guys, I seem to be running into a bit of trouble. I don't seem to have a Steam Key available to me despite backing at the $25 level, and even though I've registered for the forum. Is there a step I missed? Thanks! This comment has been removed by Kickstarter. Greenlit! Woo! :D Hi would you consider a wii u relase down the road. On wii u there is a free update capability and you set your own prices. <url>"in October" release. I'm guessing the June 2012 Estimated delivery is a bit... unrealistic. Any idea what we can realistically expect? Yeah, been a member on the forums for awhile but didn't know about the twitter ill go ahead and follow! Also ive noticed in the Forums i don't have the exclusive medal how do i get that. Since ive pledge 25$ Has there been any updates since the game received its funding? @Lewis I was going to mention Dead State but I see you're already on there. :D I'm actually encouraged to see all the interest in the Day Z mod. TDL's Kickstarter already went very well, and Day Z's success shows that there's a sizable number of players who want something different from their zombie games--not just shooting, but thinking, planning, interacting and surviving. As for competition, good ideas are bound to have company. I can't wait to see you guys prove them wrong either! :) Would've made a good movie line Well, they're wrong, DEAD wrong I tried DayZ, I think the concept is very cool and the interaction with other players is very interesting as there's no safety at all, so trust becomes and issue. However, it seems like there is little to do other than the most basic survival. I know you can repair vehicles which is cool, but apparently that is very difficult and the vast majority of players will never be able to do it., especially alone. I mentioned The Dead Linger in chat, someone said that he felt it was way too ambitious and they'd never manage to pull it off :). Hey guys, not rush or anything but ARMA II Day Z MOD beta was released today, you might have a bit of competition on hand. I'll email you a link Well... It seems I didn't get my copy... Maybe I typo'd my email address? Have all detour codes been sent out yet? Waiting for detour ;) Got detour! So anxious for TDL though XD I got my copy of Detour, thanks guys! Now, if I could somehow get a wizard to turn this game into The Dead Linger, I'd be set! :) Can't wait to give this little game a try, looks fun. Meanwhile, if you want something to do, <url>| New concept art on <url>"lifescontradict" thing in my survey :( I just don't want to miss out on it, that's all! Game related: cant wait! :D (just read about the email trouble you're having in a comment below) I'll be patient :) You should put in an update on here when you send out the codes and post the medals. I'll be sure to see that. Oh hey - sites up! TehFrederick here - Check the twitter (<url>#!/thedeadlinger/statuses/197847124493336577) - the site should be back up within an hour. @Howell 2010 I'm getting the exact same thing on www.thedeadlinger.com. It looks like domain squatters. Hey, the sandswept forum's site turned into something else for me. Some god awful ... Well A screenie would do better to explain. This is sandswept forums <url>"Please enter your VALID contact email so we can send you a code for DETOUR, and later on; a code for The Dead Linger.". It requires the forum handle, which I also don't care to create. If I don't provide the answer to the contact email, will I actually receive my codes, or do I have to provide the forum handle. Your response isn't clear. @Xianthos, you weren't "forced" to register through their website. Besides, what is the big deal about that anyways? Thats really uncool that i was forced to register in forum :3 Should have let an option to do it or not ... Where is the DETOUR download? Wrote the email, forwarded both mails from paypal and amazon payments with that. So I think it will work :-D @cris: I should probably note, Noe's question was: "If we make further donations with paypal, will that stack for the rewards we receive?" @cris: I noticed a similar question asked in the comments for the 12th Update about this. Sandswept replied to Noe's question: "... just be sure to send us an email (<email>) telling us how much you pledged via Kickstarter and PayPal." Hope that helps. So I did the 15$ donation, provided as much information in the paypal transaction as possible. Hope this works. Or should I additional write to the sandswept contact address? Looking forward to checking out Detour! It seems we're going to have a lot of opponents to choose from. Also--and forgive the spam--there's another innovative sandbox game that just launched: <url>"receive a copy" stupid I know. @cris If you pledged above $25 you get TDL and Detour. Damn misunderstood the pledges, wanted the new game instead of detour ... Is there any way to fix this now? @Nicholas the reward is not instant. You will receive it later on. Remember, they gotta do this process with 4,218 people, making sure that everyone gets the email and that everyone pays within the next 14 days on their credit card. Yeah that's what i assumed :p Thx though :D They'll send it later, the survey is just for them to get the detail to send you the reward i got the survey, responded and never got the rewards, do we get them later? Thanks for the quick response! "Once you've signed up on the forums, just give us your username you registered with, even if you didn't get the activation email." Ok... The Chosen One I got my survey email, filled everything all out. Can't wait for the Alpha, Beta, and the final copy :D I've signed up on the forums and waited. No activation email. I've asked it to send me another. Nothing. Email address is correct. It's not in my spam bucket. Account verrification e-mail(s) slow? Congrats to everyone at Sandswept Studios and everyone that pledged. @Dean The Paypal is going on until May 9th, so not yet. Survey Received! Could we get the combined total of the kickstarter and paypal pledges. Oh damn! Glad to see I'm not the only one who wants a true zombie game. Can't wait to see the progress. Congrats guys! God i love Sandswept Studios already :D!!!!! (Belated) wooooo! @LifesContradict It is most likely to stay on its own. They may extend to Steam and they may not. But I assume that it'll, first off, just be a download from the website and then it'll open the client window for you to play the game Even if they do go to steam in the future, they'll probably offer it in various other ways due to the fact not everyone likes steam. I use it because it's just convenient, and all my games are in one place. But there are downsides to it, so for a company to go strictly steam wouldn't be very benifitial. Besides, you can always add third party games onto steam. Give them a chance to get the game out before you pressure them on where to put it ;D the ks just ended 7 hours ago. Lol. Grats on a successful campaign Sandswept! I simply cannot wait to play this game! @Howell like @Draysen said you will get a code like minecraft where you will more than likely have a small launcher or something and if they do go to steam in the future just USE STEAM? It's free and is amazing cuz there are deals ALL THE TIMEE @Howell2010 they'll send you a code via email probably to download the game digitally. It isn't going to be through Steam either but they may extend to Steam later. @Josh, no, it's "Wunderbar" for "wonderful"....I've been to Germany... Hey, I just had a thought... exactly HOW am I gonna get my copy of TDL? I dont have steam, nor do I want it. and I seriously doubt that they are gonna mail cds to everyone who wants one(Though that is what I would prefer had I a choice) I always click my old card number. I have to change it every project. @Draysen It's "Wunderbrau" :-) @There is a 7 day grace period in which any problems with payment methods can be sorted out. When you log in there should be an action needed message at the top of your screen which will send you to Amazon to retry or change payment method. wtf? my money didn't go through :( Wunderbar!!!!! Sandswept got their goal!! Can't wait for those dev logs to come out :D Ahhh i want that survey for my rewards now :3 Yay congrats Sandswept!! Everything I need to know about zombie survival I learned from Minecraft. Step 1: punch dirt from the ground. Step 2: build a 3m mound underneath you. Step 3: rest easy knowing those dirty gribblies can't reach you! Lol, thanks @Veav. Now I have to dig out my old zombie survival guide. And my binder of plans, and designs. Rage zombies: to kill. Dead zombies: they're not really "alive", just mobile. Think of it as trimming an aggressive, diseased hedgerow! Congrats Guys! Can't wait for my copy of TDL and DETOUR! nice job guys! I cant wait to see/ read more about this game in the future! ...Or kill again I suppose... Congrats Sandswept! Can't wait to see the game's progression! Congrats Guys! Congrats all!!! Now makes us some zombies to kill!! Grats Sandswept! Now get to work! :P Gratz! Good job sandswept! Congratulations sandswept, never doubted right from the beginning! Its all go from now :D I... Just... Came... Buckets! EPICSAUCE ALL OVER MY FAAAAAAACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yeah good to go. Awesome!! :D Soo close Nipped in with a pledge at the last minute :D I feel like I'm watching the ball drop on New Year's eve. I was trying to post that if The Dead Linger is a enhanced FPS or 3rd party game, in the same spirit of Deadfrontier. Then we are all in for a experience. I'm confident the team will create a rich and fulfilling world for everyone to enjoy. I just doubled my pledge...after all Zag has said in an interview that he used "The Zombie Survival Guide" as inspiration...I Like :) After checking on the team that will work on this great game I had to send my pledge in. This has some similarities to a game called Deadffrontier @Filip Remember, there will be online where you can do stuff :p Joey noooooooo Ok, just backed this. I was hyped at first, but then I got the impression it will just be an "entertain yourself"-game like Minecraft or that Fallout online mod, which aren't my kind of games *at all* but seeing as this is a zombie survival game with focus on barricading, scavenging and team play, I can spare $25 ;) Ugh, I'm sorry, I'm going to have to take my pledge off, I wont get enough money for a few hours D: They actually have emplyees that have already switched to working on TDL full time... They'll receive all the money within 15 days after the pledge is over. Once they receive all the money (that is, hopefully everyone actually pays their credit card or debit off), they'll begin full time! :D Err, that's "admin nominations". Silly me. Now that the Kickstarter drive is running to a close, we should start working on the The Dead Linger wiki. A well-written wiki is not only useful for current players, but can tell people more about the game and encourage them to buy it. It's in a pretty basic state right now and is in need of more editors. We're also in the process of electing administrators. Official wiki: <url>"proof of concept" and the game is underway. Been watching this project for a long time and just decided now to pledge. My worries are in what they can accomplish with $60k ($150k now!) relative to how far they need to go, but I see we're basically helping to fund the "polished alpha" version, which we'll get, and which will be used to likely seek additional funding from other sources in order to turn it into a multi-year project, with what the developers hope will be "Crysis-level" graphics eventually. Looks like a long road ahead of them, but from what I read from the developers (on Kickstarter, their forums and on Twitter), this is a good team who knows the zombie genre well. They're communicative, talented, and it'll be fun to watch TDL develop along with the other 4000+ backers/enthusiasts. :D :D BROKE 150K! $108 to go! Let's get to 1000 people! Yeah true, might just get arma 2 later on, backed this a while ago, just gonna stick with this :3 But there's a convincing post over at <url>#p19341 that explains a few things about what is and isn't being shown so far. @Nicholas Protip: Arma 2 will be around six months from now. This kickstarter ends in 6 hours. }:D I am really stuck right now lol, dunno if i want to see where the developpent is going and if i like it buy it later and remove my pledge now, and get Arma 2 for the Day Z mod or just stay with this... Decisions decisions.... Even with 'minecraft graphics' this game will be worthwhile :D Kinda scary backing so much for just a simple promess..but I have faith the Studios will make a nice game. Plus playing even in Alpha sounds cool. @Trotterwatch I put in the most that I could (25usd) lets hope that in the next 11 hours someone donates $2,015 I like what I see in that engine doc. Pledge bumped. With Shadowrun funded, this is now the 'hot project' ending soonest; that should spike interest a bit more! @Veav there are screenshots of progress so far here <url>"another zombie game" besides already established franchises with dozens of sequels. The industry goes with what works and right now (and for the past few years) its sequels and rehashes, because those sell. Players seem to be content with being spoon fed the same crap each year with a slightly different flavor. Something like this comes along and people coming off the monotony of other games end up thinking this is overly ambitious. Its good to be ambitious, that isn't a bad thing and everything mentioned so far about this game is well within the realm of possibility. @Eric D. Mods are great, but they are limited to the engine they're modifying. And the ARMA engine is very limited. This is game being built from the ground up with the emphasis on it's concept. That is quite a huge threshold to take account. Wow, 233% of the pledge! @Michael Mishey...I agree, this project is very ambitious. If it accomplishes even half of what they plan, then it will be fantastic. I'm also glad that they are releasing it in a polished alpha, so we can play earlier and watch and participate in the game's growth. Just make this game so epic that it will be talked about for years to come Sandswept! The Dead Linger isn't just the most ambitious indie game I've ever heard of; it's perhaps the most ambitious game I've ever heard of, period. I'd doubt Sandswept was up to the task if I hadn't looked at their forum, where the only people with more enthusiasm than the fans are the developers themselves. Good luck, guys! I tried out the DayZ mod for Arma 2 and am removing my pledge so I can donate to this. I'm also really afraid your game won't be as good as this. Still good luck with it, it has been a nice ride ! Just backed, although GNU/Linux support is still uncertain. I wrote with you guys at the beginning of this Kickstarter and was kind of waiting for another update on a GNU/Linux version. Now I backed in the hope of seeing a GNU/Linux client eventually, since the game looks like something that I've always wanted to play and since I want to support you on this project. Also it doesn't hurt so secure my personal "Kickstarter" in case that there will eventually be a GNU/Linux version. Just pledged $25 I know it's not much but every little helps! I wish you the best of sucess with this game. I have one question which email address will all of the codes for the beta and alpha be sent to... My kickstarter? or my Amazon? or the card email address i paid with? Thanks and good luck! I have to say, I'm glad I've stumbled on this game. I backed though you clearly don't need my support at this point. I just wanted to say, this is the Zombie game I have always wanted, or at least what you are planning is. A first person zombie survival horror game that is procedurally generated is the end all for zombie games, IMO. Upped my pledge... @LifesContradict Seriously - up your pledge and trust them... also you will become a famous zombie in this game ;-D Other things like individual houses/weapons/cars etc... I guess those individual things could have a negative influence to the other game content. I would up my donation to $1000, maybe $2000 to this cause, if it gave me something back. I mean being in the game is cool and all, but $2000 dollars is a lot of money to donate must to shoot yourself over a d over... Especially if you don't have some sort of personal reimbursement, ya know? I'd totally drop a lot into this, but I don't feel I would be getting enough bang for my buck. 2k down on a car, you get a car. 5k down on a house you get a house. 2k down on a game though...? Maybe you could help me out here, Sandswept Studios. It can be in a personal message if you want ;) although what's 2 more k when you're getting $130,684 at the time of posting this... I'm torn on my decision to donate more because the harsh reality of 'are you about seeing fans as individuals, or about making money to develop a game with minimal individualism outside of monetary spent rewards?' is coming into my head.. -LifesContradict aka LC Not quite sure if I should back up even higher.... well I got 66 hours to deiced. But seriously people, TELL EVERYONE!!! Tell everyone how awesome this game is gona be so they can get even more money >:) Just backed 50 bucks Hey everyone just a heads up to follow the Sandswept icons like Zag or Dana on Twitter because I saw a few screenshots of the pre-aplha world that they haven't posted on here. If i had Twitter id be following like a zombie to a gunshot! I suppose a final video to motivate last minute backers is out of the question? :-) @Drakol I really agree, all this money must be able to do something, and I really cant wait for this to become playable, so if you can, please kick the release date up the butthole so hard it goes back in time! If this game makes it to steam would we be able to transfer our copy on to it. This is probably going to be good - but the Developers should think about the "Kick it Forward" plan - seeing as they've gone over the goal about double. ^_^ I suspect that for $1000 you can make as many suggestions as you like. I think my question got lost in amerispam so here I go again: For the "You" update, are you allowed to make suggestions for the items? Personally I would select a sturdy floor scraper as my melee weapons of choice. If you go for the 2K pledge, will the 'you' zombie/survivor be wearing the 'you' kit? @LifesContradict zombies have been a hot ticket for several years, very popular in movies and games as we all know. However, I think there is a clear distinction between the more hardcore zombie fans and the larger group from the general public that just happen to be the people that would go see a zombie movie or buy a zombie game. It's kind of the same story with all video games for several years now, it's all about fast action and over the top presentation. Most people that think zombies are a cool subject for games are really more the action type, they wanna slaughter loads of zombies, not really build stuff or explore. Then on the other side, you have the gamers that are more into RPGs, but I think they are heavily into the fantasy settings, either swords and magic, or lightsabres and "the force" :). I think a slower, more deep zombie game like this is kind of stuck in the middle. The gaming community Liberty's Last Army community donation of $160 is turned in. Just got the $50 deal. Hoping son and I can play co-op in our own zombie world on LAN. Just pledged $120 for the good of the cause! I'm actually confused why none of the big companies never thought of an open-world zombie apocalypse... Nonetheless! I am happy I stumbled upon your game and I am now a proud donor (who is mad he doesn't have $1000 [to contribute to something that gets me no monetary gain anyways]). I wish you guys the best of luck in your adventures :) -LifesContradict aka LC Finally pledged, looking forward to this game, wish you all the best! I'm truly impressed by the stuff you've put out in the last few updates, so I've doubled my pledge accordingly. I can't wait to see the alpha and live in your world for a while. I'm also pleased that Sandswept employs so many younger people. I too am just starting off, so I know how hard it can be. Best of luck as the Kickstarter comes to a close! This is exactly the type of game I was looking during my whole life. Thanks for doing this guys, I'm so impatient now! I see high potential in this game project. Keep up the hard work and make us (the gamers) proud! Hay just because this ends in 4 days on kickstarter why stop. Put up another page or somthing on your site, I say keep the donations going and make even more money. I'm going to be building a gaming laptop this year for an affordable price, nothing that needs to play Battlefield 3 since I have that for the Xbox and I'm only looking to play some PC games like Left 4 Dead, Amnesia and games that don't necessarily require a hardcore computer. Can't wait for this game to come out, so glad they got over 200% budget! I agree, If this game does end up like they say it is, its going to be fnarbing awesome! I wish them all the best of luck and just cannot wait for this to get its funding and have the good guys at Sandswept get going and make me an epic game! I am genuinely tingling with excitement. Go for it guys!!! @Lazuri Cool story bro! Sorry, couldn't resist XD I'm going to tell you an interesting story! About a year ago, me and two friends were talking over steam, discussing the game we wanted to see most of all. We sat up half the night discussing it, lamenting the fact that none of us had the skills to actually create it. Imagine my surprise when, one year later, the next to exactly same game shows up on Kickstarter. I'm of course talking about this game. It literally made my whole month. Perfect, thank you guys. Pledge upped. @ Alex, if you go for either of the $50 rewards you get 2 copies, a kickstarter backpack (only applies to one of the copies), the soundtrack, and the "Detour" game. @alex you get two copies of TDL at the $50 pledge point. One other question though. I showed my brother this last night, and he damn near jumped for joy. Is there a backer level with two copies that I just miss read. Or should I start a second account? Because I would really like to get him in on this. @Gustavo- oops, point the point I was trying to make, however poorly I made it, is it does not matter a damn bit if this site originates in the USA. The community is international. And as such should be above and beyond a feeling of separation do to where you pledge from. Just one big, in this case zombie eaten, family. But in reality I just should not fall for the trolling. Sorry for the rant:) I will try to skip it in the future. Just became a backer on TDL. Yaaaaaay! Congrats on exceeding your goal and reaching 201%! I'm so excited! :D The game is looking good from what I have seen. Hope this game turns out to be what it says it will be. I am pretty excited to see what Sandswept does during the making of this game. I wish these guys the best of luck. @AlexUnderschultz Actually, 3 continents nah im lookin for dead island dismemberment you know, BOOM right in the bladder! OH! There go his intestines! (pardon the double post if people have problems with them round here) Anyone else hoping for Left for dead-like dismemberment? Congrats indeed! My comment earlier about PvP was about the Arma2 mod DayZ, I should have made that clear. For The Dead Linger, besides the general concerns, one specific concern I have is whether or not the generated map will actually be better. I like exploration and rewards of finding interesting locations with whatever, new NPCs, stashes, etc. It's very hard to get that right when the map is dynamically generated, unless you use large blocks of pre-created areas and link them in a dynamic way, but then that's not easy to get right either. For graphics, I don't mind if they aren't great, I mainly want lots of things to do, as I said in a previous comment even if the implementation is a bit cheesy looking, I want lots of crafting and building abilities, with advancing goals to craft and build bigger and/or better things. It's basically the way I imagine rebuilding some small bit of society after such an apocalypse. I don't just want to have to scavenge for food, I want to figure out a way to produce it, or water, or whatever, and then of course security goals to keep all that safe. Now that I think about it, an FPS probably isn't the best interface for what I want, but anyway :). I am looking forward to this game and if it comes out very different from what I want, well that's a risk I will take. All ranting aside.@josh thanks for throwing us over the 200% mark! Also, stop using the word "America" to describe only the USA. I am north American supporting this site from south America along with many others. America encompasses two continents and dozens of countries. Your attitude shames us all. Thank you eraser, that was exactly the sort of feedback I was fishing for. CryEngine 1 is ambitious, and if it even gets close to that , the game would be fantastic. Wow, congratulations Sandswept Team for reaching the 200%. @Josh Hi , here is a little quote about the graphics from the CTO / Lead Programmer Richard Keene :" ...The eye candy will be as good as we can make them in the allotted time... and ...working toward a goal of Crysis engine level graphics..." From: <url>#p19341 Also, I'm in love. No, this is a United States based venture, that happens to allow people of other countries to use this website. Therefore, America. No fighting guys! Zombie group hugs all around....braaaaaaaaaains! Also this is not america. This is an international community based on helping others. Working and sharing with others. Try and keep that in mind before you lash out at people. This is SPARTA!! This is america. Hey now. If your going to fight wait until there are zombies to eat you when your done :) Additionally, of the 3 comments you've made on kickstarter, all 3 are designed to be inflammatory, and all 3 are telling others what they should do as if you are some manner of authority. Learn to have a little respect for others Trotterwatch comments: @Josh, they have stated that it isn't a 2 dimensional plane, its confirmed to have hills, mountains, gradients, and a realistic terrain. Do your research before spouting lies. Quit calling zombies "zeds" it sounds stupid, where did that originate from? @Alex Catchpole We don't need you here, we're already passed the donation goal go back to lego star wars please. They're not going to show incomplete gameplay because a 10 year old wants to see it so badly. @Trotterwatch. This is why people should take the time to read before showing themselves to be an idiot. I made no claims as to what they are doing. I stated that it was my fear that it would end up that way. I read their forum, but I saw nothing solidly saying that there would be gradients. Perhaps I missed it. Excuse me if I don't have enough time to do exhaustive research on a VIDEO GAME. I have a job, a house, and other responsibilities in my life. Learn to read something more carefully before calling someone a 'liar' Alrigth now you guys can work on this full time for a whole year. @Josh, they have stated that it isn't a 2 dimensional plane, its confirmed to have hills, mountains, gradients, and a realistic terrain. Do your research before spouting lies. @Mike My main concern is this huge world will get boring fast if everything simply lies on a 2 dimensional X-Y plane. Honestly this is one of the riskiest projects I backed considering there is no gameplay footage of anykind, and the team doing this has only one project that I know of which is proven. Having said that, the concept is right on the money. It's just how much polish will they put into it? Woot! 200 percent funding! Awesome guys, hopefully this means we'll get our greasy little hands on that alpha sooner. 200% F.U.N.D.E.D! @Josh I have been wondering about that, the PvP aspect. I can certainly see how easy it would be, especially for a group, to simply stalk and kill other players and steal their stuff, or just do it to be jerks :). I want to try it out but I don't think I wanna spend $30 for Arma2:CO . "WHICH IS RANDOMLY GENERATED WITHOUT VOXEL BLOCKS OR LOW GRAPHICS" I don't think this is the case, they said it would look something like a screenshot from STALKER. Also, hoping someone can answer this, but will the entire land be flat, or will there be hills, roads that climb upward, etc? @Josh And my sword You have my support, and with it, 200% funding I have an unresistable urge to up my pledge 130$ so the total will be 120k$. Too bad I can't :( Now I know this game will not disappoint me. For my whole life (Or most of it xD) I have been searching far and wide for a TRUE open world zombie survival game, with no loading screens.. no "sector maps" (Life dead island), and a mass amount of realism! Reading the features section ALONE made me buy this game! A map the size of a FREAKING SMALL PLANET?!?! ALL OF WHICH IS RANDOMLY GENERATED WITHOUT VOXEL BLOCKS OR LOW GRAPHICS?! I would have pledged 2,000 dollars if I had the money! This game just amazes me. Keep up the GREAT EXCELLENT work on TDL, and please.. PLEASEEEEE, keep to the roots of the realistic zombie survival feel! Like you started off with! There has been countless games which started off AMAZING, and got ruined due to 2 or 3 kids who wanted an arcade feel to they're zombie apocalypse. They have the game Dead Island, let us have the game The Dead Linger! Us gamers deserve a TRUE realistic cooperative multi-player open world zombie survival game! But honestly.. 16 players.. scavenging around cooperatively, or not, in a map 25,000 km in size.. Utterly breath-taking guys. Just amazing! Keep it up!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOO @Mike unfourtunately the DayZ mod has degenerated into a bunch of jerks running around like it is a death match mode the zombies are just there as a backdrop to them. Haha good choice Stefan. I was wondering that as well. For the "You" update, are you allowed to make suggestions for the items? Personally I would select a sturdy floor scraper as my melee weapons of choice. Very close to 200% funding! :D From Kickstarter's official FAQ: What fees does Kickstarter charge? If a project is successfully funded, Kickstarter will apply a 5% fee to the funds raised. If funding isn't successful, there are no charges. Does Amazon charge any fees? Yes. When a project is successful, Amazon will apply credit card processing fees, which work out to roughly 3-5%. For details on how the fee is calculated, please view the Amazon Payments fee details. Where is everyone even getting this information that Amazon is going to take an X-percentage of the funding and that an X-percentage of funding is going back to Kickstarter? It's all for the project... @ Raymond Bernardin Nope - not 5% of the total amount will be pledged - only 5% of the profit after the game is released. The whole money will be used for development - ok - amazon will also take some money but surley not 5%!! I really love this project because the most games are amazing for me where you can interact funny things with friends. So what could be funnier to explore a world of zombies with my mates, defend a house together or scavange for some food in a left supermarket... etc. yeah its a 5% fee to kickstarter and 3-5% fee to amazon, so around 12K off at the moment. The other 5% going to other projects is kicking it forward and only comes out of final profits rather than funds raised, although Kickstarter have asked all project owners to remove this since there was confusion as to whether it was officially associated with Kickstarter. and amazon takes another 5% also guys dont forget that 5% of the total pledged amount is already going to go back to Kickstarter to help with other projects that need funding. so minus about 5-7k off of this total is actually going to this game. meaning = pledge 126k! just pledged some money. I'm not normally into zombie games but i cant wait to see what it will look like! Less than 2k left to get to 200%. We can do it! Took me longer than expected but I upped my donation from 25 to 50 even though you're at almost double what you need! Congrats guys I am looking forward to following the progress of the game creation until alpha comes out! Thanks for the nice previews. Looking good! Must have taken alot to show off all your work in such an early stage. and @Beini82. Well... there's food ingame. come on, just 3,451$ for 200% of the goal! :D I've been reading and watching videos about the Arma2 mod DayZ, I think people here have mentioned it before, it looks pretty cool. At first I thought it was just shooting, but then I saw that people are actually scavenging for parts to repair vehicles and use them, that's a very cool element to add to the gameplay and goals. Goddamn it...I never planned on upping my pledge...it all started pretty harmless with Wasteland 2 (I doubled my initial pledge toward the end...), then came Shadowrun Returns, another 50 bucks gone (I came from 30)...and now here I am considering AGAIN to double my first pledge just because I want this project to live up to its huge potential...Damn you Kickstarter...stop showing me these great projects I NEED MONEY FOR FOOD!!! This game is gonna be so epic! I raised my pledge to get the Kickstarter backpack, I've got a feeling that thing is gonna come in handy! :) I liked how dark the footage in the update was. Also like the inventory. Very practical for the feel of the game. Alright, just upped my pledge and have 8 people at work in on this. Can't wait. The concept of this game is just amazing, I'm really looking forward to be playing this game :) different kind of wiki i think there is one all ready Added a wiki page to Giantbomb for The Dead LInger. <url>"the kickstarter" as well as the soundtrack? I've already seen a couple things I really appreciate in screens and that pre-alpha video. A hunger bar and a mod menu. Great, loving the updates! are you planning something special when you get 120k (200%)? 3000 Wow, even the Pre-Alpha Footage looks great! Keep on going SandSwept!!! I cannot wait for this game to be extra polished because of the extra backers. Just backed $25! So excited for the most promising zombie game ever! Fortifying found structures with your friends will be so much fun! Probably the one game on the sides of GTA 5 that has kept me really excited :D make that @Kieron* @Krieger: Braveheart moment? "Freeeeedoooooom!!" Pretty close to 3,000 backers! And the pledge number is astounding! Great job to everyone, I hope all our in-game desires become reality through this project! @Alx: the $60,000 Kickstarter goal is for bringing the game to alpha. After that the plan is for development to be funded through sales of the alpha and beta versions similar to Minecraft. Richard Keene ‏ @rkeene0517 I've quit my job. This is the first day officially full time on TDL. Hard to describe the feeling of freedom. just thought you all may be interested in this tweet :P @Scott Krieger From what I've heard I think it will be grid based. I can't wait for this game to be released. but I was wondering, how is your inventory going to work? is it like a weight limit and a list of stuff? Or is it like a grid based system like Resident Evil 4? Or is there going to be an inventory at all? 100k isn't that much money when we are talking about having a bunch of people work full time on this. Where do you think you guys will get the rest of the money from? @Joey Ellis yea I hope for the best. But truthfully I'm not really bothered about the combat mechanics, all I'm looking for is the atomspheric feeling of being one of the last alive. But that head track system would be a nice touch, I'm not fond of fps's when you have the gun constantly being held in front of you, it just seems so unrealistic and clunky. Having that free head movement adds to the freedom of character control and just adds that bit of extra immersion to the game. Either way I can't wait for this. Thats awesome to hear! Thanks for the quick response and i cant wait for more! I have a quick question. When you say 25km, do you mean 25km in planet circumfrence, planet diameter, or square km? @Michael Darling I think it'll be close to that, but much better. (Hopefully smoother animations and shooting, the zombies take awhile to realize they've been shot in that) Something i would love to find out. IMO i would MUCH rather take out some zombies with a pipe,machete or even my fists. (melee weapons) How are you guys tackling melee?Is there going to be a good amount of decent melee weapons other than firearms?Will it have a nice mechanic or is it just going to be a one button thing? Sorry for the bombardment of questions but i'm SUUUPER excited about this.This is like the game of my dreams and i have faith in you guys! Been following this game way before kickstarter and have high hopes for it. It's good that someone is finally bringing at a game like this that a lot of people have been looking for. Keep on lingering Sandswept! You'll be a happy homeless tho! After Wasteland 2, Shadowrun Returns, Grim Dawn, now I found myself a zombie survival sandbox.... I'll be homeless pretty soon if I continue to hang in KickStarter :) You guys got my 25$, I wish I could help more If TDL is anything like this arma 2 mod then i won't ever need to buy another game :) <url>#9 pop up in my inbox and I want to say I'm super excited to hear about the new rewards. I hope The Dead Linger will bring that realistic zombie, apocalypse and horror feel to mine and many other people's virtual lives. I have pledged and can't wait to get my copy. I was also wondering how we receive the Steam copy of Detour? will we get a code via email? just curious. Game looks great. So why are there two $25 rewards? it seems that they both do the same thing. Thanks for the unnecessary extra rewards! With this extra copy, maybe I can get my wife to play... probably not. @Sandswept Studios: You just made my day :D I have a question, and this is really important for me, i dont want to sound annoying, but i love it so much, so here it goes: Is there going to be gas masks in the game, if no, please think about it, we can wear it, and (maybe) we get less chance of infection or whatever. It can even be just superficial, but please, if you add it, you´re going to make a pledger SO happy. ps. Balaclavas would be awesome too! Detour on top of everything else?!?! THANK YOUU!!! I'm so pumped for this game. Too bad I don't have a time machine. Might have to wait a while but it'll be an awesome surprise once this comes out!!! They might have called the zombies "Zeds" in World War Z. That sounds familiar. i say 2 to 3 years "The launch date of the final game" could be YEARS away. They are planning to release this as alpha in a few months, beta a year or so after that, and then final release after that. The pledges are only to get them into alpha, so they can make more money from alpha. We get it all though There seem to be several different estimated deliveries in the pledges. What is the expected launch date of the final game? First off, i would like to say that i commend you all at Sandswept Studios for taking on such a challenge. I think that this game will be extremely immersive. The only thing I would like to have more information on is if or when the game will be on mac. I know it may be to early to tell, but it would be a huge weight off my shoulders if you could give me your best forecast of what is to come. -Ian Congrats on breaking 100K! Cash, I recommend looking through the FAQ. Answers quite a lot. <url>"zed" by some. @Cutter I'm excited but at the same time I always keep in mind that there's a good chance it won't be nearly as cool as I hope, or won't have the features I want, etc. A lot of the really cool ideas are going to be very difficult to simulate in the game. I will say this, if an activity is cool but they cannot come up with a great graphical representation, I wouldn't mind having that activity as an option even if it's implemented in kind of a crappy looking way. Hitting 100k today! Im very excited to watch this project progress. Just backed you guys! Really hoping that the excess funding will allow you to make a MAC version, since I backed you without even having a PC. Great concept and I wish you the best of luck! err... are you really fussed? Quit calling zombies "zeds" it sounds stupid, where did that originate from? Man, these screenshots are really making me excited! But just one question, since you guys are for sure getting the funding, are you already working full time? i hope theres a ladder on that water tower, would be a great sniper point for taking out them zeds :D Pledged, good luck. Make this game spectacular =p. What amount of money will fully bring this game to fruition? As 60k brings it to Alpha. Another early alpha screenshot was posted <url>"gameplay!", we don't have anything to look at right now. Currently I'm only aware of about 4-5 actual models that are in place and creating models is where a lot of the work goes into. At this point it just looks like a lot of ambition and nothing to show for it, hopefully I'm wrong about that, but unless we see something to prove that, you're likely to see some people start to withdraw pledges soon. I think building a sustainable farm with animals and gardens would be a nice touch. Would certainly add a whole new element that you would need to protect. And I was a big fan of the basic needs in Fallout New Vegas on hardcore mode. Having to route a water supply to your base to sustain yourself and your livestock/garden could be fun too. Can we farm? And get cattle? Lol XD I NEED FOOD Oh man only ten days left!?!? I want this project to get many more backers, not to mention funds! damn.... 500th comment living the life! Kicking it forward from Zpocalypse. Go Zombie games! If I could have one feature request, it would be for weapon handling similar to what appeared in the Infiltration mod (<url>"making the game even more awesome than originally planned:. :D @ Jesse Farnham. That looks like stalker COP. COP was a direct x 11 game. The dev indicated that this game will be dx9. If that's the case it won't look like the stalker game pictured. The style might be the same, but it won't have tessellation or other Dx11 effects. Im a backer :D Hope it all ends well guys, first pledge i make :) 5 things....ummm. 1: Chainmail. Really hard to bite through. 2: Firesteel 3: One of those demolition tools that has all the fun bits on it for tearing apart buildings 4: the keys to a Brinks truck to live in the back of. 5: an assortment of seeds. (corn, wheat, vegetables etc.) So what do you guys plan on doing with the extra 40+ thousand dollars? Thefivepiecesofgearthing: 1.eco-wind-up flashlight 2.binoculars 3. telescopic retractable steel baton. 4. knife 5. salbutamol inhaler (from asthma) 2,500 backers, :D I hope that using my Visa gift card will work, This seems amazing though. Everything seems like a good idea and the MP seems fun too. Good Job and i hope to get to pledge lol :D @ Michael Darling. Check the forums, they already said what graphics would be like <url>"stalker," which is like the graphics they'll use (found info here <url>"Search" button. If I can really get into a building, board it up, and scavenge through it in an FPS kind of way instead of just contectual, I would explode into a cloud of happiness. Hell, even if this was built on good ol' Source engine, it'd be fine. Just imagine: The streets are clear except for a lone straggler ambling down the street. You dart across, keeping low, aiming for the house with the closed door and the broken window. Jagged glass teeth fill the gaping maw of the window. You can't be too loud or you will draw the one, and he will draw others, but you have no choice. The glass shatters as it hits the floor. It's loud, but not too loud. One final glance down the street and you see that your secret is still safe. Pulling yourself through, you find an overturned table that will fit infront of the window well enough. The pistol that was tucked in your jeans is now in your hands. The safety is off. Aside from the visual noise of the chaos of the tennants' fight or flight, the house is quiet. The first floor is clear. The kitchen's bounty is mostly intact. A bottle of water is a precious find. You finally move upstairs. All of the doors are open, except for the one at the end. Still, quiet. You creep forward. You give the door a light rap, and receive a deep, airless moan in return. Kicking the door open, you fire off one round into the head like a reflex. An old man, eviscerated, collapses to the floor. He was a survivor. After clearing out the rest of the top floor, you head back to the first floor only to be greeted by a solemn and unnatural knock on the door. The knocking turns into clawing. Before you can think of how to silence the lone straggler, a second set of rotting hands join it in chorus. This makes me happy. I, and several friends of mine, have been looking for something like The Dead Linger in this genre of gaming for quite some time. In the words of several great historical figures and some colleagues, "Shut up and take my money!" Yeah over 90k! Easily into the hundred thousands! @ Alexander & Alex. That's the spirit! I mean, it's like a dream game come true, and so far they haven't deviated from a perfect track so why not stick it through? Honestly haven't seen anything that would indicate any problems with it being completely amazing and at this rate it'll be better than they expected, making everything happen that much sooner! Pledging with a hope that the future of the Linux version will become the present of the Linux version. I will keep the faith. This is a donation site. There is risk and its not just about the reward. And I have to believe that this game with be everything and more that it said because the idea is just so awesome. @Eric yeah understandable, Kickstarter is exciting and I've been spending money on it that I really shouldn't be, it's easy to get caught up in the excitement. Sometimes you gotta take a step back and be a little critical. It's pretty much guaranteed some projects, perhaps many more than we'd like to think, will ultimately fail to deliver anything or at least not what its backers expected. Not saying this project, but it's a general warning I like to keep reminding people of because as much as I like Kickstarter, I don't like the idea of people giving money without realizing there are absolutely no guarantees, you have to always keep in mind that it is basically a donation. I think i'll remove my pledge if there is no gameplay before April 30th . There is no real advantnages or any reduction of the game price, alpha will be 25$ on Sandswept website when released. It's basically nothing else than preordering. But really reading the forums and etc I became septic about this game. You say it is a hardcore survival , but I see the exact opposite the forums. Just womdering if we will know where our content is located? On my podcast both this week and next I bring up The Dead Linger and urge my listeners to donate. You can check out the episode at: <url>… If you would like to help promote the game, go post on attack of the shows Facebook and or Twitter and tell them why you're excited for this game. Now! Dave- your comment on the shadow run page hit right on the money. And for here what is everyone five choices for there gear in the event of zombie doom? Hey Dave. GeReat minds think alike eh? While your here take a look at <url>" test out all of your zombie survival plans," Guys, I miss Alex. Im just going to say leave the exposure up to the developer's. if they want us to spam someone to get some attention, then they can ask for it. Other than that, let them choose where they advertise. I am super excited to see how this game turns out! For too long I have been waiting for a game exactly like this.. I thought dead island was going to be great but something about it just didn't work for me. Lately I have been playing the dynamic zombie mod on Arma 2 which turns out to be extremely fun but the game crashes alot and theres no way to barricade(that I know of). All I ask is some kind of mobile fort like an RV or a train, what I would really love is a yacht ; ). It's more about just all of them seeing it and telling people. And everyone that follows them or looks on their Facebook will see this. @Josh Jordan how so? They always welcome indie games and always have a segment showing a few. I understand that it probably won't get on the show, but it's just about getting out there! @Jack yeah hate the show as well it's pretty much personifies whats wrong with the game industry today. @Jack well actually it could hurt :) If we try now and fail then it might ruin another chance in the future.... oh there's those people yapping about that game again that had no video or much at all to show.... I really think for a TV show, you need some video and it has to be decent video I actually hate Attack of the Show with a burning passion, but it would give the game more exposure, which is always good. I'm not an Alex-esque middle school student howling for gameplay; I get why they aren't showing any yet. But even so, getting the game featured on the show without any footage might be difficult. Still, trying can't hurt. @Alex Catchpole We don't need you here, we're already passed the donation goal go back to lego star wars please. They're not going to show incomplete gameplay because a 10 year old wants to see it so badly. Alright Saturday 6 PM central time! Works for me! Good idea man! Alex Must Be A Troll Or a 10 year old.... I agree, come on Alex give it a rest already! @Alex Catchtool: Ugh, shut up already. The game hasn't been in development for long, and screaming "gameplay" like a ten year old isn't going to do anything but piss people off. GAMEPLAY!!!!!!!!!!! Also, maybe an extra day to make sure everyone can see? I changed my other post to Saturday at 6 central. Ok I made a post @Cash maybe we should make a post on their websites forum and direct everyone to it? <url>"OVER 9000!" Too early in the day...blargh. Still getting evils off wife from backing game and the suspicion of watching pr0n. :| Any how...I'm hoping this will steer clear of the direction Dead Island went...That got old super quick...I'm hoping for a more "Zombie:The Awakening" vibe (if anyone remembers that...it got canned sadly :( ) Over 125% ! Would be easy to just flood AOTS's Facebook or twitter with comments about it. Organize a specific time and just blow em up? @Mike Yes, but AOTS is also quite different from a normal tv show. They've done similar things before. will we be given a map to our content? i am really looking forward to this game. it looks like everything i have ever dreamed of. good luck and greetings from norway. @Cash For a TV show, assuming we had ANY chance even, I think you would have to provide some video of the game. @Anders The website summary of the game mentions driving, and the forums have some vehicle discussions, so it looks like they plan to have vehicles. guy if we get just over 1,500 a day for the next 18 days we'll be at the $100,000 finally saved up enough for the $100 pledge, can't wait for this game to come out. Yeah, turn down that kid's free money! That . . . that'll show him . . . i would like to be able to dig that would be cool. i dont know if ive missed it but will the character be able to drive cars or use machines? love the concept, but im a mac user so i guess ill have to wait a while til i get to play it :/ cant wait thou :D Can you guys at Sandswept make sure every single zombie in Alex's game looks like Ryan Seacrest? That kid is annoying. Haha you should refuse his pledge. Bbbbbuuuuuuurrrrrnnnnn!!!!!!! Nor will stretching ooouuuuttt the word. Just saying. You're pledging for something pre-alpha; you have to give it time! Everybody wants to see gameplay, and we'll see it when it's ready. Posting about it every couple of hours is not going to make it come any faster. gameplay!!!!! gameplay! gameplay! please just give us gameplay! I demand gameplay! gammmeeeeeppllllaaaayyyy!!!!!!!!! @David: A little healthy pressure is good for business! @Raymond: no pressure then :P I really hope your team makes sure this game is a success. Given the turnout of Detour (i'd never heard of it before) you have yet to prove yourself as a developer. If this game fails, I can't imagine you will have the same support you have had with The Dead Linger ever again. Please make this a game that explodes your name into the gaming world as a marvelous, completely unexpected title from an otherwise unknown developer. Get yourself up there with Valve and create some healthy competetion. Good luck Sandswept and don't disappoint. I'm a belieber! Is there another specific target you guys want to aim for next? :) Cos we're now at 71 !! :-D We need to try to get Attack of the Show to do a segment mentioning this!!! EVERYBODY email aots on their website and try to get these guys the chance for their game to be on national television. This could spark so many more donations!!!! Will there be reflections and/or breakable glass? it is my pet peeve in games where the glass isn't glass its just a wall with a pre-configured image plastered onto it. although i know this would be hard to implement, im just wondering (maybe down the road?) Thanks @CaribbeanWolf, I think I will wait for some gameplay videos. Good idea. Cheers. @Joe I'd say pretty slim seeing as they already have another game (DETOUR) under their proverbial belts. Worst case scenario you can always take out the money before the day count reaches 0. This of course would be done in the most heinous of circumstances. I'm sure that before the 19 days are up they'll have some decent gameplay videos to soothe yours and everyone else's (including my own) nerves! Good luck Sandswept! What is the probability that this game gets tanked? Is it going to be, like, 50/50? Or only a 10% chance? I gotta know, I backed 50 dollars which wasn't easy making. Thanks. Here's $50 and I'm going to record and release a plug for this on our next podcast (Look for it Monday at www.BearSwarm.com) to try to help you get some bonus cash to really drive this game home. I figure every little bit helps. Wow, someone pledged 2k! Not that I have $2000 to pledge, but I think it is a shame that you cant choose to be a friendly NPC :P Or will that be the $4000 pledge! haha. Okay so I gotta know, what happens if you guys completely tank the game? Give it a break on the gameplay demands, sheesh. They made the kickstarter in order to make a better game, and its going to take a little while. Im sure they are as eager to get something polished out to us as we are to see it. Upgraded my pledge to 50! This looks like it will be stunning! Yes, gameplay! Will it be ready by the end of this week? I'm going on a trip soon, and I won't have access to a computer for a while. GAMEPLAY!!!! I WANT GAMEPLAY!!!! GIVE ME GAMEPLAY!!! I want gamely before i go ahead with donating. Just upgraded my pledge to $35! I wonder how long you guys will wait with showing some gameplay, everwhere I look I see people asking/begging for gameplay footage! Also, one small question! Will the soundtrack be available after release for purchase? Amazing, I'm the first backer of the $35 sountrack edition. thanks for replying to my message! Looking forward greatly to the game and beautiful music. :| @ wife thinking I was watching pr0n while Dana was dancing on the vlog. ZOMG! *beats head against desk* I'd be very content to see a big $180,000 pledged at the end of this campaign! @ David Someone linked this site awhile ago, pretty interesting at estimating where it'll end. Hopefully it doesn't even out since they hit 60k. The estimate was at 180k ending earlier. <url>"multiplayer (optional)" in the FAQ. Could you please confirm whether or not single player is supported? Danke TCO Oie...had to reduce my pledge again. :| Too many games. At this level I have the money in my account NOW and will possibly be able to up my pledge to around 50/100 on payday. You can also visit this link; <url>"the other two" are currently Wasteland 2 and Shadowrun. These seem to be the big kids on the block at the moment. Though there seems to be the yogscast MC style game too... O.o oie. Too many projects to back. :| I keep reading something about "the other two." What are these people referring to? If there are other Zombie games out there then I must throw my money at them all! 2012 is the year developers take back the reigns of gaming! HUZZAH! I can't wait ^_^ Doubled my pledge. Too many times I have seen zombie games that sound promising vanish into nothingness. Rawwk Now i get a backpack :P I would so love to have a big box version of this too. Well, this one will get much less funding then the other two, as it doesnt have a big name behind it. This one is also more risky though. If "lowering your pledge" on the others means lowering to not get some random bit of content, then might as well if you like the sound of this.. but if it means losing a copy of the game, or losing your collectors box set? EH. This project will be funded either way, but it all comes down to rewards really. If you want your pledge to make a difference, here is most likely the better place... but if you want awesome rewards, then the other two are. :P (I mean that in the nicest possible way too, they DO have 40x more funding, but they are still very worthy games to pledge to) Sweet! Oie...Dunno if I should lower my pledge on other projects and get a bigger one on this. All three I'm backing at the moment are so promising. ARGH! Dilemma! Under 8k to go! :) @Willy TMI I've made my pledge. :D I'm really hoping this turns out nice and gory. We'll reach the goal I'm sure of it. I'm pooping my pants out of excitement and anticipation of this game. Any chance of screenshots being released any time soon? I just pledged. :D Question: 26000 Kilometers and 16 total players? Doesn't this seem a bit one-sided? Why such a large area for so few people? (Or better yet, so few people for such a large area?) Wouldn't be easy to assume that you could play all day on a server and never see another person? Geoff Keene will be appearing on CROSSHAIRS Live gaming podcast Sun @ 3pm est @ crosshairschat.com As we all can tell, the fundings are going to be way beyond 60.000. What are you planning to do with the extra money? Last push ! @$50+K At current rate of funding, I think this can fund in the next 24 hours :D Almost 50k! @Swert Yeah I totally forgot about random gen world, I guess that kills the idea. Now that I think about it though, it might also hurt the exploration aspect, I LOVE exploring. @SaucyemmettC I was so pumped for Project Zomboid and followed it for months, but it just seemed to be going in a direction I didn't like. It seems so heavily focused on just managing personal health stats, like hey you're depressed or bored, take pill or do X to fix it. I feel like things such as boredom should come from me as the real life human player, if I get bored in real life I seek out more things to build, locations to explore. Main things I want in a zombie game are building/fortifying, crafting that progresses, and exploration. I like the idea of progressing and increasing safety that allows more advanced goals. I guess the idea of increasing safety goes directly against Zomboid's theme doesn't it? :) Anyway I think Project Zomboid is great and I have lots of respect for them, just didn't turn out to be what I hoped for. I hope you guys get the funding you need. It looks like you have a great game in the works! I'm extremely excited about this project, and I'm happy to lay down some hard-earned to help you get there. I'm impressed with the speed at which you folks are able to churn out fully rendered content (which is to say, I love the frequent updates) and I appreciate that you're going to make this available to lower-end machines (like mine). Lastly, the fortification option is genius. I love the idea that hard work, creativity and diligence are paid off with security and stability and that the opposite traits are punished with face-eating. Great work, guys and gals, and best of luck. As a huge Stalker fan the only thing I've ever wanted in Stalker was a really well built co-op mode. Not a hack or a user mod, but a co-op mode where the game was built specifically for it. That's what I see in your game here. I'm in, and I'm excited. Yeah david, these guys are fast. On their twitter, forums, here- they respond normally within 10-30 mins. its only been recently they have started to slow. But between the development of this awesome game, and all the extra fans they have flooding their inbox that is understandable :P Thanks for the quick reply! :) they are apparently working on making a pre-alpha video. They have been working on the ENGINE for half a year now, but gameplay is just on the verge (as far as I can tell from their answers to other people/messages on twitter) One can never have too many zombie games, and this one sounds solid. Any chance of at least some gameplay video before the end of the project? I mean, at this stage it's going to fund anyway ( :D ) but extra funding never hurt, right? thanks :) I dont know if this is everyone- But there is this page on their forums. <url>"less realistic" content, more weapons, buildings, actual campaign missions (co-op and single), different apocalypse rules (Nuclear, Flu Strain, comet, war). Granted, this is all out there speculating. But really the sky is the limit, even if we get everything we have been promised. We need better awards.In game item is useless Yes! This is actually looking pretty good so far, 45/60K already! This might be the most awesome game ever. This actually might be the last game I ever play. Unless we're expecting a TDL saga :P Changed my pledge to $100 cant wait for this game!!!! Good luck with the rest of development, greetings from Orem, UT! Saucy my opinionated self says it will be better because of "up to" 16 player co-op. ("Supporting up to at least 16 players in a single world, The Dead Linger can be played solo or with a group of friends watching your back.") Now to make choices where to hold up. Do you want to go to the police station, prison, school, or hospital. Hope its even better than Project Zomboid Both are my dream zombie games PLEASE DONT FAIL US So, you hand us a backpack to get us kickstarted.... B-) I wonder if they plan on including the ability to eventually set up a walled-garden or a hydroponic growing system to help you survive. It should be possible to survive indefinitely on canned goods you scavenge but a meal or trail rations made from fresh food you grow yourself should confer some kind of bonus. While I hate limited inventory space and would like "the kickstarter" for that reason, it also kind of seems like cheating, no? woo! $42k, *inserts obligatory hitchhikers guide to the galaxy reference* /start totally hypothetical post Out of interest, if someone pledged $1000 with the name "Experimental Atomic Powered Raygun" would it become "The "Experimental Atomic Powered Raygun" Update -- with a whole set of items named after Experimental atomic powered rayguns. " because if so, that would be a lolzy way for a scifi nut to get some unrealistic content in. And would be hilarious. /end totally hypothetical post Is there any way we can volunteer you know like do voices or draw stuff or graffiti maybe Easter eggs. Maybe even do hats like TF2, lots and lots of hats. :) I'm backing this because Brandy Chaps and Churches-Peaches are master-crafting some of the most profound musical literature that will ever have been composed, challenging the learned connoisseur while charming the hearts of lay-music lover and enhancing both experiences. I must ensure that, before the world is taken over by zombies, I have done my part to enrich our musical repertoire and better prepare myself for fighting off zombies. @Sandswept Studios Are there going to be large areas between cities? How about small towns? Deserts? Very excited about this game. Just saw it today, and I died. I had to pledge $25. You best be developing this baby fast! :D Glad to say I'm one of the 59 $100 pledges Zombie survival sandbox? Oh hell yeah! I've been waiting a *long* time for this. 9gag sucks, I wouldnt really WANT people who frequent that site to fund this project... @Aske Brink-Vilsen: I would, but I find uploading too much of a pain (not to mention Im a redditor) Someone else can XD (I already did one on reddit) I would recommend someone making a post on the site 9gag.com about this. You upload an image file, and if given people give it a positive vote, houndreds of thousands will see it. It's free and great advertisement for you guys, since hundreds of thousands visit the site daily and nearly every post gets shared on Facebook by tens of thousands. PS: Zombies are very popular on 9gag and this will probably go to the front page if presented well. -Aske almost to 40k! We can do it! @Sandswept Studios: Given the ability to fortify and barricade oneself anywhere you want, does this essentially open up the possibility of NEVER dying; if one was able to barricade that well? Or do you plan on creating inevitable storms / super zombies / natural disasters that will make it impossible to remain in one spot for the entire duration of the game? Oie disregard...Stupid firefox didnt display the image :| HURP DERP! *beats head against desk* Are you guys gonna go on the "kicking it forward" thing? It seems to have helped out alot of other projects ^_^ Woot! 1006! RAWK! Zombie games FTW! Much love and luck everyone ^_^ Just became the 1000th backer. Good luck Sandswept! @ Mike for the moment there isn't going to be any friendly npcs giving out quests (not in the alpha) the "quests" are what you make them to be. For example we have to go raid that warehouse for supplies. They haven't said how many weapons are planned for the game, besides maybe 3 guns and 10 melee weapons when the alpha first comes out and then add more every couple of weeks. Yes you can pick up anything and throw it, but as for actual weapons they are asking for people to make models/concepts and they may include them in the game. The game is going to feature randomly generated maps so there is no designated off the beaten path areas since everyone's maps will be different. Also all my information is coming from what the Design Director Zag has said on the forums. I think a massive variety of melee weapons makes sense given that you can simply grab just about anything and use it for that purpose. Also, being uncontrolled in most countries actual melee weapons should be far more available than firearms. Now, about those guns, there probably shouldn't be a huge variety of them. They should probably be mostly civilian types, hunting types. Maybe a few kickass guns could be out there but rare, maybe in locations that are difficult to access or just hidden in areas well off the beaten path as a reward for exploration. I guess they could also be part of a difficult quest or in the hands of very tough NPCs. If you want to get those weapons from those NPCs you'd have to come up with a clever way of doing so since they'd easily beat you in a straight up fight. Ah, so many ideas that can be thrown around for this game, I love it. @ Siresly , The Dead Linger is only using the kickstarter to allow some of their team to continue working on the game full time. The game was going to get developed whether or not it was funded or not. They are planning on hopefully sometime between April-May, but it's not guaranteed and the kickstarter page says maybe 3-6 months. @ Aske Brink-Vilsen, I don't think you will be able to fully customize your weapons, there has been talk about attaching flashlights and stuff, but nothing solid yet. The game is aiming for a STALKER look but it might eventually look better. The weapons aren't going to be similar to borderlands, they will have a wide variety of guns, some with multiple variations, and there will be a lot of melee weapons. Will you be able to customize your characters and weapons? -That would be cool. also, I'm expecting this to be a lot like Borderlands compared to both graphics and weapons, say the sketchy artwork the game uses and the ridiculous amount of different weapons in the game! Am I way off on this? You can thank Chris O'neill aka OneyNG on Youtube and Newgrounds for my pledge. He gave a shoutout to 400.000 people on Youtube. I don't think I would have know about this project without him. Keep up the good work. -Aske at alpha they start selling the game like minecraft was sold. As far as I was aware this was the point of the kickstarter, getting enough money to push their alpha out so they can find the rest of the project using their profits Say the game reaches alpha state and you run out of Kickstarter money, how will you fund the final stretch of development, and how long do you reckon it'll take from alpha to proper release? Zag, You might want to consider adding the following to the FAQ, just to clarify in the future for people like Alexis: What platform is this releasing on? Windows PC for now, we're hoping to also get some Mac and Linux support out there later on! Your game key will work for all platforms, so you can start playing on the Mac/Linux versions if/when they are released for no additional contribution. Cheers. wow i just got an e-mail from them for bieng the 900 backer i appreciate the personal touch. im also EXCITED about this game. KEEP IT UP! I have a mac, but I couldn't resist backing this project. Will it be possible to save my reward for a mac friendly version? Yeah! over 50%!!! Sorry about the double post but I had to say something. The concept art with instructions on how to make the sharpened rebar on your website cracks me up. I've always wanted an end-of-the-world-scenario game with base building/recruiting/scavenging/action elements all rolled into one. Kind of a Minecraft meets Terraria meets Resident Evil thing. This is close to what I had in mind from the sound of it. The thing that really got me to donate was the random world generation. That and the warm fuzzy feeling of helping a person do something they love. I just wish I had heaps money. I'd spend so much of it on Kickstarter. We get all versions of the game mike, dont worry. We will be able to be a part of the whole development :P When it says you get a copy of the game on release, is that final release only or do we get to try the alpha/beta/etc as well? Sorry if this was already thought of: You guys ever think about adding a competitive game mode to this? Perhaps have a scavenger mode where its four teams of four players each all scavenging for resources like food and water and ammo. Players would have to choose whether they want to stay in a group or split up to leave people behind to defend their building they chose to fortify. Make it so that the winner of the game is the team that holds 70% of the resources or maybe has the most resources in their fortress at the end of the round? Players would have to fight off zombies and other players as they scavenge, steal from other teams, and defend their home base. I think it would be really fun! Sorry for the plug, but my site has got an interview with Sandswept about the game! <url>#pid3391 Keep up the good work, guys! If you want mroe backing esspeccially at alpha stage, go see how wolfire games have done it, producing a videos every 2-3 weeks or once a week sometimes of about 5 mins lenghs to show the latest updates, art assets etc. This gives potential buyers massive confidance in your product and also allows for great feedback from the community. Please consider this or something similar. Your game looks great and if you maybe get a few art assets and maybe even if it's VERY early alpha gameplay it will defiantly encourage more funding. Be much mroe open and support will grow massively. Is this game actually coming out in June (at least in some form aka alpha/beta) or is the estimated delivery not right? That just seems very soon when there's no in-game footage/screens at all. It makes no difference to whether or not I still pledge, I just want to know when I get to play it ;). @Sandswept Well it was an example :P It would be hard if not impossible for you to release this game hard boxed as awesome as that would be. Who wants to wait a couple of YEARS to receive a kickstarter reward... Oh my god, this is one of the two games that I've always dreamed about. can't wait over 50% with plenty of time. Glad to see people are supporting this awesome project! I agree, the more information readily available to us (be it screen-shots or hopefully another video) the easier it'll be to get the project flowing. I've been posting your youtube video on a few different sites and people almost always react the same way: "We need to see how it'll be different from other games and not just an empty promise". They say empty due to lack of footage, I just hope this'll help point you in the right direction. I for one fully support the cause, best of luck in these last 25 days I'm sure you'll more than beat the mark! I'd love to see some more pictures, screens and clarification in general of how the game will work. Maybe a huge FAQ update (as a new KS update) which answers a whole lot of questions asked (here). - Perhaps an update where we can ask the questions which get answered in the following? - Just voicing my support for a Steam version (for the final copy, A/B not needed) - Some more reward levels would never hurt. 150/250/5000 Pledged $1 for now to post. Wrote a post on my site here > <url>"okay, you donate $750, we will send you a disk at alpha, beta, and a large box copy at release" But it would HAVE to be that expensive to make it worth their wild. Eh, I wouldnt worry. If there was enough call for it they may release a boxed limited version for sale on their website upon release. woo 50,11% @Kieron, i see what you saying, didnt think of it that way. doh. but having a boxed version as a momento would still be awesome, and I would have a problem of paying like 50 more for a limited edition big box set. also, woo! 50%! the problem with that michael is, they plan to make this alpha funding. There could be 1-2 gb PATCHES every few months. While they could certainly send a very much final version boxed...That could take years to get finished. But yes, being from australia (while we by no means have it THAT expensive) I do know the reasoning behind a hard box copy. It is the reason I upgraded to 100 for DFA. and if they could promise one, I may even consider it here too. But being alpha funding that is pretty hard. That's why I suggested it as an extra level, pay $X more to get the hard copy. IM BAAAAACK. (Yea, I am crazy, deal with it.) So another question, which I see was previously asked but not answered: the copy of the game from the $25 or up reward level will be digital, yes? Will you consider adding additional levels for a "hard copy"? I ask this firstly, because physicals stuff is awesome, and secondly if you are from somewhere like South Africa, where bandwidth can go for almost $10 per gigabyte, it would maybe be a key 'selling' point. (yes, there are 'unlimited' bandwidth options, but they cost and arm and a leg and a few kidneys). Also, a "Big Box" type release would also be amazing. Cheers. that's awesome, thanks for the quick reply. Oh I see now, so there's no actual 'building' per se, rather just fortifiyng? Just curious. Sorry another question, I searched but couldnt find it. Just how in depth will building/fortifying etc. be? Are we talking literal building some sort of defense from scratch (materials/placement a la minecraft although obviously not cubes), modifiyng in place buildings (moving things, adding ladders, placing planks etc.) or something along the lines of garrys mod? again if unanswerable thats fine. @Sandswept Studios - Yes, yes. I am aware that there will be a WORLD, not just city, mall or a forest. Just glad you guys will look at the project as serious as we (playerbase) would like you to. And I am in no way complaining. Shit I swear to God, if you guys eventually deliver (no need to rush) this game will be legendary in the genre. Just look back on the zombie games - like FPS sub-genre. All of them do things right, but none of them even attempt to be THE ZOMBIE GAME. In recent years all of the genres except for one started "pussyficating" (decline) at expense of quality of graphics vs. features/gameplay depth. So I not only support you financially, I'll try to add some material to the appropriate section in the forums. Thank you Sandswept Studios for even attempting bring us this awesome game. Eagerly waiting for updates. Thanks for the quick response. Considering I have the rights on the name and logo, I could get a release drawn up giving you permission to use it in game. But yea, we can talk about it further down the line. Good luck! I HATE YOU PEOPLE AND YOUR AWESOME PROJECTS. TAKE MY MONEYZ!!! On a serious note, for the "Small piece of game content named after you." reward, would you be able to have a store sign with my company name and logo? Whatever the case, looking forward to it! Cheers. Quick question: will there be a lot of z visual variations ? I mean, like more than five textures on same zombie model ? Would be great to see some variety in the way they look. You know, since you're in a city and all... I've checked the website , forums and answer you gave, and this really seems like you're not being easy on the survival part of the game, this may be the game we've all been waiting for. Question regarding zombies, will they respond to the health system, where shooting them x number of times kills them (headshot multipliers etc) or will there be a system where shooting them in the legs takes the leg off and slows them, or a combination of both? If its unanswerable, thats fine. I really want to see this game made.I just wish I had more money to spend.OhZombies....How I do love to kill some zombies. 50 from me i want this game to live and to experience a true open world zombie game with 100% differ and freedom pledged 25, will pledge more next paycheck. I've been looking forward to this exact type of game for a very long time! I require this game immediately. Thanks Just backed it! Can't wait to get a copy. I'll be doing a write up on my website soon. <url>"action" game. I followed Project Zomboid for a long time and it's a great idea, but it just didn't seem to be going in the direction I wanted, seems to be mainly focused on only basic survival, personal health, not much exploration and building/crafting. It's very focused on realistic difficulty which is cool, but I can't help but want some of that grandeur traditionally found in games. $50 from me too, now go do some work slaves! :) You guys have my $50, hopefully we get a kick ass game out of this! lol notch just backed. AAA developers often make their own engines, or use engines they have already made/bought. As for games made with OGRE, there is one pretty well known game out there, apparently Torchlight was made with it. AAA game engines? lol i don't think thats a thing but hopefully you'll get my point :p LOL, do you really know what it is then? like I said, its a graphic rendering engine, not a game engine, which is why AAA titles don't use it, because they have specific game engines they can use to make their FPS or RTS or whatever A graphics engine can do everything a game engine can do, it just requires more coding and frankly for a game as innovative as this, I want something uniquely coded and not the same package they offer on AAA game engines Yeah I know what it is, and I don't really remember good things being done on it . @Eric its an engine for graphic rendering, as far as a gamer is concerned, graphics should look superb as I personally have seen the lighting, texture, shadows OGRE can make in capable hands keep up the good work Sandswept Studios i have full faith in this game A photoshopped "screen" trying to render what's the game is going to look like. I'm septic about Ogre 3D, can we eventually get a "targeted rendering" screen ? What game engine will this be run on? Just trying to get an idea of how this will look make it better, make it faster IF they show some proper gameplay, and more people begin to belive that this will be epic.. and it goes viral... What would they do with a ton more money then they wanted? yay, over 1/3 of the way there :D @ Justagigolo They have stated that there will be no steam release for the time being. The plan seems to be similar to minecraft in that it will go through alpha, then beta, then to final release. If they decide to release on steam LATER on the other hand, well then they will. But for the alpha and beta testing stages it would be too hard over steam considering they are going for a minecraft style of release. Will this see a Steam release? i just thought it was gonna be a cosmetically awesome piece of tool of some sort, like a "super welder" or something @Steven The Kickstarter will most likely be a backpack. That is based on stuff already released. If that is the case, it wont make you an endless zombie killing machine. Though, I agree with your general assertion, it shouldn't be the "best". I think there should still be some better backpacks to find (rarely) but it should be pretty high up there. I don't want this kickstarter item. It doesnt make sense for the player to start with the best item in the game. Assuming it is a weapon, why would I want to use any other weapon ever, if the kickstarter is better? Just curious, when can we expect to see gameplay footage? Alright, thanks Eric. I'll be keeping an eye on the updates. Michael, for you first question, this is terraria style. for your second I think this will be possible, I don't know how much of it we'll have to, but I guess customization and crafting are part of the game. and for your third question, yes indeed, I think it is . (As they said: Game will be cheaper in alpha) so yeah, totally Alpha Funding project. Marcus, we don't know much about the world gen yet, more to come soon according to devs. I have a few questions for the developers of "The Dead Linger": 1. Will the character data and the world data be saved in the same file (i.e: Minecraft) or saved separately (i.e: Terraria); will I be able to transport my character back and forth between Single Player town and Multiplayer town(s) (which effectively makes the game world truly infinite). 2. Thinking back on "I am Legend", I remember the protagonist constructed a makeshift lab in his safe house; so I was wondering if we will be able to fashion various equipment/facilities just like one would in a zombie apocalypse. (Feel free to skip this question for sake of keeping a suspense/surprise on the project) 3. Will this be a continuous/semi-continuous project like Minecraft? (i.e: released Alpha, Beta, continuous update until completion; also leaves room for possible future update.) I'm sure this has been mentioned somewhere in the "world generator" category but I'm curious. Will the game generate tropical islands? Will there be a weather dynamic? Thanks for your time and effort! Given a previous request for a 64-bit version, I would like to point out there are plenty of 32-bit users out there too. While perhaps a bit late, I would also suggest that OpenGL offers the advantage of being portable to Mac/Linux as well as offering advanced features (like tessellation) across all platforms, which DirectX does not. One suggestion for the pledge rewards, how about offering people the chance to be a zombie? They send a picture of their face (or that of an unsuspecting friend!) and you build a model using it (suitably "enhanced" with zombie cosmetics of course). That add some interest - muhhhhhhhhh..... See I think it is world gen that has us the most worried- But is also the biggest and best reason why this project has to work. A working, detailed city generator- no, COUNTRY generator will be worth a lot, it may even kickstart (heh heh heh I HAD to) a whole new world of possibilities for modding and people making games based on the code. It does indeed, I imagined something like that, also something else i'm afraid of is the world being generated randomly, I think this is great idea for this kind of game, but aren't the environment going to look too generic at sometimes ? Or are we going to see different city "design" , mountain, sea, lakes, forest, survivalism style . ? I'd love walking off a road after looting car, and finding some kind of "lost" village in the forest, with people not being aware of what happened, or something like that . Also boats and air balloons. I'm just confused about the character being able to play on any server, I don't see how that is persistent, if you can't resume in the 25,000km² world you were in ... Think there is a misunderstanding there. So, no persistent world exploration with dynamic spawn etc. Kind of like Minecraft survival mod really. ? Will zombies be able to bash the crap out of your barricades? Is the alpha deal on the dead linger the same as with minecraft? That is, that IF there is ever post launch (after release, not in alpha-beta) DLC or Expansions that it will be free? Personally I hope there IS post launch content (expansion packs, NOT DLC). Since i'm assuming that lots of people will skip this till release, since it does sound too good to be true. Frankly, if you did end up releasing big meaty expansion packs after launch.. that would be great. Don't pull a terraria on us and only release one major post release patch and run away sweet thanks for clearing it up. if it becomes big, and viral, then the big ISP's like internode, iinet and TPG will make their own. SO I wouldnt worry. Or you could just find locals like me who like to play with you :P The site says that we can make our own servers, so im sure it could easily become like minecraft. Just pledged, and I NEVER do this sort of thing. One question, with the servers, will there be any run by Sandswept and external owners? I live in australia, and we always get screwed over by servers over here... So, is the multiplayer going to be persistent ? (Character linked to server) or something else ? How about a 'your likeness as a zombie' reward if that is possible? Maybe even get to record yourself saying 'Braaaaains!' :D I wish this project success! Very excited for this project, keep up the great work guys. Will this have a 64 bit exe version? I really think it is more then needed given the scope of the map and game. Without a 64bit exe it may run a little on the slow side. Don't let me down, just dropped my pledge, I love you guys for even attempting this. You're a true gamer's company, and I'm so excited for release, good luck! :) I'm really excited for this. I've been playing Outerra, which I am curious if SW studios has heard of. It is very much what I am hoping TDL to be, but of course populated with the dead as opposed to Outerra, which is supposed to be empty. I am sure you guys will be successful in this project will this be released in Steam? I love sandbox games. What direct x version will this game be using? 11? Also, what will happen if you get some silly amount like 400,000 dollars or something? I really like the idea of this game! I look forward to seeing how this project turns out!!!!! I can't wait for this, I hate how there's way to many zombie games where the emphasis is on killing zombies and not enough emphasis on actually surviving a zombie apocalypse. This game need to be made and be shown to the world, hopefully everyone else will share my point of view. Backed as hard as I possibly can. yeah, but lan play between the same copy is often frowned upon, good to know I can do it without feeling bad. :P Hell, I may be able to convince some other people to buy it that way. Could I technically have it on both computers in my house, and let people play with me when they come round? (not saying giving it to them, just want to know if two of the same copies can play together) Denotative -_-, meant definite. Just read through some comments, DRM free FTW!. And the no denotative end answer.... brilliant! True survival. Wish I could afford $50, want that in-game item. Went in for $25, is the game DRM free? Can it be installed on more then one computer? i have two main ones in my house, prefer not to be limited to one ^_^. The idea of this game is something I've always wanted to see done. Am going to love spending hundreds of hours in this massive world. Thanks so much for going into this! June is going to take forever to get here now xD. I like zombies, and I like sandbox games, so this is right up my street. Really like the sound of this! I'm in for $25 and might up it if I can swing the extra cash. While I realise that OSX/Linux support might not be your first priority, I really hope that it's something you'll be able to achieve down the line. @Sean I agree with you 100% on DRM and have never purchased (and never intend to) a game requiring online activation so EA, Ubisoft, Activision, 2KGames, etc have all gone on my boycott list (aside from the occasional GOG release). The money saved is instead going to projects like this and DRM-free vendors like GOG, HumbleBundle and IndieRoyale. Having said that, I'm going to have to limit the time I spend on Kickstarter - it's becoming an expensive habit... For some reason I can never read the title of this game correctly... :P I blame TF2 for that (even though I don't play it anymore). - I keep reading "Linger" as if it's pronounced more like "The Dead Ringer" yes, exactly like that :o You really should point out your forums/website more. It took me awhile to really explore it as much, but reading it made me feel much more "safer" in pledging towards you. Thank you for the quick response. Could you expand your answer on the first question please? Examples? Sub-objectives? If there's no end or way to win the game it does sound like a MMO "styled" game. I hope they would make a campaign map mode, with support for custom stories, (on pre-randomised maps perhaps?) and then sandbox sprawling awesomeness, While I am still sceptical over this project (it sounds too good to be true), I hope it all works out. If they do plan on taking user content, I think i'll try to write a bunch of journal entries and wall messages lol I pledged but have a few questions: 1) With a randomly generated world will there still be objectives/ quests/ story line in the game? 2) You're not trying to go the MMO route I hope? 3) Can you "win" the game or is this just kill, kill, kill to rack up points/ achievements ala Valve's L4D? Thanks for any answers you can provide. You should "kick it forward" may get you some more marketing, that and its a good cause. <url>
