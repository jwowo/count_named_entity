Dear backers, This has been a long time coming, but we have finally done a redesign of the Canary website to include a "wall of thanks": <url>– my family, my husband, Omar's family, old friends from high school, college, grad school (I think fully half the Harvard Department of Government donated!). TED Fellows and TEDsters, friends I met in Beijing, friends I met at Global Voices. People from every moment in my life that has mattered. Omar's old friends from Stuyvesant, Stanford, New York. I missed so many names in the hectic pace that was that campaign. I wish I could say, individually, to every single one of you, thank you. I am so deeply moved all over again. Living with this disease has been this constant process of grieving for my old life, of saying goodbye to myself. Reading these names has helped me to feel connected and supported all over again. As morbid or elegiac as it sounds, I mean it joyfully and with gratitude – what a fierce and wonderful life I lived from birth to 28, and how many incredible people I have met along the way. And then I started seeing names that I would never have recognized during the campaign. Names of patients and activists, caretakers, family and friends, of people that I would only come to know later. And then I saw Walter Irvine – he and his wife, Chardale, gave. Chardale took her own life last year after many long years of battling this disease. I saw Vanessa Li, who fought so hard for herself and for all of us, before she also took her life last year. I am angry for what we have lost. I am angry for the unnecessary pain caused by ignorance and prejudice. There are times I feel we face terrifying odds but then I remember we are not the first and we are not alone. We can take inspiration from the struggles and successes of other movements. We fought against the invisible We looked to one another for comfort We held the hands of friends and lovers We did not turn our backs We embraced We embraced – E. Ethelbert Miller, 2005 I am so grateful to this amazing list – for reminding me of just what we are fighting for and the amazing things that can happen when we all come together. With love and gratitude, Jen Note: as of fall 2015, we are only using Kickstarter to send out updates about rewards and other campaign-related news. For news about the film, all backers have been added to the Mailchimp email list. For more, see our FAQ . This September CANARY is heading to IFP Independent Film Week at the Lincoln Center in New York. IFP's forum is one of the largest connecting new documentary feature projects with U.S. and International buyers, sales agents, and financiers. We can't wait to continue the conversations we started at Sundance and hopefully make some new friends for the film! You can read the full press release here: <url>#.VbAQ3JNVhBd I am thrilled to announce that Canary in a Coal Mine has been chosen as one of eight films to participate in Britdoc's Good Pitch New York!!! "Good Pitch brings together documentary filmmakers with foundations, NGOs, campaigners, philanthropists, policy makers, brands and media around leading social and environmental issues - to forge coalitions and campaigns that are good for all these partners, good for the films and good for society." BRITDOC is all about helping documentaries achieve the broadest reach and greatest impact on the world. We are so excited to have the opportunity these next many months to work with them on developing a killer outreach campaign and expanding our circle of allies. You can see the full lineup of Good Pitch New York films here: <url>‪#‎mecfs‬ community and find new allies and audiences: <url>– it's the midway point! We capped off the week with an editing workshop where we showed some work-in-progress scenes from CANARY. It is early days, but it was the perfect setting and the perfect moment to get that outside feedback. In short, the room encouraged and empowered me to return to the deepest roots of why I decided to embark on this crazy journey of filmmaking to begin with; to remember what it felt like to believe that I didn't have a choice, that I needed to tell this story to save my own life. Sundance / Women in Film Financing Workshop In April, in Albuquerque, I boarded a plane to Los Angeles – by myself. It is my first solo travel in over four years. It was risky and a little scary, but mostly in that got the keys to my mom's car for the first time kind of way. I am ever grateful for airport wheelchair attendants who help enable disabled persons to travel independently, for UberX, and for all of the little tricks I have learned (and keep learning) that make possible minor miracles such as this trip. Lindsey and I were at a Female Filmmakers Initiative Financing Intensive hosted by the Sundance / Women in Film LA to strategize how to effectively close our budget gap for post-production. It's a big mountain to climb, but I've come to realize both this illness and documentary filmmaking itself are the business of climbing mountains. Our main dilemma (and opportunity) is how to make sure even more people know about this film, especially those who care deeply about the issues at the heart of this story: issues of science, healthcare, gender, disability, discrimination and patients' rights. CANARY is in post-production! At Sundance in January, I saw this extraordinary film by Marc Silver, 3 1/2 minutes. 3 1/2 minutes tells the story of the tragic shooting of Jordan Davis, a black teen who was killed by a white man in Florida over a disagreement about loud hip-hop music. It won a Special Jury prize and airs on HBO this fall. I am pleased to announce that 3 1/2 minutes's very talented editor, Emiliano Battista, is the latest addition to Team Canary. Please give him a big welcome! More on 3 1/2 minutes: <url>½ Minutes (Special Jury Prize Sundance 2015, HBO), How is your Fish Today? with Chinese novelist and film-maker Xiaolu Guo (Sundance 2007), The Intimacy of Strangers, The Solitary Life of Cranes, Black Out and Night, Peace with Eva Weber, Elvis Pelvis (Berlin Film Festival), Dolce Vita Africana, a portrait of Malian photographer Malik Sidibe, The Runner by Saeed Taji Farouky and The Auction House, a tale of two brothers about the oldest auction house in India. Emiliano has also worked on multi-screen art installations shown in major exhibitions and museums worldwide: All That is Solid Melts into Air and No Permanent Address with Mark Boulos. More soon! Now that you're all caught up, we have some more good news coming your way soon! Hi everyone! I will be appearing Monday morning live at 10am ET/7am PT on the national NPR show, On Point along with Dr. Ellen Wright Clayton, chair of the IOM committee, Dr. Derek Enlander of Mt. Sinai and Dr. Daniel Neides of the Cleveland Clinic. The show will discuss Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and the new name and definition for Systemic Intolerance Disease (SEID). I will also talk a bit about the film. It is a one hour, live call in show, so you can call in with your questions or comments during the broadcast. Here is how to call on point: <url>…/510053/on-point-with-tom-ashbrook Wish me luck! Jen Greetings everyone! We have been back from Park City for over a week but it's taken me awhile to muster the brain power to write this update. Sundance was one of the most extraordinary experiences of my life. You have a real sense, being there, that movies matter; that documentaries matter; and that the right story, told the right way, at the right moment can change everything about how a society sees a person, a place, or entire class of people. They are perhaps our culture's most powerful empathy machines. I am doing everything I can to make this film that story, The entire Canary team walked away from all the workshops and screenings with an even more ambitious vision of what the film and the space around it might be. We had the opportunity to share our work in progress footage with broadcasters, funders, and creative and strategic partners from around the world. The meetings were incredible. So many had personal connections to the subject of the film – friends or loved ones with ME or other complex or invisible illnesses, who had lived similar stories. One of the most compelling facts about this project has been, and continues to be, just how much support this film garnered on Kickstarter. It is our most powerful indicator of what the audience for this film might be. So thank you, as ever, for being the first to believe in this dream. Below, a bit of Sundance, in pictures! With gratitude, Jen I took some aggressive pre-Sundance rest in my DIY sensory deprivation chamber Before a nine hour road trip (!) Then pumped up on some saline at an infusion center in Salt Lake City I missed the DJ spinning at the opening night party, but it looks like it was fun! With some aggressive activity management (Don't worry – I am not crashing in this photo. I am aggressively pacing and taking up all of the space that I need.) And a little help from some friends... ...I made it to nearly every event! My profound thanks to two of our lovely producers, Lindsey Dryden and Patricia Gillespie, without whom getting out of this week alive would never have been possible. And to the film's first producer, my husband, Omar, who kinda holds up the universe with his bare hands. I am thrilled to announce that I have been invited to attend the Sundance Film Festival in January as one of ten Documentary Film Program fellows! Just to be clear, Canary is not in the festival (we have not yet even begun our edit). But what this does mean is that I and a few members of my team will have the opportunity to participate in a week of workshops culminating in "industry meetings": curated, one-on-one meetings with broadcasters, distributors, funders and creatives. It is an extraordinary opportunity to get the word out about our ME documentary to a community of individuals and organizations who support documentary filmmakers and help films find their audiences. It will be nine, grueling days. I know it will be costly but I cannot think of anything more worth the effort. I have been largely bedridden again since our California shoot, although the last few days I am finally starting to feel pretty good. I will be resting aggressively the next four weeks in preparation. I could use your thoughts and prayers. If between now and the last week in January, every so often you could tweet me, or Facebook me and say, "Jen, REST," that would be enormously helpful. But seriously, how amazing is this? <url>’ve supported have gone on to win Emmy® awards, Academy Awards®, Peabodys, and The Ridenhour Documentary Film Prize; and they have gone on to change hearts, minds, and policy. YOU CAN THANK Chicken &amp; Egg for supporting our stories here: <url>– beautiful, terrifying, heartbreaking, joyous, and lovely. In other words, what I believe is a picture of all of our lives, whether or not we have ME. The #MEAction Network Lastly, I wanted to share news about a new platform currently under development, one with a set of tools that will make it easier for advocates from around the world to meet, collaborate, and join campaigns to promote equal access to healthcare, science, and basic human dignity for patients living with ME. It's called The #MEAction Network . We're not an advocacy organization. Rather, we aim to empower a grassroots movement with tools and resources that help advocates do what they are already doing, better. Sign up here: <url>– Myalgic Encephalomyelitis for one person, Parkinson's for another – a common set of causes may be increasing our risk. <url>– and limits – of the AIDS movement as a model for other health movements.

The M.E./Canary in a Coal Mine segment on Al Jazeera's America Tonight is now live online.

THANK YOU!! You've helped turn the worst thing into the most extraordinary, wonderful thing. <url>"Give a little more, help us get to $190,000" and you were like, "Nah, Jen. We're going to go ALL THE WAY." As of the moment I type, we have raised $198,764 of our $200,000 goal. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!! Folks dug into their grocery money, tweeted like mad (yes you, @batteroldbook ), donated their birthdays, and sacrificed an incredible amount for this dream: that the truth of what we live might finally be seen and heard. When I look at this number, I am both amazed and devastated. On the one hand, it's a testament to how powerful, as a community, we can be and on the other, a statement of just how much we have suffered. I am so glad, that with this campaign and this film (and all the other crazy plans we are hatching), we might be able to take all that bad and invert it into something amazing. In fact, I think we already have! We are not going to hit 6509 (that crown is worn by Bridegroom and I am more than happy to let them keep it!). We are, however, poised to enter into the top 20 of documentaries on Kickstarter in terms of both backers and funding. I am so proud to be part of this community! And a BIG BIG thank you to our #MEallies – along with patients, our friends and family, as did folks who have no direct connection to this disease, but recognize in this an all too common story. HUFFINGTON POST We have a new piece up on Huffington Post, which is now featured on the website's home page: <url>– but we need your help spreading the word. Tuesday Thunderclap + Stephen Fry = 7.68 million social reach We've had a tremendous response to our Thunderclap ( <url>’ve shared . Thanks to that support, we’ve raised a tremendous fraction of our budget through the power of the crowd, far more than we ever imagined. At $159,417, and with one week left, we are in striking distance of our goal! We just wanted to answer some questions about our budget. Even when we were aiming for our first $50,000, some wondered why we needed even that much to make a feature-length film. Why are we now shooting for four times that goal? Good questions, all. So, we thought we’d share with you some examples of recent successful documentaries and what they cost to produce, as well as how the funds you have helped us raise will be used in support of this film. $200,000 is a big number in our lives and in the world of Kickstarter. However, in the world of professional, feature-length documentaries, it is a realistic but modest budget. Some sample budgets of documentary films that have played at top festivals and gone on to have theatrical, TV, and online releases: Under Our Skin (Lyme disease documentary) - just under $1 million 5 Broken Cameras - $250,000 (Oscar nominee) - (shot using mostly home-video footage) The Invisible War - $850,000 (Oscar nominee) A Small Act - under $500,000 The Gatekeepers - 1.5 million euros (Oscar nominee) Searching for Sugarman - $1 million (Oscar nominee) Inside Job - $2 million (Oscar nominee) Is it possible to make an excellent film for much less? Of course. And that’s what we’re trying to do! Here is what our film will cost: Production: $120,000 This money covers upgrading to a better camera that can more beautifully capture images in near darkness, allowing us to film our most severely afflicted interview subjects who cannot tolerate light. As an added bonus, the film will also have an overall higher-quality look when shown on large formats (theaters!). It will cover the cost of travel and lodging so we can shoot on location in the US and several other countries, in addition to hiring professional sound recordists and camera assistants, shooting permits, insurance, and meals for the crew. Post-Production: $80,000 This will cover hiring an editor, doing a final color correction, sound design and mix, music rights, and making a film print for festival screenings. Did you know that a single 35mm print, which many top festivals and some theaters still require, costs, at minimum, $30,000? Why are you try to raise so much on Kickstarter? The more we can raise now, the more energy we have to focus on craft, the faster we can finish the film, and the less energy we will need to spend on fundraising in the future. And as I'm sure you can appreciate, for Jen, the more energy saved, the better! What happens if you raise more than your goal? For starters, Kickstarter and Amazon payments will take about 7-10% of what we've raised, and fulfilling rewards does carry some costs. The short answer is, within reason, more money will help us get to an even better film. It means being able to shoot for more days, get even better footage, or the power to work with even more talented and experienced folks. What if you don’t raise everything on Kickstarter? We have many applications out for grants. We will keep pounding the pavement. And one way, or another, we will get to where we’re going. Got more questions? Ask away! Thank you so much for your continued support of our bid to make M.E. visible, to help push history forward a little faster. With gratitude, Jen &amp; Kiran TEN DAYS TO GO! KICK OFF OUR LAST WEEK WITH A THUNDERCLAP We are organizing a Thunderclap to energize the last week of our Kickstarter campaign, and we need your help! You can read more and sign up here: <url>"bag men" out there who whipped the vote across Facebook and Twitter. We continue to be deeply moved by the generosity and enthusiasm of this community of people with #ME and #MEallies. We are a force to be reckoned with! As project of the week, we'll get a chance to chat with the lovely folks over at SnagFilms, and a shot at winning Project of the Month. If we win Project of the Month, we'll get to discuss Canary in a Coal Mine with the head of documentary programming at the Tribeca Film Festival, which would be a pretty great opportunity. Project of the Month voting will open at the end of November/beginning of December. <url>"Shoot Your Story" award is now available in Melbourne, thanks to the generosity of Daniel Kerr and his sister, Anna Kerr. Daniel is a filmmaker and editor, and his sister Anna, in addition to being ill with ME for the last several years, coined one of my favorite expressions yet to come out of this campaign: We're trying to take that revolution international. If you live in or near Melbourne (New York, Los Angeles or London), are well enough to travel to a studio, and would like to tell your story, there are three ways to make this happen: 1) Donate $1200 to our Kickstarter campaign <url>"Shoot Your Story" award. 2) Get a chance to shoot your story for $1 by helping us spread the word: <url>#MEallies to do steps 1 &amp; 2 Recruit 10, and you'll get a Behind the Scenes Pass (access to a private account where you'll be the first to see new video, rough cuts, and updates from the road), a chance to earn invites to screenings, and a shot at telling your story on camera (now, in NY, LA or London), for free. It's our way of saying thank you for spreading the word. Yesterday, Canary in a Coal Mine was chosen as indieWIRE's project of the day. We are now up for project of the week, and WE NEED YOUR VOTE to win. Voting runs now to Monday, 11AM ET. <url>"Shoot Your Story" reward is now available in three cities: Los Angeles, New York, and London, thanks to the generosity of one awesome angel &amp; #MEAlly. <url>“invisibility” and every new donor (even $1!) helps us get closer to producing the full film. With your help, the Kickstarter campaign itself can be a vehicle for raising awareness about ME. With love and gratitude, Jen &amp; Kiran fb.com/canaryfilm twitter.com/canaryfilm We are thrilled to announce that ABCnews.com has a new piece about Canary in a Coal Mine and the realities of life with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis. It features interviews with Jennifer Brea, Nancy Klimas, and Jessica Taylor. At the heart of this project is a belief in the unique power of film and media to bring to light the stories of people with otherwise invisible illnesses. This is one of the rare times that Myalgic Encephalomyelitis has been portrayed in American media with that name and with an unblinking focus on how severe this disease can be for many. Article: <url>“What's fascinating about the film is the most difficult thing to get across to the medical community is how serious this disease is.” Together, we can make that change in the world. With your support and generosity, we have raised over $90,000 and are within striking distance of raising $100,000 by tomorrow (Friday)—just ten days after the launch of our campaign. Thank you again for bringing us so far, so fast! With love and gratitude, Jen &amp; Kiran Thank you so much for all you have given to this campaign. You've blown us away! You have inspired us to push harder, dream bigger. OUR GOAL: 6509 backers by November 22nd That number would make us the most-backed documentary film in the history of Kickstarter. It only takes $1 to become a backer. Our numbers are the biggest argument we can make against the idea that we are "invisible." We may not be out walking around in the world, and if we are, you might not be able to see how we are broken, but we--and the people who love us--can certainly make our presence known! <url>"Chronic fatigue syndrome") forever. Become an #MEally. Recruit your friends and loved ones to become $1 backers. With love and gratitude, Jen &amp; Kiran WE DID IT!! In just 3 days and 5 hours, we have zoomed past our first Kickstarter goal, raising more than $50,000 for Canary in a Coal Mine . You have absolutely knocked us over with all of your love and support (in Jen's case, literally). When the news came in, we got a little emotional: Words cannot equal our gratitude for your generosity. This campaign has invigorated a community that has for so long felt its voices marginalized and ignored. The power and the energy behind this campaign is extraordinary. This is our moment. We are going to do everything we can to tell this message from bigger and bigger platforms, and to make a film that is worthy of the trust you have put in us and the love you have showed. You have inspired us to push harder, to dream bigger. OUR GOAL: $200,000 and 6509 backers by November 22nd We will explain more about this on Monday, but here's our big crazy vision: to raise our *entire* film budget with this campaign, and to be the documentary film with the greatest number of backers in the history of Kickstarter. It only takes $1 to write a new story and change the future. Why 6509 backers? Because we want to win with overwhelming force. That number would put us one man or one woman ahead of the standing record. Whether we're pitching to journalists or courting distributors, we want incontrovertible proof that yes, we exist, we are numerous, and so are the people who love us. There is a passionate audience that wants to see this story told. How do we get there? Share, share, SHARE . Much love and more soon, Jen &amp; Kiran #seeME #MEally Dear #canaries, #spoonies, #MEAllies and everyone who has supported and shared this project: We have raised over $20,000 in the less than 24 hours since our Kickstarter campaign launched yesterday! You have left us humbled, grateful, and (almost) speechless. And as you've shared your stories with us, and what this film means to you...let's just say, I probably cried five times yesterday, and we still have 30 days to go. $50,000 gets us to a film that we're proud of. But if we want a shot at making a film that will change the way the world see M.E.--forever--we've got to aim for a professional, feature-length documentary film budget. But first, let's get to $50K! How do we do that? Share, share, share! <url>
