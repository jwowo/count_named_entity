Wow! Thank you backers for all your support. Who knew the Dot would be so wildly popular?! From the team here at So Special Labs, we wanted to extend our thanks, and stay as transparent as possible with the community throughout the entire process. Together, we can make Dot a realty. We're considering Dot to not just be Crowdfunding campaign, but also a Crowdsourcing campaign. Meaning, with your comments and feedback, we can build a better product together. However mild or wild, post in the comments section what you think; we're reading everything! However, it's going to get harder and harder to respond to every single comment, so we're going to use the FAQ and Campaign Updates section to communicate accordingly with our backers. Digital Trends Review "The most promising we've seen yet". We sent 1 prototype real working sample to the team at Digital Trends and they loved it! Check it out here: <url>
