Hi everyone, Today we've expanded our collection of t-shirts from 6 to 117, and added full-color options to the mix. We've also introduced our new line of tote bags , and dropped our color poster prices by 25%. The Litographs.com you see today is what I was dreaming of when I launched this Kickstarter campaign last November. It's no exaggeration to say that this would have been impossible without your help. So thank you again, and enjoy browsing the new store! - Danny Hi everyone, I've been hearing reports from happy customers who have received their t-shirts today and yesterday. We're still working on shipping this first wave of orders (over 2,000 shirts ordered this week!), so if you haven't heard from us yet with a shipping confirmation you will soon. I can't tell you how amazing it feels to see the photos start rolling in. We've accomplished a ton in the last 3 months, and couldn't have done it without you. Litographs will continue to grow and evolve, and I hope you'll keep in touch. This will be my last update on Kickstarter, but I would love if you would sign up for our newsletter. I send out coupons for $10 off each new release, and it's also the first place I announce new products, giveaways, and campaigns. You can sign up at this link: <url>"Kickstarter shipping" option. + Speaking of gift codes, the second batch of digital and physical gift certificates will go out on 1/17. Everybody who responded to the survey before 12/17 has already received a digital gift certificate. If you responded after 12/17, or if you responded before then but chose the "not in a hurry" option for physical gift certificates, yours will go out on 1/17. Thanks! - Danny Hi Everyone, The digital gift certificates all went out Tuesday night. If you chose a flatbed poster, screen print, t-shirt, XL poster, or framed screen print as your reward you should now have a code that you can redeem on Litographs.com . If you did not receive your code(s) and you think you should have, please send me a message. For the most part everything seemed to work perfectly, but this was a lot to coordinate and I'm sure I made a few mistakes. For all other reward tiers, I'll be getting in touch with you directly in January. Flatbed printed posters are available today on Litographs.com , and all other rewards will become available in January. We're still on schedule to release everything next month, and I'll send you a message the day your reward is added to the site. If you sent a gift certificate directly to a friend or family member, you might want to let them know that their reward will be available next month. Next time you hear from me I'll be reporting from Sharprint's headquarters in Chicago. I'll be sure to take lots of photos of the t-shirts rolling off the press. I can't wait. Thanks again for your support, and Happy Holidays! Danny All the gift certificates that need to arrive by 12/24 are on their way, and the codes and digital gift certificates are almost ready to go. My goal is to have those out to you by the end of the night on Tuesday, at the very latest. I'll include detailed instructions on how to redeem your code then. The gift certificates look awesome . I can't wait for you to see them. - Danny Hi Everyone, It's been quite a campaign! We're at over 600% of our goal, and I've been blown away by the kindness and generosity of everyone who's supported us, and particularly those who have reached out with compliments and suggestions. I'll need your help to make sure that I can mail out the gift certificates quickly. As soon as the campaign ends tomorrow night, I'll be sending out a survey. In the survey, I'll ask for your address and whether you're planning on giving the certificate as a Christmas gift. I'm going to be working non-stop to get these out, but I'd like to prioritize the gifts that are on a tight deadline. So I'd really appreciate it if everyone could be honest, and if those of you who can afford to wait a few days indicate as much. I don't have any last-minute stretch goals to announce -- mailing out these 2,500+ gift certificates is enough to keep me busy for now! -- but I do think it would be pretty awesome if we could hit $100,000. It would take our biggest day yet, but I think it's actually feasible if everyone shares the campaign with a few friends tomorrow. What do you think? In any case, thank you for supporting me, and it's been so great meeting those of you who have introduced yourselves! I can't wait to get these printed. Come January, we'll have an army of literary fashionistas taking over cities across the world. I think that's pretty awesome. - Danny Hi everyone! I have two exciting announcements to share. 1. I've finished mocking up the t-shirt designs for Peter Pan and Sherlock Holmes. Rather than having an additional vote between these two designs, I'm going to keep the original vote running until the end of the campaign, and I'll choose the top two designs at that point. 2. Some of you may know that Litographs donates one book to a community in need for each poster we sell, through the International Book Bank. We've partnered with the IBB since the day we launched, and our customers have helped send almost 10,000 new, high-quality books overseas. Last year, the IBB launched an experimental project to publish children's books in the mother tongue languages of developing countries. In some communities, the national language that is taught in schools is different from the mother tongue language that families speak at home. Children who are only exposed to a national language at school struggle to learn the skill of reading in that language -- one they only hear a few hours a day. Oftentimes schools in developing countries lack books and other resources, even in the national language. Rarely will children have access to books that are written in the languages the children speak. The project was a resounding success, and an amazing fit for the Litographs mission. Today, I'm excited to share that Kate Joyce, the former Executive Director of the IBB, is announcing a new organization called Mother Tongue Books that will grow the project into a movement. Beginning today, each Litographs purchase will donate the cost of binding and stitching one children's book translated into the mother tongue language of a developing country. Thanks to you, this Kickstarter campaign means that over 1,500 communities in need will receive a new, beautifully-illustrated children's book. I've worked closely with Kate over the past year, and I've been blown away by what she was able to accomplish at the IBB. I'm looking forward to taking an even more active role in the Mother Tongue Books organization, and sharing their progress with you. Thanks, Danny Hi everyone, Happy Thanksgiving! I haven't forgotten about the voting deadline for the 5th t-shirt design. As of this moment, Sherlock Holmes and Peter Pan are neck and neck: only 10 votes separate them, out of a total of more than 17,000 votes. What I'm going to do is get to work on mocking up each of them as a t-shirt, and once they're posted we'll hold a runoff vote between the two of them. It's just too close to call at the moment, and I think it will help to see how they'll end up looking (kudos to backer Griffin Patterson for the idea). The losing design will still be in the running for our 6th t-shirt, which you can continue to vote on until the end of the campaign. If you're in the US, I hope you enjoy the holiday. I'll be in touch early next week. - Danny P.S. I've added some more photos, with links to full-size, high-res versions so you can see some more detail. Enjoy! Photo 1 , Photo 2 , Photo 3 , Photo 4 , Photo 5 , Photo 6 Wow. Less than one week in and we're already at 200% of our goal. All I can say is that I'm so thankful to all of you for your support, and for making this a reality. I can't wait to get the final designs to Sharprint and Screwball and watch them work their magic. And I'm so excited to start seeing these shirts and prints in the wild. Thank you. To celebrate, I have a few exciting announcements. 1. A 6th T-shirt Over 6,000 of you have cast your vote for which Litograph should be the next t-shirt and screen print. On Wednesday morning at 11am EST, I'll choose whichever design has the most votes and commit to printing it as our 5th t-shirt and screen print. At the end of the campaign, I'll choose the design with the most votes at that point and make it the 6th. The current top 3 designs are: Peter Pan (961 votes) The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (935 votes) Pride and Prejudice (704 votes) If you haven't voted yet, you still have a few days. Click here to cast your vote, and good luck campaigning to your friends! 2. Litographs for Independent Authors A number of independent authors have reached out to me this week about having their work turned into Litographs. One of the early highlights of this campaign has been working with them to find a way to make it happen. If you're an author (or friend of an author), I'm happy to announce a new reward tier for a custom Litograph of your own work. You, me and a professional artist will work together to design your Litograph, and I'll mail you 5 flatbed printed posters of the finished product. I'm offering 5 early-bird packages at $150, to be shipped in January. If that tier sells out, there will be an unlimited number of $200 packages that will ship in February. After the initial 5 posters, the design will be made available to you at wholesale prices so that you can connect directly with your readers. This is an experiment, and I'm excited to see how it turns out. 3. More Screen Print Sets The signed, limited-edition sets of all 5 screen prints sold out in just a few days. For those of you who missed out, I'm adding another tier at the same $200 level which also includes a first-edition set of 5 screen prints, but will not be the limited, signed editions. Thanks again - let's see how big we can make this! - Danny
