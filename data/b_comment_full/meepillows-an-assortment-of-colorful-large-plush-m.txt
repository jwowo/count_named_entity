What's the address to pre-order the orange? Also, please consider teal as a new color - it'll look great on my couch.... :) Glad to see you are expanding the colour range, as soon as you get to Pink let me know :) My Meepillow finally arrived in Italy today! It's fantastic, thank you! LOL of course the one day I dont go to the po box. Thank you for checking sir I will go out tomorrow and rescue him from the postal service. Just some feedback: Love my set of Meepillows. I am sure my boardgaming friends will love them when I surprise them with their gift. The email I received from the dispatches with my attached invoice I was unable to open on any software on my computer. I have a Mac and tried a few versions of different software to no avail. Also one of my parcels had a huge Lithium Battery sticker on the side suggesting my parcel contained batteries so I am no sure whether this may have slowed the process down of delivery. Once again a huge thank you! I love them. Last info I received on 12/27 was my purple meepillow is in the USA at the sorting center! I keeping checking daily but no movement from the sorting center :-( Anyway, I see others have received theirs , so hopefully the lil guy will arrive soon. Then I get to ship him to my eldest :-) poor guy is going to be tired by the time he arrives at his final destination...lol Hello, My childrens have (finally!) received their meepillows yesterday! They are VERY HAPPY!! (me too!) Thanks ! My final guy arrived today, I now I just need to have friends come over to show them off. Received my two meepillows today. Very happy with them! For others who haven't received theirs yet, take heart.....I never received a tracking email. Last info I received on 12/25 was my purple meepillow is in the USA at the sorting center! I hope it arrives this week! My pillow came last Thursday! Yay! Meeple the Dog loves his new pillow friend! Nothing in Ireland yet and that tracking website is almost incomprehensible. When I've managed to get it to work it tells me it's still in China. Mine came in the mail today! Thanks a lot! Quite pleased with the outcome. The only complain I have so far, is that the tag on my blue meepillow, says "Yellow Meepillow" Nothing received yet (notification or pillows!), I'm in the UK - @Top Shelf Fun - is there a way to check mine are on route? I am having flashes of Toy Story 2 where all those packages where zooming around the airport but the one I'm looking for is nowhere to be seen. 5 of my 6 have shown up in the Burgh of the Pitts. but Yellow is still lost in the void that is the sorting center. Received it yesterday on the 31th. Great timing. The kids love them. Good service and quality. I may or may not have a meepillow (or 2) in the UK. Apparently there's a parcel for me at the office, but asking for package details from my coworkers got nowhere. Also that I never got a tracking email. First day back is this coming Monday, so firm updates then. But I also do like the idea of a Schroedinger's Meepillow. Just thought you needed that mental image. Mine arrived in Australia today and they're amazing. The last of my 5 Meepillows showed up today here in North Dakota! Thanks so much for your hard work on this project. My kids and wife love their new Meepillows! My green one arrived in Finland today! They arrived, and they're beautiful! I have to post them to my friends because I missed Christmas, but at least they're here. Thanks. So I have only received 1 of the 6 Meepillows I ordered so far. It came about 2 weeks ago before we went out of town and I assumed the rest would be waiting for me when we got home yesterday. Only got one shipping email so far and I guess it was for that one. Should I just keep waiting, or do you think there's an issue? Have any US backer received theirs yet? Mine arrived today in the UK which was a MASSIVE relief. Eventhough they arrived today I have to admit that the tracking wasn't that brilliant. The link to the chinese depot said it had left the depot and then never updated. The Royal Mail (postal service in the UK) link I received kept saying the tracking number was invalid. The Meepillows look (and feel) great though :) My and my girlfriends turned up this morning in the UK, great Christmas surprise :) Mine are stuck in China at the sorting centre too. Sad as I wanted them to be a Christmas present. Not to make more work for you but could we have a Christmas certificate or something? I have received the green meeple out of my 6, hopefully the rest come soon. All my meeple have safely arrived by DPD today! Hello, I did not receive my meepillows and i did not receive any news about them... I am very sad because it 's for christmas for my children... What can i do ? Yeah, both of mine are still at the sorting center in China still it seems. They have been there for quite a few days. Three of six received, all yellow which is good as that's the yellows done. Are they shipping in colours separately? I received 2 (red and green) of my 6 six days ago, but no sign of the others yet. Any idea where they might be? both of mine are stuck on "arrival at sorting center." they have been since the 15th. i got the emails on the 10th and 11th. Mine is stuck at "Arrival at Sorting Center", too. @creator - I sent you a message regarding the shipping status of my orders, but I received the important one in the mail today (the green one). That's a Christmas present. The other one is for me, so there's no immediate concern there. I'll live if I get it after Christmas. My red meepillow arrived today. My purple meepillow still shows it's at the sorting facility in China. Hope it's not lost! :) I wish I knew where my orders are - for the last 4 days it has said "Arrival at Sorting Center". I am growing more afraid my kids will have a Meepillow-less Christmas. If the average is 7-10 days, I'm bummed that mine are taking longer. I got the notices for both of mine on 12/10 &12/11 but the 12/10 says it is still in China while the other hasn't moved from NYC since Saturday. Oh well. Can't wait to meet them! @creator: the last shipping updates that I see are "Broken down in orders and handed over to final carrier" and "Handed over to final carrier" in Amsterdam on December 17th. That's 5 days ago, and there haven't been new updates on SFC website since. Is there a way to check for further updates please? No new tracking info since "arrival at sorting center". Now that's just teasing, lol. I had received my tacking info on the 18th but it seems to be wrong. Royal mail doesn't seem to recognise the number. I'm holding out for a today or tomorrow delivery though. I need to get it wrapped. ï¿½ Is there a way to find out what our guess was for the contest? I literally have no idea what I guessed since it was so long ago... Received one of two so far in California. The wife is loving it as it was her color that arrived. I have not received my tracking information either. I have checked my spam filter but there is nothing fitting the guidance from the last update. Please send me an update as these were supposed to be Christmas gifts. @Mark, when did yours ship? Mine shipped out in the 18th and I'm hoping it arrives before Christmas... Wondered if it's possible to order more? Received two of three in separate packaging (California). Arrived! (in Scotland). One red, one blue. My wife and I are very pleased with them, thank you! No tracking email received yet i'm hoping I don't get one and my meepillow turns up like a few others. the person whose xmas present this is is going to love it! wish I got an extra one for me now. My pillows are on their way! My pesky spam filter ate up the emails telling me, but I was able to find them. Can't wait for them to arrive :) Status update... I just had a knock on the door 10 minutes ago and was presented with a very light box, instantly knew it was the Meepillows from it being light and not making a sound when shaken (hope I didn't disturb the little guys from their slumber). The box was just the right size for my three Meepillows (red, yellow and blue), they were packed in just tight enough to keep everything still but not so much that they'd get absolutely squashed. Each one inside an air-tight plastic pouch so they were safe from the constant rainy weather here in the UK. Quality of the Meepillows themselves is very high... very pleased with the outcome of them. Meepillows have landed in Portsmouth uk! Am so pleased they look amazing, shame I couldn't take them to see Star Wars last night! Oh well will have to go again with my new friends x @Top Shelf Fun. Thanks look forward to the video. I Have posted a pic of them in their new sofa home and already several of my friends want to order some! Any idea when you will make them available for retail? Red and Blue showed up this morning, Green showed up this evening. Hopefully the rest will show up tomorrow. Tracking says mine is at the main sorting hub in London so will hopefully be on its way to my local depot and at my door for Christmas or just after. Can't wait to open the little box of joy and fluffy squishiness. :D Didn't receive a tracking email and assumed I'd have to wait a bit more but mine turned up today. Great job, glad I ordered. Any news on the competition and colour stats? Yay the Meepillows have arrived! I don't know what it is but they are just so huggable and adorable. Great Job Top Shelf. Just got mine this morning in the UK, they are so soft and squishy! I'm sad that we keep getting these general updates with such vague information! The comment :"Any other time of the year a few week delay would not have been an issue for most people, but this project just happened to fall into that time period that can cause the most stress. I agree however the previous post of:" Shipping Meepillow production has begun and we are going to be cutting it very close to the November delivery time frame. As you may recall I padded my times to account for a variety of possible delays, and I'm super glad I did. Everything is still looking good, but I would like to say that there is a chance deliveries could arrive in early December. It's certainly not a major delay, but I will keep you posted on all information regarding shipping since they could be gifts for your friends, spouses, and game groups. Or simply because you deserve a present for yourself (which you most certainly do)!" Enough said! Sadly, I still haven't received any shipping notification. I've been checking my inbox every time I pick up my phone....... :( Yuuuuu! Today my 3 meepillows knocked at my door. I've to admit that I was a little bit worried about not receive the parcel for Christmas, but then...here they are! Thank you again Top Shelf Fun. Great job! Well my tracking informs me that the Meepillows have reached the Royal Mail hub in London. Should not be long till they get to their new home here in Scotland now :) Getting excited for the new additions to the family. Should we all have received shipping and tracking info? Thanks in advance for your time, R Whoops. Just went through my spam and found the Green notification. NEVERMIND :) Got a shipping notification for my Red one, still looking for my green one. :) Do we get to find out who guessed right on the numbers?! Hiya, I seem to be the same as Jenn M - a tracking number that isn't recognised I got my shipping email but my tracking number isn't recognised. Here's hoping it will turn up on the system in the next day or two :D So I got an email, but when I put the tracking numbers in, nothing came up. So I'll give it a few days and hopefully it'll update. But if not, I'm just happy to know they're on the way. I also just got another shipping notice for another blue pillow. @Top Shelf Fun thank you so much!! :D looking forward to them! Based on everything you've said so far, given that I ordered 2 purple, my shipping notice should just have one line, listing purple. But my shipping notice has 5 lines: purple, green, black, purple, purple. Am I getting someone else's order? Or do they sometimes just put extra info in the shipping notice? aw, no tracking email yet... :( But thanks for the thorough explanation of what's going. I'm having the same problem, I backed for a blue and a purple, and my shipping notice only says purple. I bought the one of every color option but my tracking email only says Black meepillow. Is that normal? Yay!!!!! I got my shipping email. Alls well now just to hope they're here in time for Christmas. I hope these Meepillows are not too prolific breeders ;) I got my shipping email! :) How long until we receive our shipping emails? Or should I start worrying now? Same here. I have selected three Meepillows (1 green and 2 blue), but the mail said: "Item Description: green meeple-shaped plush pillow,blue meeple-shaped plush pillow". I wonder if they doesn't count multiples of the same color... Hi I just got my shipping email and I'm worried there might be a mistake with it. I pledged to get 5 Meepillows... 2xBlue 1xRed 1xBlack 1xGreen But the dispatch email only mentions this in the Description... "Item Description: blue meeple-shaped plush pillow,red meeple-shaped plush pillow,black meeple-shaped plush pillow,green meeple-shaped plush pillow" Is my order missing a blue meepillow? Who should I contact about this? Cheers, -Iain Update please. Hi! I just changed the delivery address for my meepillow, but I saw you already started shipping them!! Is it too late to have done this? There was still an "edit address" button under my address in my "view pledge" thingie Any news on shipping? Fab news, thanks for the quick reply, so excited! We can't wait for cuddles with our Meepillows it's so wet and rainy in the UK. Any ideas when they will be shipped? YAY! Looking forward to hugging my Meepillow on Christmas morning Everything will be sent with time to spare for Christmas though right? It takes 3-4 weeks sometimes to get to Australia. Can you please post to international backers first as it takes longer to arrive? So... do we have any results from the contest? I never heard how this was resolved... Any update on shipping? ETA at all? :) Great idea to reduce guesses by 0.9892%. Seems like a perfectly reasonable approach. Unless of course I've won with my original estimate :-) I'm curious, from an operations point of view, at what point do we write off the last 6 non-responders? So...have the 9 finished their surveys so we can get our pillows? :) @Creator Top Shelf Fun... I'm an American! A US Army veteran soldier! My heritage is Scottish, German, Welsh and Lakota Sioux. I would love to see Meepillows in the future (because I'd buy them) that embraces these themes...and more of course from other people. A plaid Meepillow for my Scottish side! A Black, Yellow and Red wavy striped one for my German heritage. A red & white striped body Meepillow with a blue head (with stars) for the All American! And a woodland camo Meepillow (That was my uniform pattern back in the day)...with other current camo choices. William...you get the idea! You're going to make a killing with themed Meepillows!! LOL Hah! I too have realized that I'd like to order more meepillows as four isn't enough! lol! I'll put the survey through, however, please add me to the list! thx:) Add me to that list as well. Now that I filled out the survey, my family decided that we need one additional meepillow. *sigh* Can I order another one? After arduous research, statistical analysis, head scratching and guessing... I have filled out the contest! LoL! Never mind. Figured it out! Silly me... I completed my survey and went to enter the contest but it didn't work. Are you able to send the link to the contest again please. Thanks! Looking forward to my pillows! When will the surveys be sent out? Yay! Congrats on doing so well! I can't wait to get my meepillows! Congrats! Will, CHEERS to you and your HOME RUN success for the MeePillows. Always stay hungry, and lookin' forward on future projects and stories of your success! I'm so excited, but not surprised, the campaign was funded! Not only is this such an amazingly awesome idea for kids, but also allows those of us who are demographically adults, but psychologically children an even better excuse to play with toys and have board game battles! The obvious sincerity in every update, the campaign notes, and emails is so refreshing and makes me even more honored to back this project, but also you! It is people like you who make this world beautifully unique and inspirational! Thank you for so freely sharing your ideas, enthusiasm and emotions via the Meepillow! I cannot wait to have them in my home soon!! Congrats....it is much deserved! Courtney Awesome Campaign! Congrats! Good luck down the stretch... Great campaign, looking forward to getting my meepillows! Loving this last big surge you're getting! Come on $60k!!! I pledged for some meepillows, can they be shipped seperate as to avoid customs. Live in Belgium. Shipping costs quite big.... like the idea of vacuum pressure in box . Can't believe I just found this. This is simply brilliant. Nicely done. (Forgive me if another has already made this...) Suggestion: Vacuum seal the pillows for shipping. You'll be able to fit 15-20 in a Large Flat Rate box. Logistical nightmare, but drops the dimensions down so incredibly low the savings just might be worth the effort. Told you so... "Ur gonna hit 40-50k" from our PM on marketing! Great job and congratulations. Ok, I wanna go for two instead of one. My daughter wanted to buy one with her own money but I guess a good man might bring a present for her. The question is: I wanna avoid customs so It would be better to split the shipment and send me 2 packages (I'll pay for any extras that brings). What is the best way to realise this? Which level and what amount to pledge? These look great, but I must admit I am a bit skeptical about two month delivery with well over 200 pillows being ordered. Just backed your wonderful meepillow project! Is there any chance this can be shipped as a gift? Belgian custom fees can be a real pain in the .... @Creator - Top Shelf Fun...I just heard a podcast with Will Faust and the SuperBoardBros...and there was mention of an "Orange" color being available in the future. How soon in the future?? Like, this week when the campaign ends??? Just wondering because it's my son's favorite color!! :) Well - I'm in for 6 - actually that's not true. There's a couple of us from my game group who are pooling our resources! Can't wait for these to arrive! Looks great. Any chance this Will be in Essen? I'm in for one but would order a few more if I could pick them up there The video totally sold it for us :) When can we pick our colors? @Creator Top Shelf Fun... Ooops! I forgot to say that the message below was for you! @ I will echo Tahsin Shamma's comment! Too many people who put up Kickstarters projects must not care about their professional image. Either don't have a video at all...or they have an extremely poor quality video! Some people have sounded so depressed or monotone...that it makes for a boring video. How can I get excited about their product if THEY're not even enthused!?! Your video on the other hand was a nice bonus all by itself. I laughed and laughed as I watched it over a few times...and then watched it again when I showed my wife and son. Your comedic approach was spot on! We are also very impressed with some of your props...like the giant Carcassonne tile (you obviously took time to make) that was to scale with the Meepillow on it. Nice touch!! The Meepillows I ordered are going to be a big hit with our kids! Guaranteed!! Thanks!! Would it be extremely cost prohibitive to offer monogramming as a stretch goal? I would totally order one for each of my kids. If I want more than six meepillows I add the cost of the additional ones plus shipping to my pledge? OH... MY... GAWD... You guys have done an outstanding job on this video. I would have donated just for the video. But, since you guys are selling awesome pillows, um, excuse me, Meepillows, I just had to have 3, one for each member of the family. Congrats on lapping you goal!!ï¿½ How confident are you in your November shipping date? I ask because this would be a perfect Christmas gift for somebody. This user's account has been deleted. If this was EU-friendly I would back it. I'm so excited that these are becoming a reality. Now there won't be any fighting at colour choice before games "no you can't be blue, I'm blue! *holds up meepillow* see! " awesomeness I think it's a little difficult to choose between some colors, can you please post a picture of the meepillows with the updated colors, before the project ends at sep13? Future discounts so that way when we get more colors it will bankrupt me slightly less to order all of the meepillows! Future discounts for backers would be fabulous - I for one don't think I can get enough of these... Made the Dice Tower News. <url>"what games use purple" question to Reddit. If you're a fan of purple and want to know, here's what people are coming up with: <url>"Man in a bear suit" delivery option? Grease optional. I don't know if anyone mentioned the idea, but if you go for more intricate designs a wood grain meeple would be fantastic. Why does it cost 15 to ship a pillow? Congratulations on hitting your funding goal The purple prototype looks more lavender than purple. Is it going to be darker than that? (the final purple swatch looks like a good color, but I can't tell if it's actually different than the prototype or just the lighting was different) @Top Shelf Fun - Welcome! I can't wait to see what you decide on! I have two ideas for KS thank yous. Both are printable items that shouldn't cost too much from a local printer, but even if they are too much for your budget, you could release them as pdfs and people could print them. 1. A booklet in the shape of a greeting card. It's a high score tracker. The front could have the color of meeple on it that a person bought and it also has the text "Keeper of High Scores" Then the inside of the greeting card has lines where people can write down the name of the game and the score they got. 2. A certificate that has a picture of the colored meeple and it says something like "Show this certificate before picking colors in a game and you get to play the color shown here." You'd probably want to fix up that text because it's not quite right. I just realised, there isn't a 'Kickstarter-Green' limited-edition meeple that is only available exclusively to backers of this campaign as a stretch-goal. A gaming related kickstarter without exclusive content for backers and stretch goals seems like it is missing something :) Are they washable? Boom! two thirds of the way there, So exciting! I am only in for 3 as its all I can afford, but if these go into full time production after the Kickstarter then I will eventually get all of them Stop posting adorable pictures of your Meepillow prototypes on your facebook page. I'm jealous and want my Meepillows NOW! Im in favor for all the other colors! I can't wait to see how this KS progresses Thanks Donny, I appreciate that. I love your eyes. So far so good, $10 isn't too bad for shipping to Oz but it is still a shame about the vacuum packing, I would have picked up a second one just watch them inflating out of the envelope. If you add a pink one later in the campaign I will pick one up, that would be another Christmas present sorted! So next KS we get orange, pink, white, sand/beige, AND Mini-meepillows, right?!?!?!?!?!? My new Meepillows will want their own smaller ones to snuggle when I am not around, Lol! And jealous pets too! Half way in a day! Any stretch goal plans? I'd love a pink meepillow! :) My wife would love for pink to follow orange. I love meeples! These are so cute! I couldn't resist! Wish I could get more, but two will have to be a good start. I do hope you'll expand to more colors later. Interestingly, the color my husband usually plays is white or natural (wood). This is due to his vision disabilities, the bright color pops off the board better. What games have purple meeples other than expansions to carcassone and 5 tribes? I plan to put my red Meepillow and yellow Meepillow in their own room for a few days, with the door closed. I anticipate an orange Meepillow will eventually come waddling out. Gotta LOVE the video!! Seeing that orange fabric on the final blue swatch picture got my hopes up, but alas no orange meepillow! :( When someone showed me this last week i was really on the fence about whether it was worth it. It was the video. I am buying one for now, but if I find my funds are higher at the end i might get two or three. After all I could use a deep sea diving buddy with blue, A friend to help me smith in the fires of mount doom in red, and a buddy to help me create my own franken monster in yellow. Have you thought about vacuum packing them?I've gotten a king size mattress delivered that was the size of a large duffle bag. Please help EU backers with tax and shipping cost! This is by far the best kickstarter video ive ever seen Yay finally im so excited!!! Sad though because I was planning on getting five pillows but the shipping kicked me right in the wallet! I know that cant be helped though. If there's ever an occasion where shipping costs could go down during this kickstarters run I will def up my pledge! Sad there isn't an orange one :( it's my favourite colour :; Can't wait to get the pillows but I think you delivery time of November is already gonna be shot by your own estimates. There is a 2 week lag on payments, so that will push until Oct 1 and then you have 2 steps at up to 6 weeks, so that is three more months and through the holidays. So I am guessing these are more for New Years! I'll take them! Good luck Will! These little dudes are so cute. I'm stoked you have purple. In for a dollar. If there were orange I'd have backed for more. Good luck! I'm so excited!! Awesome! :) Yay I got to be First Backer these are so freakin AWESOME!!!
