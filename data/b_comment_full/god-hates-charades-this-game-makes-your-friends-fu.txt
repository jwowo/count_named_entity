Hey friends we're back on Kickstarter with all new content for the game you love. God Hates Charades: WRATH is live on Kickstarter. We're still reaching for our goal and need your help getting there. Please support our dumb little game. As fans of the game you've shown us that there should be more God Hates Charades-- and now you have it! It's the best jokes we've ever written and fits in your original box. Back us now on Kickstarter! It's time to laugh until you vomit from pure pop culture induced hysteria. All the games have shipped. If you want to track your order log into your account on Backerkit ( <url>"Let's go see him together, I've got nothing better to do." - Indiana Jones --------------------------------- We'll start shipping first thing next week! The games have been inspected and delivered to our warehouse. They are being packed up and we have an estimated cost for shipping! ...Now all that's left for us to do is cope with all our brilliant ideas like offering free shipping and increasing the total number of cards in the game. While we figure out how to run a real business we want everyone here to watch this: gif that we put way down here. Chase with this gif way down here We've already shipped out 75% of the swag, only a few more orders to go! Keep an eye out for an email with your tracking codes. This is SWAG ONLY, so don't rip open the packaging expecting to salivate all over your damn game! Right now its sitting in customs... ...and they're talking forever, but we finally have an appointment to get checked out on May 26th . From there we will send it to the warehouse, they will packing it all up and ship the games out! So at the end of next week start looking for shipping notices. Questions? Praise? Hate? Just let us know in the comments! Thats 948.6 KG of game in 93 boxes sailing(not really) on the high seas! That's not the only good news we have today. Shirts have arrived which means that Swaggageddon is starting today! We'll keep you updated with more boat news as it arrives. So it's April, which is after March, when we said we get you those games... Whats the deal?? Sit yer ass down and get ready for some genuine proof of life: The games are ready! Just send me my game! Our printer has finished up the main game and they're nearly done with the expansion, we're talking this week. Shipping takes roughly 2 weeks to cross a mother fuckin' OCEAN. So you're just sitting around doing nothing?? We're ordering all the swag, shirts, buttons, sticks and all that other shit. We're going to send that stuff out separately so be on the lookout for 2 shipments(we'll send some tracking codes when it all goes down)! Got anything else for me to do while I'm just sitting here without my game? Sure follow this handy chart: - obviously - follow our new friend and super fan / Do you like Star Wars? \ - no, not really - print n play this new game we made While waiting for God Hates Charades to arrive from China, the team over here made a fun little skin on the classic Mafia/Werewolf style party games called Dinner Murder Party. You can download the game free on its site, dinnermurderparty.com . Oh, we also got our game company all set up. So welcome to the world, "God Hates Games." May we make great games for awful people forever. Cheers, For the record we think Ron Paul is bat shit. Regardless of your political leaning we are all grateful for China, right. Thanks China! Cheers, Jason &amp; Grant Shipping update time. We just read the best sentence known to man or at least to men who run a gaming company. Yep, it's time. We are now in final production mode. What's that mean to you? 30 days from now our game will be sent to our fulfilment warehouse, and then shipping begins. And as long as teddy bears don't take over the earth we'll have our crude joke filled baby to you by the end of April. We do have a couple test prints to show off. For more updates follow our blog . Until next time, Jason &amp; Grant. It's finally 2015 as Hollywood prophesied in 1985 we have Hoverboards and self lacing shoes ! But we still don't have the party game God Hates Charades. Why Marty, why? Terrible Excuse Number One Regarding Our Lack of Updates: Printing is a son' of a bitch. So as we mentioned before we had an issue with our previous printer. Mostly they kept raising their prices due to either being greedy or us being morons. We are hedging on the side of us being complete assholes. But needless to say when they came back with a quote increase of 40% we decided to pack up our assholes and go play in another sandbox. Enter our new printer. So here is the legit deal. Our new printer is cheaper which lead us to get a better quality box (thicker is always better) with a neato spot uv coating; which will look fancy as fuck, more copies of the game, and we added more content. The bad news: The game won't be in your hands in March. Terrible Excuse Number Two Regarding Our Lack of Updates: We wrote a 64 card video game expansion and added 100 new cards to the core game. So stop judging us. Terrible Excuse Number Three Regarding Our Lack of Updates: We got lost in Jabba's fat folds. The good news about this excuse is that these are coming to your door very soon. This beautiful art looks great in a frame or thrown on the floor like seen above. Either way you look like you know about art. Which makes people want to bang you. So that's it? No. Not even close. Thanks to the help of the community we updated the rules of the game and added two new variants for more strategic game play. We also moderated over 500 new cards submitted by the community and started tying our card pages to "you tube" to pull in videos of people acting. Thanks for reading. And finally because you read all the way to this point we wanted to offer a discount to share with your friends on our new pre-order site . At check out use the code, "Save A Fiver For Beer", thats $5 dollars off the game! It's been a while... We've been busy working on lots of stuff but we don't want to leave everyone hanging! What about those art prints!? Damien has been working on perfecting this masterpiece, which doubles as a Star Wars spinoff pitch we'll send to JJ Abrams in 2015. We're gonna print that using a special process called Risograph. It's like a fancy-as-fuck copy machine that has a awesome looking color palette. Cards from players like you. We've been getting a ton of submissions, thanks to everyone who helped out! We're approving, rewriting, and perfecting the cards as we speak. Keep them coming! The rules are in. It's super important for us to get the rules correct so we need everyones help to review them and make sure they're clear.
