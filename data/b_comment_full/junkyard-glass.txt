received my bowl a couple days ago very nice... looks great on the library coffee table. I got my 8" bowl yesterday. Quick question: Can I use this bowl as a fruit bowl, for bananas, oranges, apples, pears? Will the tempered glass react with the fruit? Thanks I have a feeling you mean 18" in diameter. 18' would be huge. Looks beautiful. Good luck. David.
