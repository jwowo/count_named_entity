Hi Kickstarters, We hit our 70K Stretch Goal thanks to our 2,300+ backers and have made "Bev-Rox" and "Scotch Rox" logos available! Thanks again! Enjoy. Cheers, -Zach Lengell Hi again everyone, We just shot some video of the first of our new stone saws. It's from a cell phone camera so it's quick and dirty, but it shows the saw in action. When we go into mass production, we will be cutting many Rox at one time and this type of saw provides plenty of cutting space. So far, so good! Cheers, -Zach Lengell Hi Backers! Only 9 days left! We hit a few milestones yesterday that we would like to share with all of you. 1. We reached 2000 pledges, which is incredible. Thank you to everyone who has supported our project! 2. We also received the first of our brand new stone cutting saws! - Some assembly required ;) A big thanks again to all of you backers for your support! We really appreciate it and are hard at work to bring our project to life! A side note: Unfortunately, our success has ruffled some feathers in the industry. As such, we have been getting complaints from other companies as well as slander and trolling from fake backers. It's disappointing that people can stoop this low to sabotage a new project and we apologize if you come across any of their misinformation. Rest assured, we're still on course and focused on providing all of our backers with the best product possible and the best product in the industry! Stay Classy, -Zach Lengell Stretch Goals! $70,000 - Unlock "Scotch Rox" and "Bev-Rox" labels We have had quite a few requests for both of these labels, so we're going to make them both available to you! Cheers! -Zach Lengell Dear Backers, With your incredible support we've been able to reach our goal in less than 24hrs! Because of this we can't thank you enough. We are excited about what the future holds and happy to have you along for the ride. We will keep you posted as the journey continues. Thanks again for you contributions! Cheers, -Zach Lengell
