Still waiting my order Hi guys, I got the picosteady, thanks! No instructions though. Can you please send me instructions or a link. My email is <email>. Thanks, ken- Hello David, deilvery of the product arrived today. First, thank you for the product. 2nd, after unpacking discovered the black metal frame was not wrarpped separately from the rest of the loose spare parts. This alone had loosen the powdered coated paint all around & but again a poorly powdered coat paint, it really looks ugly for $139.00. Hey guys! Just curious is there is an estimated shipping date, yet. I'm moving in a couple weeks and want to know if I need to give you a new address or if I'll get the Picosteady before the big move. Thanks!!! hey guys. Just wondering about any sort of update. thanks. i hope things with the project are going well! Sounds like the september delivery dates are already fantasy, what's the hold-up with funds? Kickstarter and Amazon takes 10=14 days to clear, so what's the problem 30 days after funding? hey guys! Whats the update about the picosteady? Anything new? will you guys make a youtube to show sample videos and how to use it? thanks. Wazzap guys! Any update? It's been 11 days! :) hope you can meet your September deadline and be the first project I backed that meets its deadline!!! :-D I commented before about making a larger one for a t3i with a battery pack or a 7d.. is that in the process? Hey, I think your product is great, but I would like to ask how is yours different from other cheaper camera stabilizers out there? <url>"It also works great with DSLR's like the Canon T2i or Nikon D5100." Does stabilizer have a universal attachment for all dslr? Looks good! Got you backed ;)
