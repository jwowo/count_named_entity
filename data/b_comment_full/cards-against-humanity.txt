Probably gonna file this under most-successful Kickstarters ever, in the long run LOL You guys are movin right along! Sold on amazon STILL!!!! And awesome on the second expansion pack...i think i just bought the last 5 on amazon that were available, if not, i will be ordering some more (christmas!!!!) anyway, let us know if/when you will be making more and if/when there will be another expansion!! A year after getting CAH and it's still one of the most frequently asked for party games I've ever seen. One girl actually burned Apples to Apples to show her love for CAH. With the expansion I've introduced something new: The winner of CAH gets to add one new black or white card to the game when they win. It's super popular, but... I'm running out of blank glossy cards. Any chance we could potentially order from you a set of blanks at some point? I don't want to keep purchasing the first expansion over and over again! So i have introduced this game to about 15 people. i have bought 2 extra copies for friends. i keep a copy in my truck just in case someone wants to play a game. i have a friend who is going to go buy it... I think you guys did an absolutely amazing job.CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!! Just got my sets in the mail! Thanks for looking into my order status! Hey Max. I brought my card set to a cottage this weekend and it was a huge hit. Thanks for all your hard work and letting me subtly admit that I pick up women at abortion clinics. Therapeutic and amusing. You can't beat that. So I haven't received any of my sets yet. I'm hoping it was delayed because of the Canada Post strike, but with every passing day I'm increasingly feeling like I threw $75 away :( Yesterday the game arrived in Austria, THX A LOT HORRIBLE PEOPLE!!! The custom cards are a different color. They seem to be brighter. I also don't care. This game rocks. Thank you so much for doing this. I got my copy yesterday and got to look at it last night. Almost lost the envelope with the custom cards. I didn't hold the custom cards up to the boxed set so I don't know if there is any difference in size or color, and I really don't care, the game is awesome. Much thanks. OH. MY. GOD. I played this for the first time yesterday and IT IS AMAZING. FUNNIEST. GAME. EVER. I gave it to my friend as a birthday gift and we played it at this tiny restaurant over dessert and we ended up playing for two hours we couldn't stop. Laughing like craaaaaaaaaazy. YOU HAVE MADE SOMETHING REALLY WONDERFUL! And now everybody wants their own including me so please do another project to make more!!!!! Fantastic job, really fantastic. You guys are legends. The corner thing happened with mine as well but it's all good. I did get the penguins though :D This game is made of awesome. My custom cards don't seem to be the same size or color as the normal cards :( My cards have arrived and my group of horrible friends played last night. It was a huge hit!! I couldn't be more pleased with the final product. Great job! Just got my copy today. I can't wait to get a group of assholes... I mean, my friends, together to play I can't wait for my cards to arrive! Got my cards yesterday. They look amazing! I will be breaking them out for their first game on Monday during my annual BBQ. Thanks again for an amazing project! Got my cards this morning...odd for media mail for it to be at my door at 9am, but who knows! Played through a bunch of it at lunch with coworkers, this is awesome :) One of the corners of my box got pretty beat up in the shipping. I know it's not your guys fault but it sucks. @David -- This project is *by far* the best updated project I have backed. These guys have made many, many updates, and made it very clear what the progress has been, for anyone that avoided living under a rock. You have to remember when backing something on kickstarter, you are *not* buying a finished product, you are backing a product so that it can be created, and thus will take a little time to ship. Man, I'm an idiot. I signed up with my throwaway email account, and didn't check it. Oh well, missed out on the custom cards. Just filled out my backer survey, at least. Don't report him to Kickstarter or PayPal. It's possible he just hasn't gotten a shipping update yet and hasn't logged in to tell us that. The previous ETA was that it could be in the states by the end of this month (I may be wrong in that memory). Wait for an update before reporting him for this. I am reporting you to Kickstarter and to PayPal. No communications and no game shipped yet. Looking forward to tons of fun with this game throughout the summer, but is there any news in ETA? ItÂ´s been a while since you guys gave us an update :) Getting VERY excited for my game! Hope all is going well with getting everything together - I'm sure you boys are all very busy! any updated ETA? Been about a month since we heard anything What's the word on shipping? It's been a while. Any updates on the printing/shipping? Think I might get my cards before PAX East? Would love to bring this to the conference... (March 11-13) So, I'm curious, are the cards going to be normal playing card size and shape like the art shows, or are they going to be lil squares like the .PDFs show. If they are going to be normal playing card size, can we get new PDF templates for making our own custom cards. You know, once you have some free time. Just wondering if the sets had been sent out yet. How can I make sure I got the survey submitted? Word got out on The Awesomer a little late and now I can't pledge :( Is there any way I can get a hold of the box set sooner rather than later? Or do I have to wait till the sets begin to get sold on the CAH website? And where is the survey you want filled out, Mr. Evil? I am waiting to get my boxed set, then throwing a party with my... evil friend group. I am going to place Cards Against Humanity INSIDE the apples to apples box, then reveal it with a swoosh. Epic can be the only result This is an amazing game. We played our first game of Cards Against Humanity last week, and it got a great response from everyone. After playing it, Apples to Apples just isn't the same. I am SOOOOO excited to get my game (and so are many of my friends)!!!! Congrats Max and Thank YOU! I included $5 extra for shipping originally, but your latest update says $5.46 including paypal fees...Do I need to make an additional payment now? congratulations, you made it! me and my friends can't wait to play. Nooo! I didn't see the $5 shipping charge and only pledged $15... Can I send you guys $5 more and get a boxed set of cards? Pretty please? is there going to be any sort of blank cards done so people can add new cards at home? Hi, is there any (however approximate) timeline for a) getting contacted regarding the 16 custom cards and b) shipping being sent out? Thanks. Seems very cool, I am glad I caught this in the remaining three hours. Cannot wait to receive my box of the game! @Max Thanks for the clarification! Can't wait to get my set. I'd posted on BoardGameGeek also to get the word out, seems to have helped :D Just out of curiosity, now that we've reached $15,000 how many cards in total do the Kickstarter backers get? Is it: 500 cards in the core set (80 Black Cards and 420 White Cards) + 40 Kickstarter exclusive cards (20 Black Cards and 20 White Cards) + 10 cards from $10,000 Challenge reached + 50 cards from $15,000 Challenge reached = 600 cards Or have I mis-interpreted the numbers? Forgot the $5 shipping. $15005. Haha Glad I could be the one to get this project to 15k. $15000! Looks like you've got 40 more cards to write! >:3 EIGHTY-FIVE DOLLARS LEFT THIS IS GONNA BE CLOSE woooo $160 in 7 hours, that should be no problem at all! weeeee're gonna make 15k! This looks like the coolest board game ever made!! If anyone else has StumbleUpon you should 'Thumbs Up' the project home so we can hit that $15,000 mark! @Joseph, Yes, it does. And since we hit $10k, it will include 10 more not available anywhere. Does the $15, printed version include the Kickstarter bonus cards? Its an adult version of Apples to Apples. Yeaaa @Hunty, Since our game is satire, I think we're safe! But thanks for the heads up. You guys might want to reconsider the "Before I Kill You, Mr. Bond" card: <url>"Apples To Apples" for the devious mind! Can't wait to share with friends! I'd like to pick up say, half a dozen copies for my store. Is this doable, and if so how should I pledge? Will you do some form of combines shipping? Thanks! @Dirk: With other projects, they create a survey after it funds and that's where you will enter your shipping info and any special instructions. Uhm, where do I enter an international shipping address? Through Amazon payments I could only add my US billing address, but no shipping address? Great game! Had you thought about translating the cards? I would buy a Spanish game... Will the instant PDF download be sent to us in an email? About how long after the pledge will it arrive? This game is going to rule so hard. We've been sharpie-ing a standard set of Apples to Apples up until now. Am I blind? Has those Add $5 to USA sections of your rewards always been there? Not trying to sound sarcastic but this is the first time I honestly noticed it. I guess I'm just use to other projects having it built in free shipping to the US. Sorry for the confusion. @Max That doesn't make sense, why is someone penalized for ordering more than one set by having a higher price? Is it possible to pledge double or triple the 15 dollar amount to receive extra copies of the game? I know a bunch of friends that would love this as a gift. Yeah I came here to post that this game described in the video is literally apples to apples. Not only does it exist in card form, it also exists in video game form. Cool project none the less. Ya'll should tweak it a bit more to appeal more to a 21+ drinking crowd. @Caleb & @Max <url>
