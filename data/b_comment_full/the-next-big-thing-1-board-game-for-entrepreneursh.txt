Your website seems to be down. Mine arrived and I played with my family this weekend. Loved it! Such a good teaching tool for kids. Thank you Jenna and Sky! Mine arrived today. I will see about playing it with a couple of my professors next week. I find it very ironic, this game, a game about new businesses, and as far as I could tell, how to make a good company, so far, is the worst project I've backed in terms of delivering on time, updates and all the stuff that keeps the hype going. Hey guys - Any word on delivery dates yet? What's the word? Everything arrive? So, it's been a month since the last post here.... what's the good word? Sad about no updates, however my teachers at business school will get just as much of a kick out of this in the fall as they would in the spring. any update on printing/shipment? its been over a month with no news. A little more guys ... so we can hit the stretch goal. Any updates. Its the last day The entire team at www.seedinvest.com is excited to support this amazing project! Met you guys at AlleyBoost Startup Expo in NYC. Happy to see you on Kickstarter. All the bestssss! Sky & Jenna, I used to love playing "Careers" as a kid. Love this idea - best of luck! Arie Didn't have a lot of money, but donated to wish you luck of a great start. Good luck!
