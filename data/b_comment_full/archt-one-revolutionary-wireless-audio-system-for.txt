An ARCHT like no other. Grab yours today! Dear Backers, The past 5 weeks have been an incredible experience. Each week we learn more about you and what you are looking for in the ARCHT One. We've sought for reviews, showcased more features like Bluetooth pairing and reached out to professional musicians for live demos. With almost one week to go, we've just crossed $200k and we're pleased to share video feature series 3 of 5. In this video, Don explains ARCHT One is compatible with your smartphones, tablets, personal computers, televisions, turntables and guitars. These devices can be connected via 4 input modes - WiFi, Bluetooth, USB and Aux. Some have asked why we have not stated stretch goals after hitting our initial target. Our team debated this extensively but decided not to launch stretch goals for 2 reasons. 1) Stretch goals would delay product delivery We want to honor our promised delivery date and ship product early next year so it arrives by January through March, depending on the tier of your rewards. Any additional changes would delay production and hence shipment. 2) ARCHT One comes with a full suite of functions In developing ARCHT One, we aspired to add a multitude of features that would make it stand apart from the competition. i) ARCHT One comes with the patented Sound Array, that provides consistent multi-directional sound dispersion in a uniquely designed audio system. ii) ARCHT One comes with a multi-speaker solution in a single unit, including a built-in subwoofer that allows listeners to place it in the corner of the room for improved bass response. iii) ARCHT One comes with auto calibration through the iOS app, that automatically tunes ARCHT One to your surroundings, ensuring you always get the best audio experience. iv) ARCHT One comes with a variety of connectivity options from high quality WiFi streaming (AirPlay and DLNA), to Bluetooth, direct USB and Aux. Anyone can connect to it. v) ARCHT One can be paired up via Bluetooth for true stereo output or can be connected to up to a total of 6 ARCHT One over AirPlay for multi-zone or surround sound functionality. All that being said, we are always looking to improve and will continue to listen to your feedback such as adding a battery pack for added portability. At the end of the campaign, we will send out surveys to gather suggestions for additional improvements or what our next product should be. Your voice is greatly appreciated. Dear Kickstarters and backers, Over Thanksgiving, we launched a series of updates to highlight the audio quality of ARCHT One through Paul Jackson's live test and a Black Friday Orbit Plus Turntable bundle. We've been asked why use guitars and turntables to do so? Does the ARCHT One only work with guitars and turntables? The quick answer is, ARCHT One works with most audio devices, from your smartphones, tablets and laptops, to your TVs, turntables and musical instruments. For the long answer, we'll have to go deeper into the topic of Music Quality. ARCHT One is built to produce the highest quality of music, the purest form of which, is live music. Paul Jackson's video therefore presented the strictest test for ARCHT One and for that matter, any other speaker worth its salt. Following which, we have high resolution sources such as Vinyl, CD and FLAC/WAV/AIFF/Apple Lossless (or Lossless files). Turntables use Vinyl, and is as close as we'll get to a music artist's live studio recording. Again a measure of how ARCHT One can reproduce music as the artist intended. For more information on high resolution audio, you can find out more from PC Mag. With increasing hard disk sizes, the music industry is slowly moving towards Lossless file formats (which are CD quality and better than MP3). Already, Forbes has covered this shift and have reviewed online Lossless streaming services, such as Tidal. With WiFi streaming capabilities of up to 24bit/192kHz, ARCHT One is as good wireless as it is wired. Regardless of whether you are streaming Lossless files through your smartphone or are using Vinyl through your turntable, ARCHT One is crafted to produce high resolution audio and deliver the best music experience possible. For those considering the step into the world of high resolution audio, do consider our Black Friday bundles, available through to 5 Dec only with free worldwide shipping! Dear Kickstarters, On this day of thanksgiving, we'd like to say a big thank you for your interest, encouragement and feedback for the ARCHT One project. We've seen a community of music lovers grow with us through the last 30 days. And as we slowly unlock the various features of ARCHT One through a series of videos, we hope to share how you can optimize your ARCHT One to give the best possible home audio experience. Feature Video 1 - Bluetooth showcases how 2 ARCHT Ones are better than 1. Feature Video 2 - High Quality Sound Reproduction showcases how ARCHT One reproduces music as it was recorded. With 15 days to go, we're happy to announce a new set of Black Friday specials that truly bring out the high quality sound reproduction of ARCHT One - by connecting music from the highest quality source. With fellow kickstarter alumni Orbit Turntables, we have created something for everyone - from the music lover, to the audiophile and budding musician. These specials are available for a limited time only and run from Thanksgiving through to 5 Dec. At ARCHT Audio, we want you to enjoy your music as it was meant to be. We hope you enjoy this amazing deal during this happy holiday season. Happy Thanksgiving! Hello Kickstarters! We're really excited to be sharing 2 videos with Paul Jackson, lead guitarist of Bloodgood, putting ARCHT One to the test. Paul grew up in a house that was constantly surrounded by music and musicians, joined his first band when he was 12 and has not looked back since. First, he tests ARCHT One for its quality of sound. Putting ARCHT One through its paces, Paul plays a wicked guitar solo and tests for balanced bass response, dynamic audio performance and realistic sound reproduction. His conclusion: ARCHT One reproduces a really true reflection of sound. Second, he tests ARCHT One in his home studio set up. Moving around ARCHT One, Paul discusses its impressive multi-directional sound (our unique sonic signature) and also concludes that it could replace his amplifiers for recording projects. The ease of set up makes ARCHT One a whole lot sweeter! Dear Kickstarters and backers, Today we embark on a series of posts that will showcase an ARCHT One feature once every few days. We're excited to share what the ARCHT One can do, starting with Bluetooth pairing since that is a question that is commonly asked! We've received feedback that the video link has been giving some issues, so we're uploading the actual video here! You'll find that set up is simple and quick and you get double the joy. So do consider getting that 2-pack today! We'd also take this opportunity to make some announcements: 1) As promised, we'll be uploading the next feature series tomorrow, with Paul Jackson, lead guitarist of Bloodgood and he'll put the ARCHT One to the test with his electric guitar. 2) ARCHT One has been featured in AZ Tech's holiday gift guide for 2014! (Scroll to the bottom) <url>’s a great experience. Check out Double Room Filling Sound in the video below! We hope you enjoy the added audio excellence of a two ARCHT system. <url>’re just over half way and have doubled our funding goal. We cannot thank you enough! Today we begin a series of updates that will highlight the various features of ARCHT One, to demonstrate all the cool gadgets stored in one awesome device. Allow me to introduce myself; I am Todd Stovall, Project Manager for Archt One project here on Kickstarter. Just a few days ago, I had an amazing opportunity to take Archt One into the studio of a guitar player (Paul Jackson of Bloodgood and other amazing projects) whose credits are impressive and varied. The idea was to hook Archt One up to his performance equipment and see what he thought. Wow! Did we get some results! In a few days, we’ll be posting the video we shot as an update on these pages of his live session with the Archt One where we see the beautiful DSP in action! The Digital Sound Processor – Or DSP as it referred to is our way of up sampling sound wave files to Archt One to maximize whatever sound source you plug into it. We have built a versatile, quality speaker to make any device you hook up to it sound better with unique, multi-directional sound that will deliver the same beautiful sound wherever you are in a room. In this case, the guitar was up running in its pure wave form uncompressed in less than 60 seconds! We think the results will speak for themselves as you watch this video; Archt One performed better than I could have imagined and we are thrilled with the result! Whether you are running at 128kb, 256kb, or Spotify’s newly minted 320kb per second, with the DSP, Archt One will up sample and give you the best sound possible. We are so thrilled to bring you this product, and with all of the comments and support – this thing really is from our hearts… We live for great sound and this has been a labor that we love that we’ll be grateful for in the days weeks, and months ahead. This is from us to you – thank-you! You are the center of what we do, and we’ll continue to communicate and bring you exciting new of our little warhead of a speaker. Keep your eyes peeled here – we’ll have that video soon, and much more! Until then, enjoy these teaser photos of the time in Paul’s studio! Sincerely, Todd and The Archt Team You asked for at least a comprehensive review, and we have one for you: Gizmag has posted this one: <url>"A 360 speaker disguised as art". So as an added bonus, we've attached some cool lifestyle pictures for your enjoyment. Check out the different places you could put the ARCHT One! Other than these press updates, our team is creating stretch goals and recording some really cool video updates to be released soon. More exciting updates to come! Dear Kickstarter and Backers, A big thank you for helping us achieve our goal and breaking through $100k. We're really excited about our first 4 days and have planned some cool updates over the course of the campaign! First up is lead guitarist of The End Game, Tyler Moore, who's plugged his electric guitar to the ARCHT One. Watch the video and see the ARCHT One replicate the sonic signature of a musical instrument, producing "Room Shredding Sound!"
