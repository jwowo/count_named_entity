Crank up the clone machine 101 'best' beers in America <url>" and you will know when your (product's) in transit because we will send you an email with the tracking #s on it." Yes that's why I posted a comment here. I am one of the earliest international backers but haven't got an email when my picobrew would be shipped out and based on the numbers, I would have been notified and received it. Ronnie, See the UPDATES (54) page...it's second from the left, above. Backer log in is necessary. Some of the international units have been sent.. (there's a map w.some of the countries)....notice the last update for more info...hope this helps A. Hi First production is all sent, when are you delivering the international backers ? Hi backers, Just want to let you all know how happy my brewing partner and I are with our Zymatic. It's worth the wait. I have been brewing since the winter of 2000/2001. We received our Zymatic in late August and have brewed 8 brews (7 recipes). We have been able to drink 5 so far after bottle conditioning, and every one tastes as good or better than what we have brewed using our traditional set up. The Just Squeezed recipe is fantastic. There's some good info on the Picobrew forum after signing in. Lots of tricks from those of us who have been picobrewing for a while. And Annie has posted good overview videos (which you don't need to sign in for). If you plan on brewing more than one 2.5 gallon recipe in a month, I recommend either buying a second brew keg (shorten the tube as instructed) or transferring cooled wort to sanitized standard fermentation vessels like a carboy, etc. Finally, if you run into any problems, just send Picobrew a support ticket (accessed through the sign in portal). Picobrew responds really really quickly his way. They have been my single best customer service experience in memory. Cheers, Mark M Dear Creator, i responded your survey (18/10) for international backers but haven't received an answer from you. i basically would like to get the REFUND at this time. I don't feel safe importing PicoBrew without all the certifications specially living in Australia. If i get something broken or faulty product on delivery it'll be hard dealing the issue from Australia. I reckon that the wisest move at this time is wait a few years until PicoBrew get all certifications and stablished in the market before I order one. It's a very hard decision to make because my wife and I were dreaming about it... We're beer lovers. Waiting for your reply, Regards Marcus Dunno if anyone else has seen this kickstarter, but the CO2 pressurized growler's look GREAT! <url>"picobrew" if they sent the info/password to you, you should find it there. You also have to sign a user agreement. Anthony, usually just enter your user name and password. Having said that, it doesn't seem to recognize either of mine, tonight. Those being 1. my email address or 2. my screen name from here. They did mention that the access is set up on shipment of your unit. Unless that has changed. How does one get there picobrew.com account? Link for the KIRO video >Start Ups <url>"Shipping Update #8: Schedule and More" there is a photo at Engadget Live Seattle event that shows a box with three tap heads. What was that box and does and is it a refrigeration device? @donevan - I'm taking a stab that I'm about 325 based on looking at the funding $ chart on kicktraq and the date I backed On that basis I'm guessing I am currently a late September / early October ship ie still 2 - 2.5 months to wait :( Sorry you have to deal with bad contractors! I'm so happy that you schooled them in how people with integrity deal with that kind of shadiness. Thank you for being awesome! How do you determine what unit number you will receive? I think I was one of the first in line for the first production run putting me in the low 100's. I haven't heard anything regarding delivery (I live in Seattle so prefer to pick up). Based on the updates, I'd expect to hear something by now. Thanks Steven - just buy the ingredients at your local hbs ? - it just won't be a kit Regarding the ingredient kits, will they be available from other suppliers or only Mountain Homebrew? Otherwise I have to go through some awkward freight forwarding services to get it into Europe. Has anyone still here received theirs yet ? Any comments on how it is going ? Any PicoBrew owners in Chicago area let me know, I'm installing mine at the home brew store I manage and would love to have other Pico owners in the area meet up for discussion and brew sessions! The store is Grow Masters in Gurnee btw and do have the best ingredient selection in Midwest. Let's have a homebrew suviche some steaks and talk PicoBrewing! I agree with Alan A brief update would be great. How many have shipped, how many people have access to the website, any new issues that change previous time estimates etc..? thanks Hi, Can we get an update on the shipping status? It's more than understandable if there are additional issues being encountered! But what is key at this point is that you routinely communicate with updates since you have primed the community for 'pending' receipt of their orders :). Letting two or more weeks pass after announcing commencement of initial shipping suggests that there is not an internally established process of external communication to the community. Is there a timeline for providing the web APIs and firmware source code per the original FAQ? Shipping status update would be great if possible..... How is production going? About time for another status update? Excited to get my PicoBrew...any update on early access to the forums and recipe crafter for those of us still awaiting delivery of our units? I want my PicoBrew! I've got a fever, and the only prescription is more automated home brew beer! Ignore the �......... Congratulations on starting up the line � Bump on my question re voltages.. Hi PicoBrew - a thought, for those of us that are 220/240v do you need to do many changes to the 110/120v unit or are all of the components dual voltage ? Thanks Hi PicoBrew Now that you've started to ship some units and solved most (hopefully!) of the problems do you have any revised shipping dates for each of the kickstarter levels ? The pre-order store says pre-orders deliver August and general availability September so I assume that would put the last kickstarter units as no later than August ? Any info. would be great thanks David ABV potential is going to be a function of batch size. You can make whatever style you want but your final volume will be limited by the fixed amount of grain you can fit in the step filter. Also, no reason why you cannot add additional malt extract or sugar adjuncts during the boil phase to increase original gravity. Hello, I thought this was mentioned at some point, but I can't remember and I haven't had luck finding it - what is the highest ABV possible with the picobrew? Will old ales or barleywines be possible? Thanks! Please don't rush these out with a bunch of bugs. Get it right and then get them to us. JMG I have been convinced from the beginning that this was a great idea and backed it because of the solid background the team brought to the table. After the backers bash it was evident this was going to happen. I have a lot of folks I have shared this with, that I can tell are doubting. I don't mind waiting for the final product cause it will be right. Thank you guys for not rushing and half stepping or compromising. would love to get the gluten free recipe. I've just stumbled across this podcast with @Picobrew - <url>"everything on track" it would be great to know how things are going ! I saw in an earlier comment that you were expecting FOT parts in early Jan - is that still on track ? Thanks David Got my kegerator for Xmas and found out on Xmas eve that I got into the graduate diploma university course in brewing I applied for :) Looking forward to experimenting in 2014 with the PicoBrew :) I didn't mean to rename your company... I meant PicoBrew. Just got my growler and tasting set in the mail. Everything arrived safe and sound. Happy Holidays to everyone at PickBrew! Chris You attach a 5G keg but it was always clear (at least to me) that it made 2.5G ? Cheers David Hello, In response to this post "Our recipe calculator accounts for grain absorption, trub and other losses to give you a specific amount of starting water to place in your keg that will ultimately yield 2.5G of finished beer" I thought the Picobrew made 5G of beer in each run? Hi PicoBrew! Thank you so much for the awesome backers bash this weekend! We had a lot of fun and it was great to talk to everyone on the team. The beer was amazing; much better than anything I've managed to brew with friends in our limited attempts so far. I'm looking forward to the arrival of the machine and can't wait to start our first brew! Thanks again! Attended the backer bash yesterday, and now I'm even more excited - I didn't think it was possible. It was great to talk to everyone there - team members especially, but also other backers. Everyone I went with agreed on a favorite - gluten free Epiphany - but our second places were as varied as the styles (personally was a big fan of the Maharaja Brown and Short & Stout). I can't wait to be making some of these amazing beers at home (and experimenting with my own)! Thanks everyone at Picobrew for the wonderful night - the tour, the talk, and of course the beer. Keep up the great work! What's the ETA on the backer "gifts"? I'm hoping to get Christmas early :) Cheers! How much information can we expect to get with regards to production status and scheduling. Will you tell us when you expect to approve FOT parts, pass MDVT etc and when you actually do. I know we are not entitled to any of that information but I'm feeling slightly burned by an Indiegogo project I backed a while ago that has slipped on its schedule. How do the water volumes work? Do you fill the keg with a specific amount of water for a specific recipe? If less water is absorbed than needed, does it just dilute the wort? Been trying to get my head around this part. Attended the first backer bash last night. It was great to meet the team behind this project. Tasted some great beers; Party Porter, Short and Stout, and D_____ Amber were my particular favorites. Jim's "PicoBrewed" pork was also fantastic! Now I really can't wait for for my Zymatic. Did the backer event happen ? Looking forward to seeing photos and video from this weekends backer event !! I can't make it there; can I delegate my backer bash invite to a friend that lives up there? Any news on the dates of the backer events? Looks like my Dec 6th and 7th opened up. What should we enter on the survey if we don't plan on making it to any of the backer events? The survey gives an error that all required fields must be populated if I don't select any of the dates. Are the dates for the backer events in the survey for sure dates? As in go ahead and buy a plane ticket? Please don't pick the 7th, that's the MLS final! Unless, of course, you're just bitter after the Timbers trounce the Sounders tomorrow. ;) What survey ? Did I miss something or did it not go to international backers ? Won't be able to make any of those dates in the survey for the bash. Bummer. A good article on picobrew and the recipes that will be coming with our units. Cant wait to start brewing with it. <url>"picobrew" community started on Google+. File under wishful thinking>> How about parties-D&P shows in NYC and Chicago/Omaha for those of us not fortunate enough to live on the Left Coast? Was perusing the Nomiku site, and that's something they mentioned. And for the internationals...go global! Congratulations on being funded! On behalf of the international backers, big thank you for arranging the shipping procedures! Wishing you guys success in reaching the next stretch goal. Is the date right on the taster set, 2014? Hoping to get a Christmas gift. Is there anyway to do more complicated mashes such as decoction or turbid? I can't imagine how that would be possible. Thanks for the update on shipping and congratulations on breaking $600k !! Thanks for the update on shipping and congratulations on breaking $600k !! I just signed up yesterday but if there is anyone else in the UK wondering about shipping, it’s not that complex to arrange, or terribly expensive: You need to find a Freight Forwarder (I’m going to use PH Logistics UK Limited, as I know through my work as an Export manager, Tel: (44) 121 764 7033), or alternatively go to someone like DHL / UPS. They will want the Tariff Code that determines the Duty and this is 8479899790 (<url>#import) and will cost you 1.7%. Unfortunately HMRC will then want 20% Tax on the cost of goods, so expect that to be around £200. Whoever you use, you want to ask for the transport to be “Ex Works” as this means they will arrange to collect from PicoBrew in Seattle and deliver to the address you specify (be sure to ask whoever arranges the transport to also include insurance unless you want to organise this yourself). The final delivery address can account for up to as much as 50% of the transport cost, so no two quotes will be the same but my expectation for door to door / Ex Works transport (including insurance) will be in the region of $200 to $300. That brings the total delivered cost of the Zymatic to around £1350 / £1,400. @Alex I'll be getting some of these instead: <url>"third" Hector's suggestion. I second Hector's suggestion. Would be a lovely though to be able to get going once we get the picobrew. Nearer shipping a website / forum to swap hints / tips / recipes etc would be great (or a dedicated area on an existing home brew forum) ? A keg and ingredients for the first recipe would be awesome for the 600k stretch goal! I know you've mentioned DMS in the FAQ, but can you clarify exactly how the wort flow functions during the "boil", and at what point that enables evaporation of volatiles? My understanding is that the wort is exposed to air while passing through the hop compartments, and the claim is that there's enough exposure there for DMS control... this is pretty much the only thing keeping me on the fence. Do you have a recipe database already built that we could see? :) Two quick questions: 1) I've heard that, for keg fermentation, a cask widge float works really nice to avoid getting a lot of trub. Would that interfere with the picrobrew during operation? Granted that using a 5g should have plenty of room to attach afterwards. 2) Would an in-line plate chiller work to cool the wort as it goes back? And we made it 500k ! Holy cow! I thought this might stall out around 450k, but it just keeps heading up, up, up. I can't wait to pop that first cold one next spring. David, or other, if one is patient...lol...Ocean freight shipping is reasonable, and I note they have a drop off in Seattle. Their site indicates country specials, now and again. regular price is $353 min. <url>"timed" in any fashion. From the webpage screenshot it looks like timing for the hops is in there but from the pictures I don't see how those compartments would be timed properly. Would that still have to be manual? I also wondered why the 5G keg seems to be a requirement? My consumption isn't high enough to justify a 5G brew so I hope we could brew smaller batches still. @Anthony Salter - Malt is part of the grain bill, and must make up 50% of the bill to be considered beer. Other grains are considered adjuncts. This is the Kickstarter that convinced me to create an account. Cheers! Wow, tough call guys... All three generous offers, a commemorative Tee would be nice, but I would have to go with the extra equipment! Thanks! Rod Foster Any of those 400k rewards would be cool, but I'll vote for the cool green oled. I should say hops + grain + malt + water = wort (+ yeast) = beer...error on my formula :-) Hey QQ: how / when / does malt play into this whole deal? I know when I've been homebrewing at Gallagher's in Edmonds, WA. the ingredients are hops + grain + malt + = wort (+ yeast) = beer. Does the machine not need malt? Or how does that work? Thanks - am SO SO excited to get my PicoBrew. 500k Stretch Goal Vote. • an extra brewing/fermenting keg lid and airlock Also please include a Keg and ingredients for first recipe for all levels of machine. Oh yeah, stretch goal complete. Seems like there is time for another one... Does it vent only from the front or is there venting out the rear as well? I was wondering about the Zymatic's long-term serviceability. How much of the device is composed of custom-made pieces vs off-the-shelf parts that I could find replacements for, should they fail? The things that come to mind as likely failure-through-use points would be the water pump(s), heating element(s), valves, any soft-sealing tracks or o-rings exposed to heat, etc. I learned about Pico Brew a few weeks ago but was on the fence about getting one. But then I was at the Great American Beer Festival this weekend as a volunteer pouring beer and who should wander by but Dr Chris White. I poured him a beer and asked him what he thought of the device. He said it looked promising from his prototype and that he had used the copy White Labs has. I asked if he thought it was worth it and he said I should consider it. So now I'm a backer looking forward to my Pico to be delivered in April. In your photos and video, the keg shown is shorter and wider than the 5G keg in the link below. Are the kegs you're showing a different capacity? I've only seen 2.5G kegs that shape. The machine is outside of my brew budget, but as a homebrewer and Arduino dabbler, I'm happy to support your project. Good luck with the manufacturing! Where do you source your 5g Cornelius kegs from? I haven't been able to find one the shape you show in the video. I've only found the ones that are taller and skinnier. Is your company thinking of producing a larger Zymatic in the future? I know that shipping cost will be calculated once they are ready to go, but do you have even a rough ballpark of what it will be? are we looking at an additional $50, $100.. or even more? Just trying to figure a ballpark of what it will cost in total for the Picobrew. It says you're going to include wireless networking with the Zymatic, but are you going to be keeping the ethernet port as well? What else will I need to finish my beer with the machine and the add ons? What is a good container to ferment the brew and what else might be needed to have an End to end process working? Thanks! I'm excited to be in the second production group with some friends! We had a couple of questions (at least for now :)): - What kind of anti-foam and foam collapser does it come with? - Is there a way to get additional keg lids so we can ferment multiple batches at a time? Thanks!! You guys might be interested in this other Kickstarter going on: <url>#2 in this weeks top new crowdfunding projects list: <url>"favorites". I have been begging for a Zymatic test unit for months....so now I get my chance. The guys have been kind enough to us (as a vendor) to keep us supplied in some sample brews and each one is better than the last. I _love_ this. I've been dreaming about making my own delicious beer for years, and now I can, amazing! This is probably the coolest thing I've ever seen. I have a friend who brews and has quite an extensive series on Youtube that I enjoy watching. Still, I've been intimidated to venture into it. Until this! I have a quick question about the backing levels. Does the Zymatic kit levels come with any of the other backer levels (i.e. growler, shirts, glasses)? It would be cool to rep the new system we'll be making our friends before we get it. If not, maybe consider it as a stretch goal? Great Seattle Times article on PicoBrew: <url>
