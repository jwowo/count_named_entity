today is another anniversary of having this blanket. It reminds me of what a fraud you are and may misfortune follows you and your family wherever you go. This is such a fun blanket! Unlike any other blanket I've seen. A few years later people are still commenting on it when they visit my home! So happy I got one ^_^ Apparently you can ask for a refund; not that I am advocating it but I understand why one would be frustrated. Looks like a bait and switch... We got a situation on hand: The product I paid for isn't the product advertised. Something must went wrong along the line during the production process. What was it and why we were not notified? The communications has been few and far between and I am quite upset Bianca. Please address some of our concerns here. Got the blanket. Nice, although not quite as crisp as I thought it would be. The only complaint I have is that its not bigger. I see now that there were dimensions posted (that I didn't pay attention to) so no fault of the creator but in Canada, when we think of blanket, we figure it will at least cover a single sized mattress or bed. still it is warm and cozy. I had to post again; after taking a nap with it I absolutely love it. Yes, it's different, but it's still unique and beautiful. And after fluffing it up the little peaks stand up better now, after it properly desmushed from its shipping box. Thank you!! ❤️ I'm in the USA and I just got my Bloom. It's very soft and well constructed, but admittedly quite different than the prototypes. It's still very nice, just very different; a softer, snugglier, slightly depressed second cousin. For those that want to achieve the crisp origami peaks of the prototype, consider adding a back layer and some light stuffing inside, tacked down at the corners of the peaks. Admittedly, I wish we had been updated on the design change, and I hope her website posts the more accurate product, instead of the concept prototype. I'm more forgiving of it's altered appearance because it's still unique, and very cuddly, but I'm still considering if I should add a bit of stuffing to bring out it's architectural shapes... Out of custom (allegedly) In custom now... Not Russia; its Germany. Fyi, I think the item is coming from Russia and unfortunately it will sit in custom for quite some time before it will get here to the U.S. based on my experience. Anyone think the Creator will ever comment about the design change? Probably not... I wouldn't. Thoughts? I too have not received my bloom blanket, nor any tracking info. But that sounds like the case for most US backers. The bloom website is also saying that blankets will be shipping in Feb 2015, so maybe there was a backlog or something wrong in the manufacturing side. Just got this in the mail. Although it doesn't *look* exactly like in the video with the peaks being erect and all that... the moment I snuggled underneath it, I was almost immediately warmed and I loathed to get out from under it (mind you I am in Chicagoland and it is getting towards freezing temps as i am writing this). This really traps heat well which makes it well worth it for me. I am tempted to bring this to the office to snuggle under whilst working, b/c it is that cold in the office. No blanket yet. I was supposed to get it in Oct. They got my hopes up when they said that they were at Amazon in Atlanta. I live in Atlanta. I have asked a couple of times about it, but have received no reply. It is like no one is there. I received tracking information (US backer here) but package still in Germany even though it was processed in 12/27... combination of DHL and USPS service may be the reason why. Anyone else in the US still not get their blanket yet? I like my bloom blanket big time. it is definitely a unique piece in my living room. Every guest at my new years party commented on it. it is definitely a mystery object. Not everyone likes it, some people don't get it, but many others were very intrigued. A friend commented it's a Bat-Blanket. It's pretty cool, great conversation starter :-) The quality of the material and the build quality is very high. I have backed other project on KS and this one is sure a success. I agree the piece might look not as perky. I found to enjoy more the back of blanket, where it shows the structure. Go Bloom. mine looks deflated as well...at first I thought it was because of the packaging...also I notice, the size is small, can't cross check with the specs size because it's not states in the pledge options. The material however it is soft & warm. Anyone else from Canada whose blanket is stuck at customs? It first showed up at customs on the 21st. Hoping it's mostly to do with the holidays. @Robyn You may want to use a separate link because it shows other pictures too that you may not want to. Thanks for sharing the blanket pictures and wow definitely different. The squares are so much bigger and I see what everyone means by the flat appearance as oppose to the 3-d effect from the video. I wouldn't call this bait and switch just yet because I want to see it in person but I see what everyone is talking about. As for the refund, sure I suppose we can request for it but I think as a backer the creator owe us that much to explain the change in appearance. We shared the vision of the creator and was impressed with what we thought was the end product only to end up with something that was different. Just want to know why... Photo 1: <url>"formed" (less floppy) 3D shapes/triangles. Seeing this now in person, it looks like it was probably a trade-off to go with using the nicest softest wool vs. trying to preserve the full 3D effect by stuffing it or using a significantly stiffer fabric. It is still visually interesting on either side, and is certainly not flat by any means ... just a lot more soft melting version of what the pictures show. Give it a good shake and it helps bring out the peaks/texture. In the end I think the lesson here is to make sure to lead people to the right expectations (Note ...If anyone is really unhappy, see Bianca's website on returns.) For me, I'm keeping and enjoying this. I'll be interested to see what my wife, who does not have the KS campaign expectations but does appreciate sewing and quilting design and expertise, thinks about it when she gets it for Christmas ! Again thanks Bianca for seeing your project through and keeping us nice and warm this winter ! @Robin may I ask you how the quality and how does it feel besides the look? Can you possibly post a picture? So, I got mine. As I thought, it doesn't look like the one in the video. My friend called it "deflated." So what's the deal? Why is this? Did I miss an update? Anyone know? US October backer. I just got my tracking number from amazon. I'll get my blanket on Monday! Great news, January backer here in US and just got my tracking! Mine arrives tomorrow. I'm an Oct backer (US). Just got an email from "OAK FORM" saying they are shipping it now via US postal service: "Shipped via USPS (estimated delivery date: 12/20/2014 PST)" I was in the October delivery batch. Looking forward to it ... just in time ! Any USA backers get theirs? If so are you the first batch backers or second batch? I got my blanket today in Canada and it looks good! It even managed to slip through customs with no additional charges. For the curious it was shipped from Germany via DHL then handed off to Canada Post. Must wonder if the @creator will address some of the design changes in the near future... @HC i believe you are correct. If compare the main website to the pre-production design the seams are on the other side and it does appear more plush. I think the techtron thing is also smaller I'm going to guess its the seams, the blanket bianca has the seams are inside, and in the production model, they're on the outside...plus, her blanket looks plush, and the ones i'm seeing from users on instagram are...deflated. @Daniel - Post a picture? Is it the size of the tetrahedrons? Hi, I just receive my blanket today. I'm very disappointed because it don't looks like the same as you show in your video. I don't like it at all. Hi Bianca. I am an October backer living in the NYC area and have not received the 1 blanket I backed. Any idea where mine is??? Follow up to my comments 7 days ago. From a customer's/backer's point-of-view everything seems to have suddenly leapt forward. I got a DHL shipment tracking number two days ago and I've been continuously watching the package creep across Europe since then. It looks like it will beat the very first delivery date I was given 'way back in March. I'm not sure if I can accept it early - my personal logistics aren't set up for this! :) I'm sure Bianca is really looking forward to a satisfying Christmas holiday break. It's been an incredible achievement to get this whole operation up and running in such a short time, and I have nothing but admiration for someone who has the initiative, self-discipline and motivation to tackle this. Well done and congratulations, Bianca. Now let's hope for some cold weather to make the blanket really appropriate and relevant. Reference the chart from the latest update: Oct. batch for US order arrived for Distribution on Dec. 4 meanwhile the second batch which is the January order is schedule to arrive on Dec. 12. If it take 5-7 business days for delivery US orders for both batches should be arriving before Xmas. Sorry for double posting the same question but I wasn't able edit the last post, meant to say What is the estimate that New Yorkers will receive there blankets. Hi Bianca, just wondering what is the estimate on when will New Yorkers' l receive their blanket. Hi Bianca, any estimate to when we can truly receive blankets in Europe? Will it be until Christmas? I dont care about delays, but I would like to know true possible delivery date. Hi Bianca, I placed my order on the original kickstarter and got an est delivery date for October. Should I have gotten my blanket by now? Really looking forward to it! Hi Bianca, I placed my order on March 6 and got an est delivery date for October so I'm assuming I was part of the first 400 but haven't received mine as of yet. Should I have? Hi Bianca, is the October badge of blankies to the US still stuck in customs? Eitherway, still stoked about your project. Can't wait to hold it my hands. Hello from Brooklyn, Jan �� Got the email about my blanket being prepared to ship! excited! Anyone from the January group got theirs yet? @Form Devices, @Alexander Thanks for the prompt responses - much appreciated. Yes, it is my first Kickstarter project. I've bought from others after they were funded but this is my first start-up. I can't recall the different categories of pledges and where I fitted in, but it doesn't really matter as I can't check or change that now anyway. I guess the over-riding message is don't look for time-critical items in Kickstarter! This was purchased (Doh! See, there I go again. Inappropriate language like 'purchased'. Will I never learn?) as a birthday gift for someone. But I warned them back in March that it could well be late. I think they were more amazed that I'd remembered their birthday that far in advance, and intrigued by what could possibly take 9-10 months to get delivered, than to worry about minor issues like getting the date exactly right. I hope I didn't come over as annoyed or angry in my original post (he quickly apologised, having re-read it). I guess both parties in a new form of transaction need to learn their way around the system, especially if one of them's an old greybeard (and that's clearly not Bianca.) If it's all down to waiting then I'm happy to wait. I just didn't know what to expect. Thanks again. @Ken Muir It depends on which reward you pledged for. There were 400 blankets that were to be delivered in October and the balance in January. I wasn't on board early enough to get the October spots. Not sure what category you pledged. If she is saying that they will be here before Christmas for all backers that would actually be early for those of us who were not in the initial 400. I have backed many projects this year. I don't think I have ever seen one early yet. Hi Ken, It seems like this is the first Kickstarter project you backed. It's not exactly like ordering things from a store. You are backing independent creators, who in many cases are doing this for the first time. There are almost always shipping delays, and Bianca is actually one of the most on-time projects I've seen! Also, the blankets are great, you'll love it when you receive yours. I'm really puzzled by the sequence of Updates regarding progress on this project. I genuinely thought I was one of the original backers. My payment was taken on March 30th 2014 and when I log in here it shows a green "You're a backer" label. The original delivery date seemed to be estimated as Jan 2015. Subsequent updates included statement like "That will mean that I will have to travel a bit more, but it will be worth the effort to get 400 of my backers their blankets before the end of October." (posted in July), "Every single Kickstarter backer will receive his or her blanket before Christmas!" (posted late September) and "The first batch of bloom blankets is finally finished and on its way to my American and European distribution centers!" (posted early November) Today (3rd December) I've just received notification that Bianca is "getting ready to send out 'rewards' " for backing the project. And it turns out the 'reward' is a blanket. Nope. Sorry. The blanket is not a reward. It is what I ordered. And as Bianca's only 'getting ready' (i.e. not actually doing it yet) the expected delivery is now back to Jan 2015 again. So what should I expect? Am I a backer? Was I ever a backer? Do I get a blanket *before* Christmas? Or do I get it in Jan 2015? Did anyone get blankets as far back as October? Is the first batch finally finished? What are the blankets doing in a distribution centre for a month? I can't believe that there are shipping or export problems within the EU (mine is an EU shipping address). Oh, so many questions ... It's DECEMBER woohoo!!! You seem to be less than 1 month behind schedule, which I would call ahead of schedule for any Kickstarter project. Any idea if the January 2015 orders will be delivered in January or slightly sooner or later? By now you must have a pretty good idea when they will ship. My deadline was February (a gamble I know). C'mon custom it's getting chilly here!! Lol Got mine today too! Going to let my wife open it though! :) I received my blanket today, it's perfect and so soft thank you :) Any new updates? thank you for the update, shipping stuff can already be a real pain even when you only send out one thing, and you have to send out about 800 parcels all over the world and still try to keep up with community support you did an amazing job so far and I hope you can get it all done in time before xmas and then have some nice holidays :) Does the same go for backers in the USA? Hello Bianca, hope you are ok, could you please give us an update? rabe Will we get tracking numbers or should we just expect them to show up soon? Hello Bianca, I hope you are fine :) Were you able to sort out the issues that caused the shipping delays? rabe Hello I ordered a blanket with a delivery date of January. We are moving and plan to be in our new home by then. Who should I provide my new address to so when the blanket gets ready to ship, it ships to our new address? Jennifer Schneider thanks for the fast reply and all the effort you put into this project :) Do you have some info about the October shipments? It's getting cold here^^ Two more months!@!@ lol this is the best blanket ever! can't even imagine it during a winter .. but I bet it's a dream... : ) you are teasing us on instagram, can't wait to read the update :) Tony, do you know if that's when the survey for addresses etc will go out? Thank you! Things have been insane in my world and I want sure when. I'm also overly eager! Thanks for the update! :-) Jennifer, the first batch is scheduled to be delivered in October I'm a backer from early on but I never received a survey asking for an address our information. I was supposed to get the blanket a while ago in the first batch. I'm not sure what to do. Can you advise? Thanks! So excited! I can't wait! Can northern climates (ie Canada) get them sooner to keep us from our earlier winters, please? How're things coming along? Please add my name to the list of backers on the Bloom Blanket website.

I'm SO happy for you, please add me to your list of super proud backers ^_^ Well done Bianca ! :) Please add me to your list of backers. What a wonderful use of mathematics, design and whimsy. You are a great artist Blanca! This is so beautiful, I would love to be able to back you with more. Best of luck x Yes please add me to ye backers list! And I didn't see where to select a color, are we being contacted about it later? Please add me to the bloom backers page. Fantastic blending of art and science and creative inspiration. XxX H I can't wait to receive this beautiful piece of functional art! great that your funding is successful, I'm looking forward to receive my bloom blanket Curious about the shipping. Why is shipping to USA included, but not outside USA when production is in Spain. I'm in Canada. Surely shipping to Canada is not $19 USD more than shipping to Canada? Is the blanket going to be a one shot production run or will you be making them periodically? Peter Richard - Already asked that directly and was answered yes, she will send blankets to European backers directly from Spain. The blanket looks wonderful. I'd love to be named as a backer. This looks like a great project. Will you be posting from Barcelona to the European backers? Looks like a wonderful blanket! Can't wait to receive mine and start cuddling =P. By the way, are you thinking of going commercial with this sort of product? Or is this just a fun project? Either way I'd love to be named as a backer and can't wait for my bloom! It's a lovely design and I think it's wonderful that you were able to mix math and art to create it. I'm looking forward to receiving mine :) May we get a picture of the full blanket just to get an idea of the full size. Happy to be a backer on this wonderful project :) Love this idea. How beautiful! Thank you for executing this project. Proud to be a backer - please add my name :) Beautiful idea <3 Soon, there will be no places for backers:-) once [last week] there was a time before this blanket was famous. but now, thanks to Kickstarter & Bianca Cheng Costanzo, the world is warmer.. more beautiful too.. Congrats on the funding! Best wishes with bloom blanket! My wife can't wait to receive hers! Hi Bianca, this is truly an amazing creation. I'm glad you pursued your passion! Excited to get this blanket. Please add my name as a backer. Congratulations!! Congratulations! Please add my name to the website list as a backer too! Wow, this just exploded! :) So glad to have found this before the KS email went out. Please do add my name to the site - very proud to be supporting this! Hope the many extra pledges won't delay production! ;) Congratulations on your successful funding! Please add my name too! Congratulations for getting featured in "Projects We Love" !!!!! I feel pretty awesome for being one of the first to sign up for a Bloom! Keep up the awesome work, Bianca. well, this blanket project just got spotlighted... wonder where it's going to go now.. somewhere over the moon probably... coolest blanket ever.. blessings Woooo! Congratulations on reaching your goal! upping my pledge to $22 pushed it to the goal. Dismissed as coincidence! Hello, I would also like my name added to list of backers on the bloom website! Cheers! Cool idea !! This is a fantastic and innovative design !! I think you can add my name to the list of backers on bloom's website!! It’s my honor !! This is absolutely beautiful! Is the material stiff, or soft? Can you snuggle up in it without the material being uncomfortable? Also, if this is made in Spain, why is there only free shipping within the US? How about some love for fellow Europeans? ;) Great work - excited to see this! extraordinarily beautiful brilliant practical innovative amazing idea, coolest blanket ever.. wow. This is such an amazing idea! I'm happy to help support you in your dream! I love you miss Bianca! :)
