Hi! We just wanted to share a short video Sundance put together featuring us speaking about the filmmaking process that went into Welcome to Leith . <url>"Leith’s recent stranger than fiction history speaks to American ideals of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness – most provocatively, on both sides of the conflict. The town’s relative desolation and Midwestern setting paradoxically suggests both a sense of inconsequence and import – while Cobb’s plan may have only had an impact on a small number of people, it might have been the testing ground for expansion to other small towns and beyond." As well, Tribeca Film chose the project as their fundraising pick last week: "While it would be an easy story to sensationalize, Nichols and Walker capture both sides of the Leith conflict with objectivity and respect." Finally - Chris and I will be on HuffPost Live at 2pm ET today! We'll be joined by Leith Mayor Ryan Schock calling in, and white separatist Craig Cobb via Skype. You can check that out here: <url>"Welcome to Leith": <url>"vitally important" by Christopher Stipp of Slash Film, who went on to write "the pitch/trailer does not mess around, does not speak in platitudes, but lets the content of what will be examined speak for itself. It’s wonderfully presented, really well shot, and could not be more deserving of a couple minutes of your time," while Mary Noble of Politix describes the trailer as "haunting." The catch is that the filmmakers behind WELCOME TO LEITH need some money to get their film off the ground. I recently donated______ and I encourage you to do what you can to help. They are using a website called Kickstarter to raise $60,000 by July 2nd. Every little bit counts, so please take a look at their campaign and consider donating: <url>’s a great way to be involved in documenting an important story. Thanks for taking the time to read this and let me know if you have any questions. Your Friend, _____________ Hey Welcome to Leith team, Just a couple of quick updates: Michael did a Reddit AMA today - if you'd like to see some of his answers to making-of-the-documentary questions, you may do so here .

Take a listen to his nervous voice over at Prairie Public Radio if you dare! Thanks again for all your support. Mike and Chris We can't thank everyone enough for contributing to our campaign and helping us spread it around. You're helping us tell a story that we feel will resonate for many, many years.
