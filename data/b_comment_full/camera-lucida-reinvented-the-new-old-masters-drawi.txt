Hello Everyone! I just launched my new Kickstarter, and I want to make sure all my awesome backers don't miss out on the EARLYBIRD pricing that will only be available for one day! So please come watch my fun new video and find out more about the Animation Dome! <url>—very sorry for the clutter. Thank You So Much! Les Hey Everyone! Apart from a few backers who have still not filled out the survey or gotten back to me with questions about their address, we have now shipped all the rewards!!!! I know some of you have already received your reward. Please watch the instructional videos to help you get started. Here is the video for the LUCID-Art, the old Photo Projector (which was nor part of this project), and the drawing board: <url>—thank you so much for taking that ride with us and being so patient with us as all this came together. For any of you wanting to give these rewards out as Christmas gifts, all the domestic and many of the international rewards will be delivered in time for Christmas. If any of you wanted to order another camera lucida as a gift or for yourself, I will be leaving the Kickstarter prices up a little longer to give all my great backers one last chance before the prices will have to go up. You can place these orders here: <url>“Get It By Christmas” shipping option during checkout, you can still give these out as gifts. Please let me know if you have any questions. And here are a few behind-the-scenes pictures from the project. Thank you so much!!! Les Hey Everyone! Wow! Thank you so much! As the campaign came to a close on Saturday, our 357th backer slid in about a minute before the the campaign ended to finish off a great campaign and now comes all the work. FUNDS. The first step is to collect all the funds. Most of your cards were successful charged on Saturday, but last I checked about 9 backers still need to correct some information with their cards. If you are one of those backers, Kickstarter will be in contact via email to get that straightened out. Kickstarter gives us a week to collect all the funds and after that we will be on to production! SURVEY. Soon (probably next week) I will send out a survey where you fill-in your shipping details and other information. This is how I know where to ship your reward—so please be sure to fill it out as soon as you get it. Then if you move or need to change the shipping address, you can log-in to Kickstarter and update the address any time before we ship. PER-ORDER. If you want to add another reward to your order. Or maybe tell a friend where they can get one too. You can go to our pre-order page here: <url>—the video list off a whole bunch of other benefits: <url>—we just passed $43k—thank you all so much for your support and your help spreading the word! This is all happening because of you! There is a lot of creative possibility with my LUCID-Art and LUCY camera lucidas, and the video below shows two more examples: drawing from an iPad and using the ProjectorARM as a stand for the camera lucida app. Please watch... Here are the maximum enlargements with tablets: With the LUCID-Art- Enlarge to about 18.25 x 14 inches with a iPad or standard tablet Enlarge to about 14 x 7.58 inches with a iPad Mini or mini tablet With the LUCY- Enlarge to about 14 x 10.75 inches with a iPad or standard tablet Enlarge to about 11.75 x 6.36 inches with a iPad Mini or mini tablet Here is the link to buy the iPhone camera lucida app: <url>“Artist Eye” on Play Store. If you have a choose between the two app—go with the Camera Lucida app on iPhone. Please continue to share!

Shoot me a message if you have any questions, or if you want me to confirm the total you should pledge for your add-ons. 2. Project Image The project image is the image that is at the start of the video and what is listed on Kickstarter when people are looking through projects (as pictured below). I am a very visual person, so I think this image is very important. I want this image to tell the project's story. I was never really happy with the project image I started with, and about a week ago or so I changed it. So I just wanted to get feedback from all my awesome backers and see what you all think about the change. I changed the wording a bit too. So if you have feedback, please comment below. 3. Cool way to take pictures with your phone There are a lot of cool projects on Kickstarter, and the GripSnap stuck out to me for two reasons. One is how simple and effective the device is—just a great way to be in your own pictures. And second, I was thinking this would be a great way to take some awesome pictures on your phone, so you can draw those pictures with your camera lucida and ProjectorARM! Took a look and consider becoming a backer like I did: Thank you all so much! Les Hey Everyone! Thank you so much for backing this project—and welcome to all the new backers since the last update! First off, I wanted to share a link to my GoodDay interview over the weekend: Second, I wanted to give you some progress updates on the ProjectorARM. I now have the first article of the custom arm from our manufacture: Like I mentioned in the production plan, while the camera lucidas themselves are manufactured in the USA, the arm for the ProjectorARM is pieced together from existing components from overseas. The flexible arm is a rubber coated 10mm gooseneck that is about 2 feet long. The clip comes from a cell phone holder, so it is made to grip any android or iPhone. It had a nice embedded rubber pads on the inside of the grip to protect your phone: The clamp is a solid aluminum C-clamp that comes from an iPad holders, so it is very strong and will give the ProjectorARM a firm anchor. The top, bottom and back of the clamp's month are covered with silicone pads to protect your table: Now the ProjectorARM manufacture is ready and waiting to take our order as soon as the project funds, and we see how many we are going to need to order. The other half of the ProjectorARM are the lenses, and I will update you on them a little later on. That is it for now! Thank You! Les Hey Everyone! Looking back and watching this video, I was probably a little too excited yesterday, but I had a couple ideas I had to try. This is not the way these devices are meant to be used—just a bit of fun tinkering in the garage... <url>—just delete the extras. Links: Camera Lucidas: Current Kickstarter Project FUNDING NOW!

I know we would do it, but I didn't think it would be this fast—WOW Thank You So Much! This means that this project is going to happen! The ProjectorARM will be created and many more of my camera lucidas will be built! The Project will continue to run until September 6th, so please keep telling your friends, and we will see how many more want to join in on this adventure. As of right now we are 132% funded with 33 days left, so I'm starting to think about stretch goals, but those would still be a little ways off. Ideas are welcome, but my main focus right now is running a good campaign and delivering some awesome rewards! Thank you so much!!! Les Hey Everyone, Day two and first update! We just hit and passed the 10k mark, and we are well on our way to reaching our goal very soon. And then I got this message from Kickstarter: Please help spread the word about this project...Tweet, post on facebook and blogs, tell your dog... The link to share the project: <url>
