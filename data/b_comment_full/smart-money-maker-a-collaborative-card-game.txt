I got my smart money maker in Australia. Haven't played it yet but am hoping to get a game in tomorrow at work. Congratulations again on successfully funding this kickstarter Laurence! I got my Smart Money Maker! Great to hear! I'm looking forward :D. How's everything going? I'm just curious what stage we are at? Congratulations! This is really great. So excited to see this funded and be part of another great project. My decks will be gifts for a couple of families with the oldest kids just entering preteens. The parents appreciate my finding things that combine fun and learning and are new and different so their kids can introduce their friends to cool things. This should fit the bill nicely. :D Congrats @alchemistmatter! Congratulations! It's awesome to see that it got funded. I'm looking forward to playing it :). Congratulations Laurence! After our recent discussion I am excited to be the person to help you reach that $3000 goal! Looking forward to playing this next year.

Where are you shipping from - Milan or the US?
