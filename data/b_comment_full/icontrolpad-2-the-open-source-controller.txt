Hello Backers, My apologies for the lack of an update in April. I just heard from Craig last week, he is sending me iControlPad 1 units that are left over from his shop. I can send these out to backers who pledged for an ICP1 &amp; ICP2 Unit, these folks will have priority on them. For whatever is left, for anyone who will take an ICP1 as a substitute for the ICP2 reward, we can do that too. I'm not sure how many are coming, nor am I sure when they will arrive. If there are any units left that nobody here wants, they will be sold via Ithic's webshop and proceeds go towards refunds here. Below is a breakdown on where the funds went. Kickstarter Deposit: $188190 November 2012 $7500 to MJW Designs $35000 to ICP Ltd. $62500 to OpenPandora GmbH for BoM $15000 to ICP2/Craig December 2012 $7500 to MJW Designs $19925 Roving Networks BT Chips $14000 Ithic Account Shipping US/Canada Orders $2500 Consultation Mark Linkhorst March 2013 $14000 to ICP Ltd. for development case/out of shipping funds (UK/EU/World) to be reimbursed on presales of extra ICP2 units produced in order. Since June 2012 $5200 Administrative Ithic Remaining funds have been used for tax liabilities for 2012/2013, accountant fees, shipping supplies, shipping equipment, wire transfer/bank fees, and other expenses. Refund Information: <email> For the email address above, please contact it only if you desire a refund, and get us an update on your mailing address or PayPal email address in which we can refund you. If you have already requested a refund via the email address above, there is no need to make another request. Just mentioning this again for anyone who missed the March 2014 Update. Beyond funds coming in from ICP1 units possibly or reduced refunds desired monetarily there is no word on parts that have been sold, as soon as we have more information from what was sold or can be sold, we'll start the refund process once that money is back on the account. Please bare with us during this process. Your patience and understanding is appreciated. Just a quick update to say the first batch of PCBs were unfortunately wrong with the LEDs not correctly placed on the board. Since this was ~$10k of parts we're hoping the factory will be fixing this on the house. Will update further when we know more. These things happen and it's why were being ultra cautious as we move (slowly) forward. It could easily have been all 3500 PCBs if we had rushed the production. The first batch of the first run of 1250 iCP2 boards have finally arrived, and these will be extensively tested while we wait for the redesigned Keymats to arrive. The keymats had to be redesigned for the LEDs, this has lead to some unforeseen issues. Firstly the old keymat, very similar to the Pandora keymat, was quoted at around 33-40c each, however the new keymat, which has to use a different material designed for backlighting has been quoted at $3(!) each in Europe, so we have since got some quotes from China. Unfortunately they repeated the fact that backlighting material is much more expensive and combined with the silkscreen which is compex the best quote we have is around $2 per keymat. Oh dear. I shall try to throw some of my own money in to cover this. While those are being made there is a final firmware issue with the nubs to solve, I hope to have an update on that asap, if it works out it will be solved at the same time the keymats arrive along with the first batch of cases and holders. Finally, as some of you know from PMs I, Michael and Jacquelyn all have full time jobs away from this project, none of us expected it to take this long, but that's just the way it is. We will finish it up and get there eventually. The ridiculous abusive emails from a very small number of people have continued and it really does just drain your energy for a project which started as being a really enjoyable challenge. I wanted to try to write something here which tries to put things in to perspective, the fact that this is just a BT controller and not a life changing event, but I don't think it will work. For those of you who have been really cool and sent supportive emails, thank you, we will get there and deliver a solid, quality product, along with an interesting (for some) video about the whole process. I'd hoped to have a photo of lots of the PCBs, but wanted to get this update out today, so there might be a follow up photo after the weekend. Thanks, Craig The situation is still the same I'm afraid, the LEDs have not arrived yet and we're chasing up what is going on there to try to find out if we can maybe get half of them to at least produce some units quickly. Until they arrive nothing can be done as they are required for the PCB production, which is required for the case production. We're essentially stuck in development hell. Believe me we wish we didn't go near those LEDs, especially after we said we knew the dangers of advance goals. This is all on video. It does not make for happy watching, I'm pretty depressed about it all, especially after the iCP1 went so smoothly. I hope the next update can be more positive. Thank you for your patience. -Craig Several people asking for an update, so here is where we are at this very moment: The ~12000 LEDs have still not arrived. Until these arrive nothing exciting is going to happen in terms of showing off the final PCBs. I know this is frustrating, but these LEDs have a longer and longer lead time due to the demand for them. We were quoted max 12 weeks when we ordered them, if they meet that they will arrive soon. Usually parts arrive much sooner but it seems in this case the shortage is real. We didn't know about this until we went to order them unfortunately. Previously thousands were shown as available. After several people suggested we buy them on alibaba I showed this to Michael and he said you can't just buy these LEDs there, they are not the same. Michael has almost finished the firmware and it will be posted to a GIT when done. He understandably does not want to post it until he is happy with it. We hope it can use at least a modified version of the layout which was voted for (there are some issues with the winning one which we will go in to when the firmware is posted). The firmware has extensive extra support meeting new standards for phones, especially for Android, and it should work with various USB stick sized PCs (a growing area). I would also like to confirm here that Mark (Link), the chap running the USA side of this, is entirely reliable and I've known him a long time, the person posting comments to suggest otherwise is mistaken. Mark is taking this seriously, he has kept me in the loop with all the KS financial activities from day one and it's all in order. The person who is making alternative allegations may have ulterior motives. Also, please, if you have any questions email us, we answer! Thanks, Craig Quick update, nothing particularly exciting to report, PCBs still in general production, quite slow due to a world wide shortage of... yes.... RGB LEDs. These seem to suddenly be used in everything and it has not only caused a shortage but pushed up the price in smaller numbers. Quotes of over $1 EACH are not uncommon. Seeing as we need a minimum of 5 per PCB that isn't great, but we managed to source them for about 0.44c each, this adds a lot more cost to each iCP than we anticipated, but it's done. Hoping for some photos of thousands of PCBs soon. I'm also looking forward to generally documenting everything in detail, this will happen as soon as we're shipping. I also want to detail the future possible uses for the iCP2 tech at that point, which some of you may find interesting. Thanks, Craig Here is the first populated PCB :) The little wires are for debug and will be gone in the consumer version. Hello everyone, Just to keep you all up to date, the final (FINAL!) PCB designs were submitted to Global components and things are now rolling along nicely. They include numerous updates and tweaks over the last version. When will we have the final product? This keeps on being asked but it's difficult to answer with accuracy, now, 99% of you are wonderful and patient and understand we're trying to deliver the best product we can, rather than rush a product with faults. But it's difficult to give a date because if we miss it some people get upset - we get upset too! We want this delivered yesterday as much as you do. No doubt *something* will cause a delay or need to be revised before we ship every order, it always does, this is the nature of unique, programmable products like this. This is Kickstarter. But the important thing to know is we are working to deliver everything we promised and a little more. So please, don't send Debs agressive emails, she answers emails and works on this project as a volunteer. Sometimes issues and faults take just days of trial and error to solve. We now think they are all solved. Michael will also be releasing documentation on how to program the iCP2 as soon as he is happy with it. I want nothing more than to show you boxes of final PCBs, I cannot wait for them to arrive! Thanks, Craig Well, a month of messing about with CAD data and it's finally working. We're sorry it took that long, we were working for 2 weeks together with the mould company to make the front plate work. The design is so odd that it was very difficult to get running right. They had never seen a design like it, well, because nothing like the iCP2 exists. The closet thing would be a mobile phone, but with many more controls and keys - or the Pandora... And that's why we have been so obsessed with getting this right. The Pandora, a previous console that some of us worked on, had a similar front plate design, and the moulding was not *quite* right on it... this resulted in many units cracking in half at the back after a few months of use. That is the sort of thing that spending extra time now stops down the line. Also, frustratingly, over Christmas my partner lost her job, I didn't want to post about this but it did cause some delays as I had to take on more work when I'd have rather been making fun iCP2 hardware/software. These things happen, she is starting a new job at the end of the month :) Here is the final iCP2 front plate design, it looks so simple, but so much work went in to getting this right: Notice that the top screw holes are the shoulder button holders., and how the other 3 are squeezed in. Dave did a great job on this. So, what now? Well it's all, finally, go. Making thousands of cases, PCBs &amp; buttons - build them, box them, ship. I'll keep posting photos as we go along. One final thing is that the holder has to be redesigned slightly due to the case itself changing shape slightly, which I'm working on this week. Also, we will also have spare units which can now be reserved, (we have made more than needed for the KS units) email <email> if you want one. Thanks for sticking with us everyone, we know you want this yesterday, we're getting there. -Craig &amp; iCP2 team. Making plastic casing is a lot harder than you might think. The moulding design for the iCP2 was complete before the KS started and matched up quite well to previous projects we had completed, it was essentially a mix of the Pandora and the iControlpad1. Then, as you know, we had to adjust the design to make room for the RGB LEDs. No big deal, right? Well with injection moulding even .3mm can lead to huge issues as we have found in the last 30 days. Thus a series of redesigns had to be done to combat flow issues. These are when the plastic, injected at enormous pressures doesn't flow correctly and leaves sink marks or unfilled areas of the metal mould which leads to deformed cases being ejected. Something so tiny (the red area), resulting in so much work: Yesterday we got the messages that the latest changes, all 0.3mm of them look like they have finally fixed the issue. We shall know before the end of the month (and have 3000 cases soon after if it's working) In other news here is a photo of the final PCB - it's actually very different from the original design due to the LED changes and also changes due to the case redesign, here is a before and after view: Before, the original iCP2 PCB: And now, the final PCBs: The case has also undergone radical changes, for style, fit and finish, such as this grip area: So, as I hope you can see, we have been working very hard to make this all as good as it can be. It looks like the final hurdles have been crossed and units will start shipping in March. We are starting to send out shipping surveys this week so keep an eye out for them. We won't be doing them all at once as we like to keep it neatly organised and deal with messages from you as we go along though each reward level, I'll tweet smaller updates as we go along (@craigix). I'll do another update as soon as we get the final cases with many photos and video. Thanks, Craig &amp; the iCP2 team. A few minor updates before mass production: So, due to new shipping regulations we only just received the batteries, the original shipment was returned by the carrier for not meeting the new packaging requirements. After much back and forth it's now sorted out. Some more photos of the RGB in action, remember these keymats are not stenciled, the final keymat will be black with clear lettering, which will lead to a very unified light across the keys. We're now just waiting on the first run of final PCBs before giving the green light for mass production. What we want to see from this final run is fully working RGB backlighting, full working integration with various devices (iOS, Android, Mac, PC etc.) and to see if there are any final board population issues. The case and board have become very slightly bigger to take the LEDs which lead to quite a lot of redesign on the case, but this is now complete (it was actually a lot more work than expected). The device itself still looks the same externally. Notice the new nipples on the keymat, these hold up the mat just enough to let the light of the LEDs shine across the whole PCB: And finally our website will switch to iCP2 mode this weekend (probably minimal at first), we will then add news, downloads and data there as well as here before shipping. One final request, please email us via our website rather than Kickstarter if possible as it's easier and faster for us to deal with emails. Next update just might have a final unit ready to ship :) Thanks for bearing with us, we have actually really enjoyed adding those LEDs, the extra time has also allowed us to find and kill a few software and hardware bugs, Craig Well, what a crazy 10 days. When the project finished we ordered a Replicator2 3D printer - we did this because when working on projects such as this you can easily spend thousands of dollars rapid prototyping design changes. So, the replicator arrived last week and the plan was to produce and present the first dev iCP2 unit today, ready to work. Unfortunately the Replicator2 is very new tech and almost instantly did this: That's a replicator2 print head which has encased itself in filament. Due to the time of year tech support took a while to get back to us and the entire top of the machine had to be dismantled and rebuilt. If you buy one of these do not take your eyes off it when it's printing, it's new tech and has some serious teething issues. However today, after much tinkering, it's working: Unfortunately there was not time to get the printed new keymat to Michael who has the RGB LED PCB. So you will have to make do with the photo at the top, which is the keymat working with a normal white LED, and it looks superb! The final version has it so the ABXY and Dpad also light up and obviously will have letters on the keys. I've already packaged up the printed keymats to send to Michael on the 27th, and you should see a final working picture as soon as they arrive with him. Then it's mass production time! Merry Christmas, Craig &amp; iCP2 team. Quick update today, the lights are alive, Red, green and blue :) The new keymat with nipples (to let the light under it all) has not yet arrived (boo!) but this is going to work, so we're excited for them to arrive. The final picture is an old sample keymat from another project laid over to show the light passes though. Don't panic, the final version won't have that many LEDs, they are just in all those locations to perfect the final positions. As suspected the battery company have delayed delivery until the 20th now (Christmas supply delays apparently...) so the backlit keyboard was the right move to make as we have lost no time at all in doing it as the batteries would have been late either way. Everything else has arrived, so PCB production can begin soon, which will make for exciting photos. Now, after all that backlighting work, to catch up on your KS private messages. We hope you're enjoying the progress reports, they will become much more detailed with PCB production. Thanks, Craig Firstly here is our first video, we actually recorded this last week but the colour somehow ended up blue so we re-recorded it today: <url>"A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad." This quote has played on my mind for the last few days, and it has been an interesting last few days - we have sourced the backlighting film required for light distribution and also built side mounted LEDs for the PCB. Next week we will order 2500 translucent keymats and backlighting films, even with Christmas coming up the manufacturer has said they will try to get these to us in 3 weeks. So we think this is worth a shot. Yes we might not be able to ship every iCP2 in time for Christmas, or we might miss Christmas all together - but the product you get will be a superior product - and that's what you will remember. In other words you're going to get the backlighting - I'll update next Friday with new photos - be assured we are going as fast as we can. Thanks, Craig &amp; the iCP2 team PS We will document how we did the backlighting and where we got the film from once we have it. PPS first video coming next week, which is about our KS experience and some very good and surprising tips and tricks which made it work. Hello everyone, We should finally have the KS money next week, pretty much a month after the funding ended. if you're planning a project it's worth knowing that time scale as we didn't plan for it to take quite that long. Now, we will be shipping the iCP1 units to those of you who ordered them as soon as the KS money arrives so look out for the email to collect your details. If you ordered both the iCP1 and iCP2 they won't ship until the iCP2 is ready. In other news we have been experimenting with LED (white and RGB) lighting for the keymat. This is, as I had feared, turning in to development hell. In order for the LEDs to be placed the case needs a modification and the keymat looks like it will need a light defusing coating. We are working on seeing if this can be done in a reasonable time. However if we don't get this working by the end of next week then we will very likely abandon the LED plans or we will end up not shipping these until Jan/Feb. I'm already worried we have spent too much time on this aspect especially with the KS money taking longer than expected to arrive. Be assured we are still seriously trying to make LED backlighting a reality but we're also aware these need to go in to production very soon. I'll give a final update on the backlighting this time next week. Do let us know how you feel about this in the comments, would you wait the extra time for backlighting or should we just push ahead and get these made and shipped for Christmas? (please be nice to each other in the comments section :) ) Thanks for all your support as always, Craig PS the picture is us testing PCB mounted LEDs on generic translucent keymat samples to try to judge the best angle for the LEDs and the best material type for light distribution. Hello everyone, Well we have now done everything we can until the Kickstarter money arrives. It might arrive in the Amazon account tomorrow if we're lucky but apparently it can then take another 7 days to transfer and then we have to transfer it again to suppliers. This could add on an extra 10 days to production in the worst case, but fingers crossed we can tie that in to the LED backlighting development/testing so not as much time is lost. We have decided we have to prototype the LED PCB and keymat at least once, we had previously hoped we could just go straight to production with them but the placing of the LEDs is so critical that we dare not make a mistake there. We have already been quoted $250 to prototype the (partially) transparant keymat and it's going ahead this week. We also have the final quote on the PCB parts and manufacture and that can be booked in this week. Also we will be shipping out the iCP1 controllers possibly this week, it depends on when the final ones arrive from Germany, those of you who pledged at that level will receive a message when we're ready. We should be caught up with the KS messages today - you can also email us on <email>. Anyhow, the main news here is really 'everything is going well... so far!'. Thanks, Craig Hello everyone, another micro update, The iCP2 batteries have now been ordered as have the protection circuits, these attach to the batteries and stop anything dangerous happening such as over charging, without this circuit the battery could potentially explode/leak and cause serious damage. You may think that every single tech device would have this protection but a significant minority of cheap electronics don't. The batteries are expected to arrive in 4 weeks, although we already have a small number here for sample purposes. The video diaries which we're recording go in to more detail about these parts and were we get them from, they will be posted next month. Thanks, Craig Hello, Some of you had problems pledging or Amazon were unable to pick up your pledge, also some of you needed to add on shipping. Until the end of the month we can help sort this out, we have a paypal account and we can use it to solve failed pledges. Please message me for the details, include what your pledge was for and I'll send you an invoice for paypal. Thanks, Craig Hello everyone, another micro update. The Bill of materials has been submitted to be ordered, this means the parts which go on the PCB will now be ordered. Sometimes it can take 4 weeks to get these all delivered so when making a device it's important to get this submitted early. We're also finishing up the final LED positions and hope to update you on this at the end of the week, like we said we want this device to move to mass production ASAP so we're trying to get this new feature added as quickly as possible. Generally adding new features at such a late date can lead to something called 'development hell' where you can cause months of delays by continually adding in features until such a point that it has cost more than it was worth. We certainly don't want to end up in that position which is why we're not going crazy with extra features and it's exactly why we didn't have any stretch goals, aside from agreeing to look at LED backlighting. We're reasonably sure this is going to work and won't add more than 10 days to mass production. Thanks, Craig Sort summary of the LED changes: The moulding begins this week! LED changes happening now. Then it's to mass production. The LED changes won't add more than 10 days or so to the schedule so we're fine, they effect the PCB (it will now be 4 layers, but you get your IR pads too) and it effects the keymat (needs holes for the LEDS). Well we will know for sure very soon. It looks like it will work. The only new issue is we have to adjust the keymat mould, it has to be that milky white colour and the stencil has to be around the letters with the letters letting the light though. Will update as soon as we have samples, we're pushing this though as fast as we can because we know you want it in there. Thanks, Craig (@craigix for micro updates) Thank you everyone, you're absolutely amazing, that's more than we dared to think we would raise! From Monday parts will be ordered, production time booked and a new video about mass production posted. You will also all get contacted to confirm details. For micro updates you can follow me on twitter @craigix. We can't wait to make this and share the process with you. Thanks, Craig Well as I'm sure you have all seen the KS is a success, and we have waited until it is well past the goal just to be sure before posting this. We're now requesting part invoices and arranging the moulding process for the rubber membranes and plastic parts - the battery company will also start production of the cells. Once the KS ends we will post the first production video and you will see us start making this real! Thanks so much everyone, we can't wait to start building and shipping these. Kickstarter is an amazing tool for funding projects, and without you and KS, I can honestly say we could not have made the iCP2. Thanks, Craig A few people found our original video a little boring, well the internet has given us short attention spans, so for a bit of fun we edited this together, it's the ALL ACTION iControlpad2 video! :) It's a bit of a spoof but we enjoyed doing it and it lightened the very stressful KS project work. PS wow - we're at 80%. Thank you all so much. We will keep working 100% on this as we really really want to make this happen. Thank you. A video about how we want to document the manufacture process, has some video of the iCP1 and iCP2 internals. <url>
