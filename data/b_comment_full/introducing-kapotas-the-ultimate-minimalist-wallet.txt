Hi Backers! After all the "where do I put my cash?"questions I received I'm happy to announce I now offer a solution! As an upgrade/option I can add a PASS-THROUGH LAYER that is large enough for a US bill folded in half. You can easily fold your bills in half and slide them into either side. They stay secure until you are ready to remove. I don't consider the upgrade a "pocket" only because it's attached at the top and bottom only- NOT a 3 sided "pocket". ( I added the belted picture at the bottom to help Illustrate this and the unintended function ) Being that it's a pass through layer it is great for both left and right handed people because you can add/remove from either side. The area is large enough for additional cards/IDs, just not as easy to remove as the outside main pocket. After wear testing this has undoubtedly become my favorite everyday carry. Great for notes, receipts, etc... This will be offered as an upgrade to any wallet going forward. I cannot add upgrade to an existing wallet. Remember backers to use your special backer coupon code for the best price available. Best Regards, Joshua www.KapotasDesigns.com Hi Backers! Quick update.
