No we haven't approached Valve about this, this will be released under a different name and concept but it will in-fact just be half-life 3, we are naming it half life 3 at present just so fans know what we are actually doing rather than coming up with a new name game from the start that people are more likely to pass by not knowing what it actually is. As this has just been brought up the '10month' timescale is not a delusion on our part. This is when we hope to deliver an alpha test for our backers in order for them to see our progress and have something back from the project. This will include some general movement and interaction play as well as previews for later graphics.
