Hello everyone, After two years, we have finally launched our next game on Kickstarter: Cunning Linguist . Cunning Linguist is a game where you make horrible definitions. BUT... the game is 100% compatible with Cards Against Humanity. We are offering the game for $15 for 550 card starter game. Check out the video and the game here . - The Offkey Media Team Hi, Long overdue, I know, but here are the drinking game rules! Play it with soda or whatever other drink you prefer. If you have ideas for additional rules, please send me a message. <url>"The John Doe Card"). Cards are being updated and the new game (F.U. Haiku) is going through its final machinations so we can send out the print and play. Fred Hi, A few people have notified us they have experienced Backerkit issues. Here is a work-around: Please go to <url>"Names and Places" deck. Just add a comment to this update! Hi, We added the fifth game play video to the site. Plus, since we hit $3,000 we added some uncensored videos to our YouTube channel . We are getting close and are excited to go into production soon. Thank you all! We are almost at the halfway point with 12 days to go. Please tell your friends about the game (or get them to watch some funny Mobscenity videos - at least we hope you find them funny). On that front, we have a more videos coming your way and will release the next one once we hit the $4,000 mark, we will release 3 of the videos without the "bleeps" on YouTube for your amusement. I was not kidding when I said I was shocked and amazed by what came out of people's mouths. We also have a great idea from Dennis on adding drinking rules for 21+ players as a reach goal - so, at $7,000 we will do exactly that. Thank you Dennis! Please keep the ideas coming, and again, please tell your friends. Thank you for your support! Thank you to Allyson for great idea for Add-Ons! To be clear with the add-ons, people cannot order more than 10 of any item offered on this Kickstarter project, based on Kickstarter rules. (For example, no one can get more than 10 copies of the core game). That being said, we have some great inexpensive add-ons for our contributors!

First and most importantly, I want to thank everyone who has contributed yet again as we move closer to our goal of $6,000. We are thrilled there is a place like Kickstarter on the Web where people like us can partner with gaming enthusiasts to make a dream a reality (no matter how perverse the resulting game may be). Second, we have updated the images on our Kickstarter project page so you can see our initial deck. We want you all to know that this is real and that we will produce a high quality product. We welcome any feedback! Third, I (Fred) will be attending Gamerati Game Days in Tacoma, WA in early February to introduce the game to local gamers (I imagine they will need to put us in a quiet corner). I am excited to work with Gamerati. If you are in the neighborhood, please stop by and say hello! We have just added this to our description. The first 108 people who contribute $30 or more will get to have their name on a card in the deck (e.g., "The John Doe Card"). Your attribution can be up to 20 characters and cannot put in someone else's name. However, you can still have fun with the naming (e.g., Seymour Butts). If you prefer to remain anonymous, that is fine to! We have just added another video of game play for you to enjoy and there are more coming. Thank you for supporting Mobscenity. We passed $1,000! FYI - We are preparing some new amusing videos to share with you! We are very excited to be at the $999 mark. Thank you to our backers for helping us reach this point! We are excited to make Mobscenity a reality. We came across a wonderful idea called Kicking It Forward ( KickingItForward.org ) where participants agree to contribute 5% of their finished product profits back into other Kickstarter projects. We have decided to join this effort in the hopes of seeing many dreams funded by Kickstarter as possible.
