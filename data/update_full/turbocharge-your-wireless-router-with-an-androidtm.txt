We realize our project is late and folks are justifiably frustrated. We shipped hardware to half of our developer backers last month and will ship to the remaining backers this month. Droidifi is late but far from dead. The Soap router team contacted us last week about their project to see if we could help them, but we have no agreement with Soap to use the Droidifi OS or any part of it and did not authorize them to use or name our project to promote theirs. We wish the Soap team success in their endeavors but we currently have no agreement or intention of working with Soap. The reason for the delay has been lack of support from the wireless chipset vendor and we are in the process of writing wireless drivers from scratch. We consider the Droidifi OS alpha quality but we have decided to release it for testing. We recommend using the Buffalo Technology WZR-1750DHP as the alpha test platform. We will post updates on our website with further instructions and new videos describing the firmware upload process. Thanks to everyone for your support! Work is progressing on Droidifi for the current generation of 802.11ac routers and we are already starting to look at the specs and hardware of the next generation due out this Summer.
