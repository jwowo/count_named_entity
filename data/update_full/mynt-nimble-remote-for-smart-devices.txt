Hi, We will release our new MYNTs at CES 2018 this year. We will be at Tech East South Hall 2 #26039. <url>’re incredibly proud of developers like Mobvoi who are dedicated to offering creative solutions through wearable technologies. In fact, the team has recently launched their Kickstarter campaign for the Ticwatch 2, an interactive and intuitive smart-watch. The device has multiple functionalities, accessed through various interactions, the most prominent innovation is the wrist flip motion activation. Aside from the typical swiping, the watch boasts its side touch strip which allows users to scroll, select, or zoom without covering the screen. You can also quickly flip your wrist to activate voice command or even make a phone call, and by flipping twice, you can hang up or answer calls hands-free. If you want to silence notifications, you can just press an open palm on the surface of the device to dim the watch to stealth mode. The Ticwatch naturally offers the usual capabilities of a smartwatch, such as access to your apps and stored data, yet possesses centralized technology, with a keen focus on fitness. With our recent update to our fitness app SLife, our dedication to a healthy and active lifestyle aligns quite well with Ticwatch’s goals. In fact, our partnership with Mobvoi allows for SLife to run without a hitch, and provides a more connected life. The Ticwatch 2 tracks fitness data, such as real-time rate, speed, distance, and GPS location. All of this activity can be easily synced up with other devices, and with the SLife app. With the Ticwatch 2 and our SLife app, your fitness can improve by leaps and bounds. Our app condenses fitness progress into digestible and meaningful data and allows users to track progress as if reliving memories. You can back the Ticwatch 2 on Kickstarter currently in exchange for their early release of the watch. Our SLife app can be downloaded for free from the app store, so you can start on achieving your fitness goals right away. We are so grateful for our partners that strive toward promoting a balanced and connected life, and hopefully you will like our partner company’s new product. Dear Supporters, Thank you for the patience you have given waiting for the Blue MYNTs. They have arrived. We currently have about 100 blue MYNTs. We will ship the remaining 12 orders that required Blue MYNTs with additional items because of the long wait. Amy is in charge of shipping the orders, and she will be back by the end of this week. Shipment will be sent starting this Saturday. Thank you for the support. Best regards, Slightech Hello all of our backers, I am pleased to announce our MYNT app 2.0 was just released! This app is totally re-designed, we hope it will bring your user experience to an entirely new level. Your MYNT app should automatically upgrade to 2.0 if you set auto app update in your phone settings. If not, you can go to App Store or Google Play, look for “updates” section. 1. Totally re-designed GUI, stylish and intuitive. It’s flat, neat, and simple. When you opened MYNT 2.0 app for the first time, it will detect your MYNTs (make sure you put your MYNTs nearby), telling you there is a new firmware available. After you press the MYNT icon, it will automatically upgrade the firmware through the air. The update process will take a couple of minutes. Once the firmware update complete, it will pop up a message asking you to disable Bluetooth and then enable Bluetooth. This message will only last about 5 seconds. You may not see it if you walk away during firmware upgrade. Then, it will automatically re-connect your MYNT to you phone. You will see a message pop up, asking you to pair the MYNT with your phone, choose “Yes”. Now in each MYNT setting, there are two sections: Remote and Tracker. There is a few pre-set use configuration that you can use, and you can also choose “Custom,” then configure it yourself. For “Remote,” you can set single click, double click, triple click, long press to play music or take photos. The slides clicker now even works in Keynote on your iPhone and iPad. For the first time you open the app, the MYNT app will even pop up messages to explain the function of each icon in the app. 2. No false alarm and much faster re-connecting speed MYNT 2.0 is using a new way to connect your phone and MYNT. This will virtually eliminate false alarms, and the re-connecting speed is much faster than the previous version. You can disable MYNT alarm in your home or office by setting the “Safe Zone”. Tap the menu at the top left on the home page, then tap “Settings” at the bottom, you will see the Same Zone settings. If you don’t want MYNT to alarm in Safe Zones, make sure you switch on the “Disable MYNT alarm” to “On” (the default is “Off”). You can also customize whether you want MYNT and phone to give you signal in each MYNT settings. 3. The remote function now works in native apps and third-party apps. This new enhancement is SUPER COOL! You may notice the camera and music control icon on the home page are gone in this version, that’s because now you can use MYNT to control the native camera and music app on your phone, plus all kind of third party camera and music apps, like Instagram, Spotify. You can configure your MYNT remote function in each MYNT’s Setting page. Note: 1. Per user’s suggestion, we have changed the “Find Phone” behavior. When you press and hold the MYNT button, your phone will keep ringing until you release the button. 2. “Long press for find phone” is the default setting in MYNT 2.0. When you switch to other pre-set remote control configurations, the long press is configured to other functions. 3. To change the name and picture of MYNT, you just need to tap the MYNT icon in MYNT settings, it will show up. 4. There is still not possible to choose different alarm sound. We are working on that in our next release. I hope you will like MYNT 2.0. If you like this upgrade, we would appreciate you share this new experience on Kickstarter (comments) and Amazon (reviews). You may still experience bugs on some Android phones, since there are so many different Android phones out there, and they all modified the Android system in some ways. When you find bugs, please let us know, and we will debug it and fix the bug in our next release. In general, if your phone type is listed on our website, the problem is related to the user setting. The best way to solve the problem will be following the tutorials and video guides. BTW, our first bunch of blue MYNTs just arrived! We will start shipping them out on Monday. For backers who ordered blue MYNT, you should receive it by end of this week. Enjoy Super Bowl 50 and Happy Valentines Day! Leo Founder of MYNT We did it! You have helped us to make MYNT a reality.
