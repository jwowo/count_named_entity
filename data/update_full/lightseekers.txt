Greetings Lightseekers! We wanted to send one final Kickstarter update to let you know that all backer rewards have now been sent. If you have any questions about your rewards or believe you did not receive rewards that you were expecting, please let us know via email at <email>. We cannot thank you enough for all of your support over the past year. Please continue to follow us on social media and visit our forums. If you ever have any questions, please don't hesitate to email us at <email>. Happy Holidays and a Happy New Year to all of you! Best wishes for an amazing 2018. See you on the forums and don't forget to rotate your buffs! - The Lightseekers Team at PlayFusion Hello Lightseekers! In the next 24 hours, we will be sending out your in-game download code to claim some of your digital rewards! Be sure to look for an email from BackerKit that includes instructions on how to enter your unique code into the Lightseekers app. To enter your code just go straight to the in-game settings menu. Tap the "CLAIM KICKSTARTER REWARDS" button and enter your code, that's it. Once you have entered a valid code you will get this confirmation screen: The first group of backer rewards are already in-game waiting to be unlocked. The second group will be coming in the next game update (more detail below). You only need to enter your code once. As soon as the upcoming game update is released, your remaining game rewards will be there waiting for you. Backers will get different in-game digital rewards based on their pledge level or add-ons. The email you receive from BackerKit will outline what you're getting. Or, if you prefer, you can doublecheck your backer level in Kickstarter. The Rewards Below is where to find each of the rewards in-game, happy hunting! Pets Remember this guy? This is Glacius and (thanks to all our fantastic backers who pushed us past our first stretch goal) everyone will be unlocking him to use in-game. There are up to 4 total new pets available depending on your backer level and they all appear in your inventory as a pet collar waiting to be hatched, exactly the same as any pet you discover normally in-game. Simply select a pet collar and use it to be taken to the pets screen where it can be summoned to join you in battle! Character call-outs It's not just us here at PlayFusion who think you guys are great...Jax, Kora, Boulder and Zyrus love you too and are happy to tell you! Once you have entered your code, simply jump back to the main menu and start an Adventure Game with any of your Lightseekers figures turned on. Make sure your figure volume is turned up, the guys want to thank you personally! What the figures say is dependent on your backer level. New Dungeon Grubby Den is a beautiful crystal cave dungeon that desperately needs to become Kreebal-free. This new dungeon is easily accessed by tapping on the blue dungeon portal in Safehaven and selecting Grubby Den. Exclusive enemies and exclusive loot await within! New Quest Area Accessible from the green map portal in Safehaven is the intriguing new quest area of Drifting Plateaus. Help Dr Gunshine's expedition get to the fabled treasure cave filled with chests holding loot from across Tantos. Select the Drifting Plateaus option from the map portal to access. December game update The next update, with you before Christmas, is a big one. It's been a great year here at PlayFusion with lots going on so it is nice to finally get all our backer rewards into the game...along with some other new things. Kickstarter Rewards Character titles and visual customization for backers will both become available. More details are coming closer to the update (we're still working on them). You won't have to enter any codes though, as the content will be available for you at the next update - just download and play. NPC naming - Some of our backers wanted to name their own NPC and we've been adding these in where possible as we've gone along but what we really needed was a big new map to put them all in. We've got one now and it is chock full of your NPCs. Big, New Map - Savage Sands It's time to continue the story and Savage Sands is the new map in the heart of the tyrax desert lands. The hunt for General Carnage gathers pace...new quests, new repeatables, new puzzles, world bosses, hidden treasures and toy exclusive content. There are also new faction vendors, new pets and new loot! New Dungeon - Pit of Despair The Pit of Despair is a Storm dungeon on the edge of the rift with waves of attacking umbron disembarking from airships. Good Times at the Riftside Resort The mari oasis Riftside Resort has been under construction for a while now and Sandy-B's Smoothie Bar is now open for business. That's about it for this update. All black limited edition figures have now been shipped. Look out for your email from BackerKit in the next 24 hours for your code (check your Spam folder if you don't see it in your inbox) and the next update will be with you before Christmas. ...and finally We are putting together the remaining non-game digital rewards (digital art book, digital soundtrack) right now and they will be with you soon. Check your emails for links! Thank you to everyone for staying with us on this journey and supporting us along the way, it is always appreciated. As always, please let us know if you have any feedback or questions regarding your rewards. - The Lightseekers Team Hello Lightseekers! It's been a while since we last posted an update - and there's been a lot going on! Figures, accessories, and trading cards have been on sale in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia. We've been attending events all across the US and UK introducing Lightseekers to as many new fans as possible. Our community has been growing rapidly and we have all of you to thank for helping get us started. We appreciate your patience and understanding over the last few months. Here are some key updates: Figures &amp; Accessories Wave 2 items are currently on sale in the US at Toys"R"Us and Amazon and in Canada via Amazon . These items include Tech and Storm Shields, 2-Handed Tech and Storm Weapons, 1-Handed Dread and Mountain Weapons, and Dread and Mountain Flight Packs. These items are now available for pre-order via Amazon in the UK and they'll start shipping in early November. Our two new Heroes (Zyrus and Boulder) will be available as Hero Packs within the next week on Amazon in the US and rolling out to other countries in November. These characters have already been programmed into the Lightseekers game so they're ready to go as soon as these figures get into your hands. Trading Cards Response to the Lightseekers Trading Card Game has been outstanding and we're working on a new TCG website and mobile app. Fan and single card sales sites such as deliverycrab.com , rotatingbuff.co.uk , seekerhaven.com , and the Online Lightseekers League have started to appear. We're also excited to announce that Lightseekers is now listed on tcgplayer.com as well. These sites will help you find the cards you need to build the ultimate custom deck. We're currently building out plans and kits for organized play. Our first competitive tournament will take place at PAX Unplugged on November 17-19 in Philadelphia, PA . We have plans for soon-to-be-announced regional and national tournaments for the US and UK in 2018. We're in the process of reaching out to hobby shops to increase product availability and opportunities for organized play. If you know of any stores who may be interested in carrying Lightseekers, please email their store information to <email>. We're also looking for fans who'd like to become part of our Lightseekers TCG Envoy program. Envoys help spread the word about the Lightseekers TCG and help teach others the game. If you're interested, please email us at <email>. We have card expansions planned for 2018, so stay tuned for more information coming soon! Rewards We know that we're a little late to deliver the Digital Rewards that we promised as part of our campaign. We appreciate your patience and understanding. Look for an email from us around the first two weeks of November with instructions on how to access the first batch of Digital Rewards (pets, voice over clips, dungeons, quests, digital art book, digital soundtrack, and some NPC names). Some of the other rewards (character/weapon skins and titles) will follow afterwards and we're aiming to complete them as soon as possible. Unfortunately, we are not going to deliver a Mac/PC version of the game this year. We've been working hard on a solution, but the experience we can deliver is not up to the high standards we hold for ourselves and we don't want to let you down after you've waited so long. If you pledged for the Digital Pioneer Pack, we'd like to offer you figures or trading cards as a substitute or a full refund. To make this happen, please email us at <email>. For those of you who pledged $300 or more, we have good news for you. The limited edition black figures are in en route from China and are due to arrive at our offices in the next week. There is some work we need to do to them before shipping them out, but we expect them to arrive in your hands before the end of November. In addition, you will not be required to send back your limited edition gold figures or show proof of their destruction. It's hard to believe our Kickstarter campaign kicked off just over one year ago. We've come so far since then - and we couldn't have done it without your patience and support. Thanks so much to all of you and, as always, please let us know if you have any questions or feedback. - The Lightseekers Team Hello Lightseekers and Happy Weekend!!! It's been a couple of weeks, so we thought we'd update you on our progress. Big thanks to Jane and Sophie who have been working tirelessly to get all the beta prototypes out the door. We began shipping out prototypes earlier this week and they should arrive for all backers (who pledged $300 or more) within the next couple of days. Since we're shipping all over the world from the UK, arrival times will vary based on geography but they all should be received prior the beta launch on February 15th. A few backers haven't yet agreed to the terms of the physical beta - please note that must be done before we can ship the beta prototypes. If you've pledged $300+ and haven't received/returned your physical beta agreement, please check your email (and your spam folder) and, as always, reach out to us with any questions. We'd like to introduce you to General Carnage - the leader of the sinister and deadly umbron. Are you scared or do you think you can take him down? The kreebal are a race that trace far back in the history of Tantos. Generally speaking, they can be considered intelligent...but not very. They are prone to violence and have been a minor threat to the peaceful races for as long as can be remembered. Living in small tribes, their day-to-day lives seem to mostly consist of thinking up weird reasons to start wars with whoever happens to live nearby. The mari are throwing a party? That means war! The tyrax are building a machine? Oh, that definitely means war! These wars, however, typically don't go very well for them, but at the very least they provide a bit of entertainment for the other residents of Tantos. Here's sneak peek of our Trading Card Game packaging. It's all coming together! We'd really love to hear what you think about them. Which order are you most excited to play? Finally, it's time for Episode #7 of AskPlayFusion. This episode focuses specifically on your questions about the upcoming beta. Here it is for your viewing pleasure: <url>’ve been discussing this extensively as a team. As a result we’re altering our release schedule slightly to give beta participants longer to get to grips with the game and solicit your feedback. Naturally this will slightly impact on the initial beta dates in that they’ll be a little later for most backers but the benefit is you’ll have an extended beta window as a result. We’re going to be running the Lightseekers beta in stages, this will allow us time to get your feedback and iterate on the game over and over to ensure we make the best game possible. 25th January - Beta digital action figures begin arriving We are working tirelessly to get all the figures tested and firmware updated ready for the beta, as soon as this is completed - we expect a week from now based on the time taken so far to get half way.... we will then begin shipping them to the community around the world. 15th February - Closed Beta This is where things really get interesting. The first Closed Beta (both physical and digital) will be for all our backers (from the relevant Kickstarter tiers) to playtest the Lightseekers game at as close to full launch quality as we can at this stage. It is still a beta and our test at scale so there is a possibility that not everything will be perfect but the data and feedback from our beta testers at this stage will still be invaluable to us and really help shape the experience for the next milestones. There will be an NDA (non disclosure agreement) in place during this time so please do not stream, or make videos of the game or photos of the figures and accessories. Whilst participants will have early privileged access to the Lightseekers universe, we really want to try our best to keep as much of it a surprise and "wow" for the rest of the community too so please please pretty please - no spoilers! 15th March - Closed Beta Phase 2 We will really be ramping up the number of invited players and delivering lots of new content for the community to enjoy. 17th April - Open Access We will be opening the full game to everyone across iOS, Android and Mobile and Tablet devices with official PC and Mac support coming shortly afterwards. Your figures and starter packs should arrive a bit later on but before retail stores so backers will get theirs before the general public. <url>’ve requested including private messaging, polls and badges you can unlock. More importantly the new forum system allows us to create a dedicated private area especially for beta testers where you can give your feedback and discuss the game with our developers and QA teams! We’re really looking forward to the switch over and will let you know when it’s ready, in the meantime do be sure to sign up so that you’re all ready to go! It’s going to be a really exciting year for Lightseekers and we’re going to be working incredibly hard to bring you the best possible experience on these dates. We know some of the dates are now a little later than initially planned but we want to assure you that these dates are now all firmly set in stone. Thank you once again for all your support and helping us get this far, we are beyond grateful to everyone who has backed us, supported us, "liked us" and generally encouraged us - our team really want to repay you all multiple times over with enjoyment and delight. -The Lightseekers Team Happy New Year Lightseekers! We hope you had a wonderful holiday season. Yesterday we received the most wonderful gift of all – our physical beta test figures arrived at our office! They took a little longer to arrive due to some delays at customs, but they look amazing and we couldn’t possibly be more excited! It took our entire team a few hours to unload the truck. The next step for us is to flash the firmware on each FusionCore. This is a manual process which should take us a little time. We flashed the first one last night and we’re pleased to report that everything worked exactly as planned. Those you of who will be participating in the physical beta test, please keep an eye out for an email that will arrive next week. It will include a few legal documents that you will need to review and agree to. Once we have your agreement, then we will be able to ship your physical beta test figures to you. Reports from China are positive regarding toy production. We're keeping a close eye on the potential impact of Chinese New Year when factories close down for almost a month. Hopefully this won’t impact our production timeline too much. We are excited to share with you some new Wave 2 accessories that we’ve developed in addition to what was revealed during our Kickstarter campaign. New one handed weapons Later this year, we’ll be introducing some new one handed weapons themed around the Dread and Mountain Orders. These will have their own special abilities and are compatible with all Lightseekers Heroes. Two handed weapons We’ve also developed our first two handed weapons for the Tech and Storm Orders. Two handed weapons take up both weapon slots on your character but offer additional firepower. The two currently in the works are the Storm themed Tempest Rod, a crushing melee weapon and the Tech themed C-Tech Cannon, a powerful firearm that packs a serious punch! New Flight Packs We’ll be releasing two new flight packs themed around the Mountain and Dread Orders. These are compatible with all Lightseekers Heroes, include special abilities, and unlock new areas of the game. Shields! In Wave 2, you’ll be able to give yourself some extra protection with our collection of Storm and Tech themed shields! These offer defensive bonuses and also unlock their own unique skills. They take up a weapon slot on your action figure so you can attack and defend yourself at the same time. It’s been an exciting start to the new year. Thanks so much for your support. We can’t wait to bring Lightseekers to life in 2017!!! - The Lightseekers Team Hello Lightseekers Backers! Thanks so much to all of you who have completed your backer surveys. We've received over 1,100 completed surveys so far - with ten days to go before the lock-down date. If you haven't done so already, it’s important that you complete the survey as soon as you can so that we can get your rewards to you as quickly, easily, and accurately as possible. The survey should take less than five minutes to complete. If you did not receive your survey, please look in your spam folder or CLICK HERE and we'll re-send it! Please reach out to us with any questions or concerns. As you all know, one of our Kickstarter community rewards was to celebrate a Follower of the Month on Twitter and a Fan of the Month on Facebook . We're delighted to reveal that on Twitter we selected the extremely dedicated @HumanGammaBomb and on Facebook the tenacious David Krout! Congratulations to both of you, you'll each be receiving a goody bag full of Lightseekers themed merchandise! We also wanted to share with you the results of the naming and location polls - our fans have spoken: Pet name: Glacius NPC name: Chronax Location to reveal next: Ashwood Thanks for all of your continued support. Please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions and we'll get back to you as quickly as we can. - The Lightseekers Team Hello Awesome Lightseekers Backers, Great news – our survey testing has been going well – and we’ll be sending Reward Surveys via email beginning Monday November 21st . (Rather than sending them over the weekend, we want to make sure we have plenty of people on hand to answer any potential questions you may have.) The purpose of this update is to provide clear instructions about the survey process. We have partnered with BackerKit, a respected organization within the crowdfunding community, to help make the survey and shipment process run as smoothly as possible. It’s important that you complete the survey as soon as you can so that we can get your rewards to you as quickly, easily, and accurately as possible. The survey should take less than five minutes to complete. Please note that your credit card has already been charged for the amount that you pledged (and thank you again for your support!). This survey will allow you to select the items you want, change your reward level, allocate your pledge across different add-ons, or increase your pledge to include additional add-ons. Please be sure to use all available credits as we cannot give refunds. Survey Email Your survey will be sent to the same email address that you used to pledge with on Kickstarter. When you get your survey, be sure to click on the "Click Here to Respond" button. Here is a snapshot of what the email will look like: Get Started Page Next, you'll see a page that looks like this: It will list how much you pledged, the pledge level (or reward pack) that you selected, and your country for shipping. If you would like to switch your pledge level, you can click on “Want to switch your pledge level?” (circled in red above). If you don’t want to switch your pledge level, click the green box to get started. Survey Questions Next, you will be asked no more than five questions about the pledge level you’ve chosen. Depending on your pledge level, these questions may include which hero or starter pack you want, how you want your name to appear in the game credits, confirmation of your email address for delivery of digital items, and why you chose to back Lightseekers. Add-Ons Then, you will have an opportunity to choose add-ons! This is done in a similar way to online shopping. You can choose specific items and add them to your cart. Any difference between your pledge and reward level will be listed as an available credit to be allocated. (In the example below, a backer made a $200 pledge for a $150 reward level, leaving $50 in available credit to apply towards add-ons.) If you’d like to increase your pledge at this time to include more add-ons, you can do this as well. You will be asked for your credit card information only if you select add-ons beyond your original pledge amount. There are no incremental shipping fees beyond what was already outlined during our Kickstarter campaign (although digital-only backers from AUS/NZ/LATAM who add-on physical items to their orders may incur a small shipping fee). If you are assessed a shipping charge of $999.99 this is because we are unable to ship physical items to countries outside of United States, Canada, Latin America*, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. If this happens, remove the physical items from your order and/or contact us at the email below with any questions regarding shipping fees or unusable credits due to shipping issues. *Unfortunately, we are unable to ship to Mexico or Brazil. Shipping You will only be asked to enter your shipping address if you are receiving any physical items. Information about digital items will be sent to you via email (you will be sent a link to download any digital or in-game rewards). Confirmation &amp; Credit Card Information The final page allows you to review your order and add your credit card information if you selected add-ons beyond your original pledge amount. Be sure to click “confirm” to ensure we receive your order. Other Important Information You must complete your survey before the lock-down date of Friday December 9, 2016 . After that, your order cannot be changed or modified via the BackerKit survey. After the lock-down date, we have to confirm your selections manually which is a much more time consuming and difficult process for you (and we don't want that!). Please note that you will still be able to change your shipping address up until we’re ready to ship your order. Credit card charges for any add-on purchases beyond your initial pledge will be processed on Monday December 12, 2016. Again, thanks so much for backing our campaign and for all your continued support. If you have any questions, please contact BackerKit at <url>#contact-us or email us at <email>. - The Lightseekers Team Hello Lightseekers! Our campaign has come to an end, but it's just the beginning for us. We're full speed ahead on game development and production of our figures, accessories, and cards. We couldn't have done it without your tremendous support, and thanks to all of you, we finished strong! This is our first Kickstarter and 50% of our backers are new to Kickstarter. So many of us are learning as we go. The next step is for us to send you a survey that allows you to provide your mailing address for shipment of physical items, enter your email address for delivery of digital items, and select which specific items you'd like to receive (sizes, designs, characters, decks, etc.). It is a pretty complex process for us (that we want to make as easy as possible for you) and we only get to send it once, so we're going to take our time to get it right. Our goal is to send you the survey in about two weeks. Since we finished the campaign strong yesterday, we unlocked a stretch goal and a new community goal. First, since we hit $225,000, every backer will receive a Tier 1 in-game pet. This is exclusive to our Kickstarter backers, so there will only be 1,635 of these pets in existence. In addition, we hit 40,000 Facebook Fans! That means we'll be announcing our Facebook Fan of The Month at the end of November. Make sure you follow us on Facebook for your chance to win. We have been providing updates frequently during our campaign. From now on, we'll switch to weekly updates. We want to respect your time and email inbox. The updates will include the latest on beta test timing, figure and card production, delivery dates for physical items, and how to access your in-game rewards. If you have any questions at any time, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We'll continue to reply to messages and comments on Kickstarter, on our social pages, and on the Forums at Lightseekers.com . On behalf of everyone at PlayFusion, thank you so much for giving us the opportunity to turn our vision into reality - it wouldn't be possible without your support! - The Lightseekers Team Hello Lightseekers! The last 30 days have been an amazing ride. Thanks for being with us every step of the way! With only 17 hours to go, we're only a few thousand dollars away from unlocking our first stretch goal (an exclusive pet for all backers) and less than two hundred Facebook fans away from unlocking another community goal reward (Facebook Fan Of The Month)! To celebrate the end of our Kickstarter campaign, please join us tomorrow on Facebook Live at 3:30pm UK time (which is 11:30am EDT/8:30am PDT). This live stream is a reward that was unlocked when we smashed our community goal of 35,000 Facebook fans. Come prepared with questions for the PlayFusion team and be ready for a few fun surprises. If you can't join live, be sure to catch the action later in the day on Facebook . You don't want to miss it! If you have any last minute questions, please let us know. But don't worry, we're not going anywhere. We'll continue to reply to messages and comments on Kickstarter, on our social pages, and on the Forums at Lightseekers.com. We'll also send backer updates to keep you up to date on our progress as we begin beta testing and production of our figures and cards. Talk soon, - The Lightseekers Team Hello Lightseekers! With only 40 hours left, and by popular demand, we'd like to introduce one more add-on. Many of you have backed the $50, $60, or $99 reward levels and have asked us for the ability to add-on pets. The Digital Mini-Pack includes three Kickstarter exclusive pets and an in-game quest area that can be added to your pledge for only $10. In addition, we've added a second T-shirt design. You can now choose from either the colorful Bubblefish or black and white Six Orders design. Each Augmented Reality T-Shirt can be added-on to your pledge for just $15. To get an optional add-on, click “Manage my Pledge” in the top right corner of the Kickstarter page and input the total value of everything you want. For example, if you’re at Physical Pioneer Pack ($60) and want to add on a T-Shirt ($15), enter $75 as your total pledge. When the campaign has finished, we will send you a survey. You will be able to select the design and size that you want and let us know what you would like for your pledge. We're SO CLOSE to unlocking our first stretch goal - an exclusive Tier 1 pet for all Kickstarter backers. Thanks so much for your continued support! - The Lightseekers Team Hello Lightseekers! There's only 60 hours left to go! Many of you have asked for a Lightseekers T-Shirt, so here it is! For just $15 you can add this awesome Augmented Reality T-Shirt to your pledge. The front features the six orders in white and the back features the Lightseekers logo. Scan your shirt with the Lightseekers game for awesome augmented reality effects. To get an optional add-on, click “Manage my Pledge” in the top right corner of the Kickstarter page and input the total value of everything you want. For example, if you’re at Physical Pioneer Pack ($60) and want to add on a T-Shirt ($15), enter $75 as your total pledge. When the campaign has finished, we will send you a survey. You will be able to select the size that you want and let us know what you would like for your pledge. We're also pleased to announce that Lightseekers has passed 5,000 Twitter followers! Reaching that community goal means you've unlocked a new reward. Later this month, we'll be announcing the first Lightseekers Twitter Follower of the Month. Be sure to follow Lightseekers on Twitter for your chance to win. You're also extremely close to reaching community goals for Facebook Fans and YouTube Subscribers . Help unlock more rewards - there's only 60 hours left! Thanks for all of your support these past three weeks. We couldn't have done it without you. Let's finish strong so we can unlock stretch goals for everyone!!! - The Lightseekers Team Hello Lightseekers! On behalf of everyone at PlayFusion, we'd like to thank every single one of our 1,310 backers who helped us reach our goal of $200,000. Thanks to you, Lightseekers is now full speed ahead! We're incredibly appreciative and energized by your support. With one week left, there's still time to reach some of our stretch goals which unlock even more rewards for our amazing Kickstarter backers. Many of you have asked about the 888 limited edition smart action figures that you get to keep as part of the $300 pledge levels and above. Here is a sneak peek of the tyrax - it is a rendering of what the figure may look like. It is not final, so it could change a bit between now and when we produce them. What do you think? And finally, because you helped us surpass 1,500 Twitter followers (now over 4,300!), you've unlocked another community goal reward. This time, you get to name a non-player character in the Lightseekers game! (See below) Master of quantum theory, the Warden of Time guards the precious tyrax secrets of temporal variance. Should his name be General Relativity, Chronax, or Quantum?!? CLICK HERE TO CAST YOUR VOTE! Have a wonderful weekend and thank you all so much for your support! - The Lightseekers Team Hello Lightseekers! With just about 8 days to go, we're at 82% of our goal! We cannot thank you enough for all of your support and encouragement. Please tell all of your friends to back us so we can finish strong! Thanks to our 30,000 rabid Facebook Fans, you've unlocked another community goal reward. This time, you get to help us name a pet in the Lightseekers game. A pretty cool customer, this slippery pet is part slime and part combat icicle. What should it's name be?!? CLICK HERE TO CAST YOUR VOTE! We've also added a new video to our campaign page featuring TOMY Design Director Alpesh who shows us what makes the Lightseekers action figures so special. You can view the video here: <url>“Manage my Pledge” in the top right corner of the Kickstarter page and input the total value of everything you want. For example, if you’re at Physical Pioneer Pack ($60) and want to add on an Electro Eel Storm Order Weapon ($10), enter $70 as your total pledge. When the campaign has finished, we will send you a survey. You will be able to select the characters and weapons that you want and let us know what you would like for your pledge. We've also just posted Episode #4 of #AskPlayFusion, where Nick answers questions about Lightseekers posed by members of our community. Here it is for your viewing pleasure: <url>#AskPlayFusion. We want to hear from you and we look forward to answering any questions you may have. Next week, we'll be delivering two new community goal unlock polls where you'll be able to name an in-game pet and an NPC. So stay tuned for further updates. Have a wonderful weekend and thanks again for all your support! - The Lightseekers Team Hello Lightseekers! What a whirlwind two weeks its been - thanks to your tremendous support! We've seen ALL TEN of our $1,000 Designer Packs get claimed and (as of this writing) there are ONLY TWELVE $500 Completionist Packs remaining! While that's pretty awesome, it's also left us with quite a sizable gap between our $300 Legendary Pack and the $10k Lightseeker Pack. Some of you have expressed interest in some of the $10k elements if offered at a lower reward tier. So we've decided to add another reward level - the $2,500 Lightseeker "Light" Pack. It includes everything in the $10k pack except attending the VIP launch party and going for a crushing ride in Bertha, the PlayFusion tank. There will only be 20 of these packs available. This pack includes a one-of-a-kind, customized Lightseekers Laser Engraved iPad Pro (12.9" 128GB). You can work with our design team to select your favorite character and approve the artwork prior to engraving. We've also received a handful of questions about the $10k pack as well. If you are interested in this pack, please message us and we can work with you on specific details. We've found this to be extremely helpful for the two awesome backers who've already pledged at this level. While this reward does not include airfare, we will cover travel expenses for you and a guest from anywhere in England to Cambridge and back. Our VIP launch party has not yet been scheduled, but we'll give you plenty of notice so you can plan ahead. Also, we're pretty flexible so we're happy to host you and a guest for a team meet-and-greet and tank ride on a different date or time that works best for you.

For your viewing pleasure, Alan and Tobias have pulled together another episode of #AskPlayFusion. This time featuring our very own Benny (looking slightly less creepy than in our $50k thank you video). If you have questions you'd like us to answer, you can always put them in the comments section or post them on social media with the hashtag #AskPlayFusion. Maybe you'll be featured in our next video! <url>“Manage my Pledge” in the top right corner of the Kickstarter page and input the total value of everything you want.

Recently we added the option to add a card starter deck from one of the six Orders onto your Kickstarter pledge. Some of you rightly pointed out that you don’t know all that much about how each order plays so to make things simpler we’ve broken them down into the Orders and their Elements! Astral Astral is heavily influenced by the past as well as the future. What is at the top of your discard pile and what is coming next from the deck is of great importance. Solar - Plan ahead to align your discard pile in order to achieve heavy burst damage. Lunar - Chain with damage and utility for increased survivability as well as damage output. Gravity - Helps you in enabling your card chains and generating a bigger hand size. Dread Dread overwhelms the target with 'damage over time' effects while suppressing their ability to fight back. Poison - Apply steady trickle damage and amplify that damage. Death - Leech health from targets and turn it into healing for yourself. Shadow - Supplements Poison and Death, and strengthens the Order's late game potential by returning cards from the discard pile. Mountain Mountain is a jack-of-all-trades Order with strong combo defences and sustained protection. Fire - A steady output of attack damage and methods to keep a wounded enemy down. Earth - Preemptive damage mitigation and slow but steady healing. Crystal - Complement your attack bursts with delayed damage spikes and defences after getting attacked. Nature Nature gains most power when it carefully tends to its buffs and draws strength from the state of its opponent. Animal - Command the beasts of nature to fight for you, through a mix of sustained damage from buffs and attacks timed at the right opportunity. Forest - While lacking reliable burst heals, Forest has tools to prevent falling too far behind and slowing down the tempo until its potential has fully grown. Soul - Helps you protect and maintain your pool of buffs, and also lets you take advantage of its growth. Storm Storm has ways to play cheaper and more powerful combos, and is also good at dealing with buff threats, but at the cost of good buff protection for itself. Lightning - Contains a steady supply of attack damage and ways to set up for bursts. Water - Provides a good array of spike healing and long term damage reduction. Air - Provides a variety of means to play combos more easily as well as making them more powerful. Tech The somewhat unsafe inventions of the tyrax pack a bigger punch than most other cards, but also put you in greater danger. Use the power of Time to make the most out of them! Explosives - Has a lot of delayed, heavy hitting buffs, but many of them will also catch you in the explosion. Mechanical - Allows you to make the most out of your crazy inventions, to provide some survivability in the chaos. Time - Lets you mess around with Time itself to change the state of buffs and move cards between the past, present, and future. Rewards Chart Following your feedback we have added a rewards grid image onto the page which shows what you will receive from each pledge tier. If you have specific rewards in mind and what to identify which package will get you the best selection then this should help a lot! Booster Pack add on As well as adding a Starter Pack onto your order you can now add 4 Booster packs!
