Dear Backers, We did it! It was a rollercoaster of a ride, but thanks to all of you we've produced the only drone built to autonomously capture your adventures in action sports! Shipping AirDog's to all Kickstarter backers was a priority for us, but the goal has always been far more difficult than just that. We aspire to create a company which develops not only the ultimate solution for self produced content, but also inspires people to get out there and experience the incomparable feeling of doing what you love and letting go of everything else. It's these moments that give us the drive to push forward and to never stop. We wish to give our utmost respect and love to all who have been with us through this stage, your importance will never be forgotten! <url>’re introducing a regular update series in which we’ll not only be sharing videos but tips and tricks and more. This is the first step of many more to come towards the communication between all of you and all of us. To stay tuned be sure to follow us at: www.airdog.com/blog We can't thank you enough for being a part of this endeavor in creating the first Action Sports Drone! We are just getting started! AirDog Team Dear Backers, Getting all of the rework done at the factory has taken longer than planned, but we have good news to share. Starting from this week, we will ship out the final batches of AirDogs every 2 weeks. Tests have concluded that all flaws that we've previously found and told you about have been solved and we are ready to resume shipping. Those of you who are in the next batch have already received an email to confirm your shipping details and the next batch of recipients will be receiving a similar email to confirm their shipping details. Things are moving along! Have a good week! AirDog Team Dear Founders, Things have been rolling along and we’ve got a short update for you. GPS Module A few updates ago we told you about some GoPro models affecting the GPS signal. We resolved the issue by moving the GPS module and antenna. Andrejs our Electronics Engineer explains it a little further: “Once we discovered the problem with GoPro interference on the GPS module we tried to use EMI absorption materials to reduce the interference. These techniques however proved ineffective and the only option was to move the GPS module further away from the noise source. Several new locations for the module were considered, but through rigorous testing and many test flights it was determined that the best location was locating it in the drone’s rear right ‘wing’ as shown in the images. The relocation of the module dramatically reduced noise interference from the camera without hindering GPS performance. The proximity of the battery was a serious consideration. We were worried that this could be detrimental to GPS positioning accuracy, however flight test showed otherwise.” Though there were various reservations about the placement of the GPS module, test after test proved we were in the clear. The photo below is of a prototype showcasing the new GPS module placement. Batch #2 The most time consuming part of this GPS module update is the reassembly for the AirDogs we have manufactured. In addition to this we’re recalibrating the gyros and accelerometers in accordance with the new software update that engages sensor heating. Once that’s done its just the basic tests and the first part of Batch #2 goes out. Our initial deadline for this rework moved slightly to the second week of May due to some component lead time. Next week we will send out surveys to re-confirm shipping addresses to the next backers in line. Share your footage Once you’re familiar with your AirDog and getting some great footage, we’d love to feature and share your videos. So when you upload your videos or photos, use #airdog or #actionsportsdrone so we can easily find it. Winter Sports Lookback The snow is all but gone and our guys testing AirDog are switching gears a bit, so here’s a look back at last season’s shots from beta testers and various shoots, can’t wait for the next winter! <url>"see" the horizon which is critical to maintain the desired attitude of the aircraft during flight. Both sensors are very sensitive to temperature changes. When you calibrate these sensors there is one temperature but then it can be very different when it needs to fly. Over the last year we’ve been using software compensation to deal with this issue but after receiving data from our beta tester community we realized that software alone wasn’t solving this issue, so in the latest software update we have engaged sensor heating which we implemented in our hardware design a year ago. So now, regardless of the ambient temperature, sensors inside AirDog will be heated to a constant temperature which is maintained during the whole operation. You might wonder what's the benefit to you as a user? It has improved safety and the need for calibration should now be almost eliminated. Feedback over the first week has been very positive and we are very happy to see that we could significantly improve user experience. Improved User Interface and Experience When we shipped the first AirDogs to our beta testers our main concern was if AirLeash and all dedicated sports flight modes will be easy enough to use. It turned out that the majority of users were very positive about the performance and their experience with AirDog in flight, though we received a lot of constructive criticism about the user experience in preflight procedures. We invested a lot of work since January to make everything super easy to understand by adding lots of animations and textual tips that show up on AirLeash display. This especially applies to sensor check and calibration process. So those in Batch #2 (late April) will get your AirDog pre-calibrated in the factory with heated sensors and getting your AirDog in the air will be a breeze. While a majority of you are still waiting due to numerous hardware related delays in manufacturing, we are doing our best to improve AirDog's performance, reliability and user experience. Batch #2 Late April the next batch is rolling off of the conveyer belt and after some quick tests it will be shipped. We will keep you posted on exact dates as the shipping day comes closer. DJI &amp; Airdog You must remember that in October we experienced a major ESC failure problem. Now it's official , DJI did a great job and helped us solve this issue by developing a custom controller for Airdog. Since both companies recognize that our products and markets are quite different and DJI has invaluable engineering expertise we feel like this partnership could grow even stronger in future and ESC's might not be the only components that are manufactured by the current market leader in consumer drones. Have a nice day (or evening)! AirDog Team Dear Founders, It’s On! We’ve shipped AirDog to backers in Batch #1, so those in Batch #1 will be getting shipping confirmation within a couple of days (as Easter weekend approaches our shipping partners may send your confirmation next week). Get ready! We’re stoked about shipping and looking forward to everyone getting their AirDog. Meanwhile our development team continues to implement the solution to the GPS interference from some GoPro camera models. The design of the new GPS board is almost completed and the components for manufacturing are waiting in the factory for the green light from our engineers. All of our resources are focused on getting Batch #2 out asap. Testing with the Pros If you follow us on Instagram then for sure you’ve seen that we’ve been busy getting feedback and pushing AirDog to its limits with some of the best in Snowboarding, MTB, Water Skiing and Wakeboarding. Testing with the likes of JP Solberg (Yes. Snowboards), Danny Harf (Ronix), Shawn Watson , Aaron Chase (Red Bull), Nicholi Rogatkin (Specialized MTB) and more amazing athletes ensures that AirDog exceeds the challenge for those even at the top of their sport. Advancing Coaching Mike Ferraro needs no introduction for those familiar with water sports, here he talks about AirDog and the future of coaching as Dom Hernler (Red Bull, Ronix), named Union’s Rider of the Year (2015) shreds with AirDog. We’re digging getting to know the Ronix team and it’s great seeing their passion for improving athlete performance, something AirDog will help take to the next level. <url>’re ready to start shipping and will ship Batch #1 of AirDogs next week. Although, AirDogs in Batch #1 will only be compatible with GoPro Hero 4 Black. We will ship out AirDogs that are compatible with GoPro models Hero 3, Hero 3+ &amp; Hero 4 Silver/Black in Batch #2, which is scheduled for the third week of April. What this means: KS Backers that are in Batch #1 can choose to receive their AirDog now or wait to be included in Batch #2 (if you’re in batch #1 you’ll be contacted soon). The issue: We found out that the GoPro causes interference with the GPS signal while it is recording, heavily affecting GPS quality, so we are relocating the GPS module and antenna. Some GoPro models and firmware combinations work better than others, but we are confident only in GoPro 4 Black with the current GPS positioning. Moving Forward We realize that for some Backers this causes a delay, but for those within Batch #1 with GoPro 4 Black nothing changes. And as we’re creating tech that hasn’t existed before, you as early adopters of are a huge part of it, to which we’re very grateful for. Snowpark Session Always searching for ways to improve, we recently headed to a local snowpark to test out various flight modes. Here’s the result! <url>’ve got a short, but good update. Let's go. Smart Batteries &amp; Shipping Update Everything is on schedule. The smart battery production is moving along as planned. Electronics are being manufactured already and the factory is setting up testing jigs and stands to verify every single battery’s quality after final assembly. We’re counting down the days until we send out the biggest batch of AirDogs yet. Again, thanks for your patience during this delay! Damper Issue, Resolved While the last shipping delay was caused by batteries we used the time and situation to fix several other issues. As we’ve told you before, we were searching for new materials for the new dampers that would perform efficiently (isolate vibrations from the camera) in temperatures below 26ºF (-3ºC). We’ve managed to source the new dampers and they will be on all AirDogs that are going out in the next shipment. All of the Beta Testers will receive new gimbal parts with a replacement video tutorial and will be able to fix this issue on their own. Hurray! No more shaky footage in winter conditions. Arm Bridge Abrasion After a lot of feedback from our Beta Testers, it became apparent that after some time it became harder and harder to unfold and fold AirDog’s arms due to abrasion caused by the “arm bridge” (a plastic part that holds the arms to the main body) . So along with replacing the dampers we’ve also replaced the arm bridges with new ones made from a different material. This will keep folding and unfolding AirDog smooth and seamless even after 1000 cycles. Snowboarding Following us on Instagram ? If not, check this out. . Thanks for reading and have a great day! AirDog Team Dear Founders, The week is coming to an end and we’ve got a quick update for you. Smart Battery Progress Two weeks ago we announced that we postponed shipping and were to resume shipping around the second week of March. Since then we’ve developed several iterations of prototypes and arrived at a solution that met our requirements. As of last week the smart battery pre-production electronic version arrived and is being tested and everything works as expected. The factory is working on setting up assembly tooling and all is going according to plan. Thanks for your patience, we’re getting closer and closer and as a result of the shipping delay a larger batch of AirDogs will be shipped out when we resume shipments. AirDog set up w/ DC Rainmaker Our backer and Beta tester Ray Maker, aka DC Rainmaker posted quick setup video. We’re totally diggin’ his creativity and how Ray is planning out the shots he’s going for with AirDog. <url>’re not developing dedicated flight modes for (yet). Here’s the result of taking AirDog paragliding. <url>’ve resolved. Check out our blog post and Tobi's impressions of AirDog here . Have a great end to the week! AirDog Team Dear Founders, We hope you are enjoying your week. We’ve got some information that affects shipping, and some updates on fun adventures we’ve been on, so please read ahead... Battery Safety Recently there was an isolated case of an AirDog battery catching fire during charging, the incident took place in Thailand, while one of our Beta Testers was there for a visit. This is the first and only incident we have ever had since we’ve began working with our batteries and chargers. While lithium polymer battery fires are very rare they can happen suddenly and can do a lot of damage. Customer safety is Airdog's top priority, and after analysis of this case we have voluntarily decided to replace the current lithium polymer batteries with new, redesigned smart lithium polymer batteries. The battery cell itself stays the same but the electronics in the battery pack are being upgraded. To mitigate the risk of any battery-caused fire or damage, we will not include the current battery in any of the outgoing shipments and will hold shipments until we have the new battery in-hand. We have already been working on AirDog Battery 2.0 (to improve efficiency) for a few months and have sped-up the production schedule to the earliest possible completion date of the second week of March. It pains us to delay shipping, but your safety is key. Those who have AirDog: We advise you to not charge the current batteries. Although if you decide to do so, use extra caution when charging the battery (never leave the battery unattended or overnight and charge on concrete or other non-flammable surfaces). As a reminder, we will post the battery usage guidelines from the user manual at the end of this update. Those who will have AirDog: We have the AirDog units ready to ship, but we will only proceed with shipping when the new batteries are available. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience, but your safety is very important to us. The safety functions of the new batteries are covered at the end of this post. And more positive news… Orlando Videos We have loads of killer footage from our trip in the US last month, so we’ll continue to roll out the videos in the coming weeks. Today we’re droppin’ a video we shot with Pro Slalom Waterskier Dorien Llewellyn. <url>’s footage. We gave Kynan a call to thank him for all the beta testing input and great video. Kynan also answered some questions and covered his first impressions with AirDog in this post . <url>’s his first video with AirDog, we’re super impressed with the creativity and angles Ray used already in the first day of riding. <url>"storage" level (65%), which will greatly reduce the risk of battery damage. 6. Existing chargers will be compatible with new batteries, but eventually we will be shipping new chargers with AirDog kits. Those will be laptop style chargers that will be more suitable for the new batteries. We will not replace existing chargers, though new chargers will be available as an upgrade option. Dear Founders, Here’s this week’s update. Shipping Last week we shipped the 1st batch of AirDogs (to backers) and this week we’re preparing orders for the 2nd batch (to backers), which will ship early next week. Your support has been great and we’re itching to get all AirDogs out to ya! Please take notice, some backers still need to confirm their shipping address and phone number in order to receive their AirDog. Shipping for our pre-order customers will commence after shipping to backers is complete. Sub zero temperature issue In order to have smooth and vibration free video we’ve installed dampers (vibration absorbers) on the gimbal system, as per usual. The specs from our current manufacturer of dampers were to work until -40ºF (-40ºC) temperatures. During the whole prototyping period we were testing only in warm climates but now when the winter kicked in we learned through both our experience and beta tester’s that in 26ºF (-3ºC) and lower temperatures the dampers change their physical structure and become hard, which leads to less than optimal footage quality. The solution to this will take a few months to source and test other materials, but won’t delay shipping, and we’ll go with current dampers. So once we’ve got the new dampers ready we’ll send the replacements along with a video guide so you can replace them without shipping back your AirDog. The replacement will be a rather simple mechanical procedure that can be done by an unskilled person in 15-30 minutes. But in case you would like to wait and have the new dampers installed on your AirDog please reach out by e-mail to <email> simply saying that you are willing to wait for the new dampers. An upside to this is that you’re not affected if you’re flying in temperatures warmer than 26ºF (-3ºC). Backer Video “The first time I flew my Airdog above water! It was great!!! The wind was around 15-18 knots and the video is super stable.” - Yair from Israel had this to say after his first time with AirDog out on the water. Check out the action! <url>’ll also publish longer edits and reviews soon. ISPO 2016 We’re having a great time at ISPO 2016 in Munich. If you’re around you’ve got to drop by, there’s only 2 more days left! Thanks and have a great week! Airdog Team Dear Founders, Here's this week's update and some fresh videos. Update on Beta testing process So far there's really valuable input coming from our Beta testers community. We're going through the feedback provided by our testers and we're constantly implementing software updates that will further enhance AirDog user experience to make sure you all receive a really fantastic product. Shipping Several hundred of AirDogs are produced and waiting to be shipped. Production lines are busy and we are preparing shipping documentation for the first batch. We will start with smaller batches and increase their size week by week. From what we've learned with our current shipments to our Beta testers, it takes a lot of our support team's time and effort to deal with all Q&amp;A for each delivery. Nevertheless we learn quickly, so with every batch we will provide a smoother user experience. By the end of February all AirDogs will be shipped to our Kickstarter community. We're still missing quite a lot of your phone numbers! Please submit your phone number ASAP (info on how to do that was published in the previous Kickstarter update). We're also sending email reminders to all of those who haven't provided this information. The shipping company is scheduled to pick up AirDogs next Wednesday Jan 20th, so please send this information! Check out this little video with our beta tester Leon cruising on his longboard: <url>’re super stoked to attend ISPO (the biggest action sports event in Europe) in Munich. If you’re there we’d love to have a chat, so drop by our booth (B5/415)! Cheers! Hey Founders! Here's this week's update. CES 2016 Part of our team is out in Vegas for CES. Here’s a look at one of the videos taken during the media day. From Digital Trends: "AirDog is probably the easiest to fly drone ever made.". <url>’ll ship in backer order. But before we can ship, we’re asking that all backers check their phone number and address submissions on our website. Some provided this info, others didn’t. See the step by step guide at the bottom of this update if needed. Beta Testing From Texas to New Zealand our Beta Testers are flying AirDog in an array of environments and with almost every sport. Input has been super valuable and we’re working on software updates in order to have your AirDog in top form once you receive it. Backer Videos Kynan Stevenson from Texas, shared his first AirDog footage with us. We added music to the video, but that’s it. Kynan didn’t use any image stabilization - it’s just him on the coast kiteboarding! Kynan did add that winds were pretty low that day. <url>ºF (-20ºC) (remember, AirDog's minimum operating temperature is 14ºF (-10ºC), so -4ºF is a bit extreme), even despite the dampers being frozen (which resulted in some jello effect in the video). We're exploring different materials for the damper system in order to cope with extreme temperatures. <url>’ve got a really quick updated this go around. Scheduled As Planned We’re still on schedule to ship AirDog to all backers throughout January. You’ll get a notification before we ship, so be on the lookout. Shipment is based on backer order. Thanks for your patience and support. We couldn’t be more excited about all of you receiving AirDog. Happy New Year! There’s only a few more days left for 2015, we’re looking forward to the New Year and hope you are too! January is sure to bring extra adventures and excitement when you get AirDog! And if you're wondering what Santa does after Christmas, this might give you a good idea. <url>’re shipping and we have an AirDog Holiday Offer. Read on! Shipping Resumes It’s happening! After finding new ESC manufacturers, implementing and testing the new ESCs, and of course FCC and IC approval, we start shipping today! So those who volunteered to beta test, get ready! And everyone else, you’ll be getting AirDog as we’ve said before, in January 2016. Thanks for your patience and support during this time! Holiday Offer Until December 31st Since you’ve already ordered AirDog, when you purchase the (Holiday Offer) set of 3 batteries you receive an additional battery for free, that’s up to 72 minutes of flying! If you’ve got a friend that hasn’t bought AirDog or looking for a gift this Holiday Season, let them know that (until the Dec. 31st) they get a free battery when they purchase AirDog , that’s double the flight time! We’re Hiring! We’re looking for highly talented engineers ( and more ), so if you or someone you know want to join the fun of building a high tech future, get in touch with us. Yours, AirDog Team Dear Founders, Time for your weekly update. ESC and Shipping As we told you last week, the new batch of ESCs have arrived. Production and the final flight tests have met expectations, so AirDogs will be packaged on Monday (14th) and shipping will resume this upcoming Tuesday. And with IC &amp; FCC approval that means we will also ship to beta testers in Canada and the US. We’re pumped! User Video We’re super thrilled with the videos you guys keep sending us. There’s not much that makes us more grateful than getting to see AirDog fly with backers. So, check out this video from Markus snowboarding with friends. And if you can, share the videos! <url>’s update regarding FCC and IC certification and updates on the ESC process. ESC Last week we told you we’d be getting the new ESCs this week. Well, our new manufacturer has notified us there will be a one week delay, this is unfortunate and it’s out of our hands. Although, while we wait we’re doing all we can to make sure there’s no delays on our side. FCC &amp; IC Approval Finally! AirDog and AirLeash both have FCC and IC certification. This means that we will be shipping to our beta testers in North America. While waiting for approval was a normal part of the process, its taken too long for our liking and we’re super relieved to have certification. If you’re one of the backers that volunteered to beta test AirDog, be on the lookout for notification concerning shipment. Backer Videos If you’ve been visiting our blog , you will have seen our 3 latest posts have featured backers that are beta testing AirDog. Head over to see our latest backer’s video and a short Q &amp; A session. What Else is Going On? Quite a bit. As beta testers send us logs, we tweak and tinker. Here’s a look: We’re developing a completely new mode for skiing. More info will come later on. We’re also working on a specific flight mode for snow parks. You’ll need this when you hit huge kickers. Another big thing is the new AirLoader version which will automatically download logs from your ADs and ALs and will upload to our cloud system. It will merge with the ticketing system so that our support team can handle large numbers of requests when we ship larger amount of products out. This will improve your experience and service level and boost efficiency. Thanks We can’t thank you all enough for everything, your ongoing support is vital to Airdog’s progress. We're truly grateful for this community! P.S. We hope our American friends had a wonderful Thanksgiving! Hello Founders, We hope you're having a great week. As usual, we’ve got some updates for you. ESC Our new ESC manufacturer will ship the new ESCs this upcoming Tuesday (the 24th). Which means they should clear customs and arrive in the factory by the 1st of December. After being shipped to the factory, assembly will take place. The ESC wiring will be soldered, covered with lacquer and from there we’ll put AirDog through the final and necessary testing. Once that’s finished, it looks like shipping will resume on the 7th of December. They say patience is a virtue, so another hearty thanks goes out to our virtuous backers. FCC Agris just got off the phone with the office in California and was told that the AirLeash application has been reviewed and they expect that the certificate will be granted today. So with fingers crossed, we’ll have more good news next week. Skiing Footage Some have been asking for some skiing footage and since we don’t have snow (yet) we asked our friends in Switzerland to give it a go with AirDog. <url>’ll resume shipping, it will be sometime early December. So thanks for bearing with us, there’s a lot of light at the end of the ESC tunnel. The last thing to let you know is that we’ve decided to go with a new ESC manufacturer. When the time is right we will release more info about the new ESCs, but rest assured we’re very excited about this step in the venture. FCC &amp; IC As we’ve said in the past, we have passed all the tests for both FCC and IC certification for AirDog and AirLeash. The reports for AirDog &amp; AirLeash and have also been cleared. And as of yesterday the lab conducting these tests told us that the application for AirLeash should be reviewed early next week (AirDog is good to go and doesn’t require the application that AirLeash does). So we should have an update again for you next week regarding approval, we’re sharing info as we get it. Beta Tester's Video In case you missed it, here’s a short overview from Janis, one of our supporter's (customer and beta tester) video and experience with his AirDog. Janis shot and edited this video without any help from us (aside from a song change, so we could publish the video). Being able to start sharing our customer’s videos is getting us stoked! And we have more lined up to share with you. <url>’d like to thank all of you for your ongoing support and patience during this process. Now, we’ve got some updates for you concerning the ESC and FCC, small steps towards progress. ESC Since our last update on ESC issues we’ve been hard at work solving the issue to deliver you a great performing AirDog. We have been working a lot with the current ESC provider as well as with different manufacturers to potentially supply a completely new ESC. We’ve got three options on the table: 1. Get 100% assurance that we can continue with the current ESC provider after extremely rigorous testing process is implemented (which includes filtering out the faulty ECSs, software updates plus many other steps). We’ve been flying with these ESCs for over a year with great performance and it’s only with the latest batch that these failures have happened. If this proves successful (after solid performance that leaves no room for doubt), we can re-start shipping early December. 2. Select an alternative ESC manufacturer that we trust, that would develop custom ESCs for AirDog. We tried the best off-the-shelf solutions and learned that we need custom modification for AirDog. If we select this scenario, we would receive first batch of new ESCs fitting AirDog late December. 3. From the alternative ESC manufacturer list there is one ESC off-the-shelf unit that might fit AirDog. We will be testing this scenario throughout weekend and early next week. If this works we can re-start shipping AirDog with new ESCs early December. We want to prove that Option 1 is possible (once again - we have had a year of great performance with current ESCs) so we will not stop until we do so! Options 2 and 3 are our alternative backup scenarios if the upcoming current manufacturer tests are not successful. For our beta testers that are aware of the ESC risks and are willing to continue testing, tests are resuming. We can’t thank all of you enough for helping us with the testing. FCC Another pain point for us is the FCC. We are working with an agency which does all the testing and submits all the paperwork on our behalf (normal industry practice) and despite having passed all tests we still have no confirmation from the agency and the FCC. We’re almost constantly contacting them and the replies we continually receive state that it will be 1 or 2 weeks until we get approval. This final step is taking a much longer time than anticipated. Closing Thoughts We’re staying positive and most of you have been rock stars in your support. We couldn’t ask for a better community to be a part of and we can reassure you we’re working as hard as we can to deliver the best auto-follow drone for adventure sports ever! Enjoy your weekend and we’ll send updates as soon as we have them. Sincerely Yours, Airdog Team Hello Founders, First of all thanks for the support, understanding and positive attitude from your side. This encourages us to be more open with you even at times when things aren't going so well. ESC Update We’ve identified the cause of the ESC failure that we told you about last week. We have some software tweaks coming out that can reduce the possibility of ESC failure but we will need to change the ESC component. The quality of the current manufacturer’s production turned out to be inconsistent and this is not something we want to risk. We will receive the alternative ESCs tomorrow and will conduct testing as soon as they’re at our lab. If these tests prove successful then we’ll move forward with the new manufacturer and implement the changes (which may include customization of ESC form factor) if needed. Negotiations about manufacturing, changes in design and lead times are being done in parallel with testing. The hardware part of all this is what will take up most of the time. By the end of next week we’ll know the exact timing, but as of now it looks like this process will go slightly past 30 days we initially estimated. Also, our Beta Testers will resume testing tomorrow, so we’re expecting additional user experience input and feedback. Just to add, the feedback we've received thus far has been a big help. Winter Is Coming Ready for snow and hot cocoa? We are. Part of our team is currently on their way back from the Austrian Alps where they were rigorously testing AirDog’s flight modes for snowboarding and skiing. So for you guys and gals that’ll be hittin’ the backcountry when you get AirDog, the flight modes will be on par and ready for you. Thanks for everything, Airdog Team Dear Founders, Here's this week's update. FCC Tests completed! Late last week we received great news. AirDog has passed all tests pertaining to FCC and IC certification and now comes the paperwork as the last step to attain certification. This means we're one step closer to shipping AirDog to our U.S. and Canadian based beta testers. AirDog flies for local media Last week we presented AirDog to the local media, going over details as well as current and future plans. The event was great and our friend Dmitrij Zeigliš came out for a wake session for an AirDog demo. Watch a little bit of Dmitrij's wake session on our latest blog post . Beta Testing The feedback we’ve received from our beta testers has lead to some improvements to AirDog’s firmware. These issues haven’t show up during our testing, so we’re glad to have started this testing phase and thankful to those that have volunteered to be the early adopters. We will continue to ship out more AirDogs this week and next week to additional beta testers. We hope that the tests continue to go well and if there aren't any major setbacks (that come out of the blue) we're still planning to ship AirDogs to all backers by the end of November. AirDog Community We’ll continue to update you here on Kickstarter and through our newsletters, though we encourage all of you to frequently visit AirDog’s forum and blog for stories and updates as AirDog takes us to new places. Always Yours, Airdog Team Dear Founders, We're glad to share our latest update with you. Your Phone Number We’ve received many questions asking how to provide your phone number in order to receive your AirDog. So at the bottom of this update is a step by step guide to help those that need help. "You Do Not Want to Miss Out On This." That’s what our first beta tester Kristjan said after his first AirDog flight. Pumped about it he had a more to say. Visit our blog to see his first impressions. FCC Certification Progress We’re happy to say some progress is being made, 2 of the main tests are completed and have passed and the final test is scheduled this week. After the 3rd test is passed and we receive full FCC certification, we will begin shipping to our beta testers based in the US of A. Good things come to those who wait. Tell Your Friends If you’ve already pre-ordered AirDog for yourself, then most likely those that are close to you know about it. And after you get yours, they’ll definitely want one for themselves, so tell your friends that the special offer ends on October 15th.

Extra AirLeash Update For those that have asked about extra AirLeashes or have pre-ordered them during the Kickstarter campaign: For backers, additional AirLeashes will be shipped December Ordering an extra AirLeash for other customers will be available mid-October Full functionality of 2 AirLeashes per AirDog will be completed by December (AirDog software update required) Kickstarter campaign delivery carried out by our US enterprise Please remember that the AirDog Kickstarter campaign was run by our US enterprise. It’s just like any other online order from the US. This means: US customers will not pay an international import duty nor sales tax. EU customers will pay VAT upon delivery, but no import duty applies. International import duties and VAT may apply depending on local country regulations. Video from the Swiss Alps Some of our crew made it out to the Swiss Alps for altitude auto-follow testing and it was a good thing we went, a couple of issues popped up that weren't apparent in flat terrain tests. The tweaks have been made and were easy to fix. This was our first time testing AirDog at such rapid altitude changes, so we were pumped about its performance. Our guys aren’t pros at MTB, so AirDog is the focus here ;) Watch the uncut video from one of the test rides - <url>’s get to it! More altitude tests Since around our R&amp;D lab there are no mountains (highest mountain is only 311m), our team went to Alps, to do real life altitude tests and enhance AirDog performance in mountains. So AirDog has landed in Alps. Tests are going really well, here's a short video of the first day in Alpine slopes: <url>’re super close to shipping out the first AirDog units. The first units will be boxed and ready to go shortly to beta testers living outside the U.S.. Also, we hope that FCC certification is completed soon. We’ll make sure to let you know once it’s approved and then we’ll ship to U.S. beta testers. We also want to make sure that first AirDogs that are shipped have been upgraded with latest enhanced software, that has been properly tested in all kinds of terrains and environments. We have units ready and we want to take each and every AirDog for a spin before we ship, to make sure everything is working great. The World’s first full-auto wake session At last, we want to share with you some sick shots we got while testing AirDog’s LINE mode with Breddas in their homeland of Sweden. This was actually the World’s first fully autonomous wakeboarding film, no one operated the cable or the cameras, whether on the ground or in the air, Mattias set up the GoPros, started AirDog from AirLeash and went for it. So enjoy! <url>’ve had! We’ve been busy putting AirDog through the tests and spending time with one of our Kickstarter backers right here in Riga. You can read more about it below but first, we’ve got some exciting updates: • Shipping Plan • Production Update and FCC Certification • AirDog Smartphone App • Warranty • Battery and Parts Ordering • Kickstarter Backer Kevin Hancox’s Visit &amp; First Impressions (video) • Introducing: AirDog Founders Club Shipping Plan We aim to start shipping September 14. Providing we have the necessary approvals and certifications in place we will start shipping the first batch to our US backers. We aim to deliver AirDog to all US backers by the end of October and shipments to all other International Backers should be complete before the end of the year. Production Update &amp; FCC Certification Production: We’ve fixed the arm vibration issue and have the prototype drones flying seamlessly. We aim to complete production of the first units shortly. FCC Certification: We have submitted the final product samples to the FCC and now are awaiting for the certification process to complete. AirDog Smartphone App We have submitted the launch version of the app for approval. We aim to have both the iOS and Android versions available on the first day of shipping. The app has to be linked with AirDog for activation. Warranty Our warranty policy will be as follows: • AirDog Drone, AirLeash: 1 year • Battery, Propeller Motors, Gimbal Motors, Battery Charger: 6 months • Plastic Parts: No warranty Ordering AirDog Parts &amp; Batteries Batteries and other important AirDog parts will be available for purchase on AirDog.com mid-September. Third-party batteries will not be compatible with AirDog. Our warranty will not cover the damages resulting from the use of the drone with a battery which is not provided by AirDog. Kickstarter Backer Kevin Hancox Visit &amp; First Impressions We were super stoked to spend time with one of our most active Kickstarter backer community members, Kevin Hancox, who came to Riga to test out Airdog with us and have endless hours of discussions answering many of his and other backer’s questions. You can check out the video of his visit below: <url>’s blog posts about his visit here and here , on Instagram and a Q&amp;A on AirDog Facebook Group. AirDog Founders Club Many of you have asked us about special backer bonus, and now we’re excited to announce a program we think you definitely deserve! What is the Program? Watch the video below: <url>’t share this with you earlier but in late June when we received the first batch of factory manufactured arms assembled with motors, speed controllers and props we came across a very unexpected issue. During the test flight with these new arms AirDog started vibrating and shaking badly, it actually couldn’t even maintain its position. It turned out that Mr. Murphy had been watching us and made sure that injection moulded polycarbonate arms (remember that all prototypes up to now were 3D printed) had the same resonance frequency that is being generated by motors. This issue did not show up in computer simulations before. Our mechanics engineers had to dive deep into arms design again and find the way how to solve this problem. We went through many different options and found a solution that did not require changing moulds, we found a different plastic material that has different physical characteristics (it is more stiff in simple words). All unwanted vibrations were finally gone for good. Long story short, this was the main reason why this update comes out a bit later than promised, we have received new arm samples just a few days ago and can confirm that this issue is solved and we have now ordered a larger quantity of arms for assembly. This issue alone took another month in our production schedule and despite that we might be late just a few days or a week in worst case. These are good news since if we had to change the mould it would lead to a massive delay. Meanwhile all of the electronics have been fully manufactured already and being tested, programmed and waiting for final assembly as soon as plastic parts arrive later this week. Certification Due to the last minute changes in electronics until mid July and recent vibration issues we are on a very tight schedule here as well but still hoping to receive FCC certification in time (this affects only US backers). We are currently undergoing final procedures for this certification. New flight modes To continue with some really great news we want to share videos of two completely new flight modes that have been in development for a while and are stable enough to show you a quick preview, more details on these flight modes will be revealed soon. Actually we hope to include them in the first release already. These are by far the most dynamic and cinematographic modes we have developed. Check out videos from test flights in our test field: <url>’s been a busy month! Over the past few weeks our software engineers have been working on bluetooth connection improvements and we have switched our software to use EMMC memory chips instead of SD cards for onboard data storage. The work on mobile apps continues and we’re also developing cloud database for individual AirDog configuration preset storage. UX for AirLeash is being finalized. We're working on factory calibration &amp; test process coordination both for hardware and software to ensure flawless drone configuration. But let's cut to the chase, we're super stoked to tell you that - Production of AirDogs has launched! Yes, it is happening and it's happening a few weeks earlier than we previously announced with our production schedule. Check this sweet video below: Our manufacturing contractor HansaMatrix has recently built a new production plant which will accommodate AirDog production lines. We hope you are as happy as we are now! The next steps for us are - continue production of different Airdog parts, move one with assembly of complete final products, do the product calibration and tests in factory. Over the next few weeks we will be working on packaging design, continue work on software, do the test flights of AirDog production units, etc. - we will keep you posted. Regarding color options - we have decided to stick with our bright purple and yellow color scheme. We want to make sure that your bright colored AirDog is visible in all environments you will encounter during your outdoor activities. Furthermore, these colors will go hand in hand with other stuff like - logo, packaging, different accessories, spare parts, and we will not be changing those to match different color schemes. We value your support and understanding on this decision. Stay tuned to our updates as we’ll be posting more details on production progress and shipping. As always, we want to thank you for being great supporters. You rock! Sincerely, AirDog Team Hello! We want to thank you again for backing AirDog. We are excited that so many people share our vision and have joined us on our mission to empower storytelling around your adventures in action sports. You have been waiting patiently for your AirDog and we wanted to give you our latest update on our progress. This one marks a significant pinnacle in AirDog’s development. A number of things are happening, including a series of small but important updates that need to happen before we start production, but most importantly we are extremely pleased to share with you the shipping date for the first batch of units. Production Making a prototype compared to actually getting the product manufactured is a piece of cake. Knowing that doesn’t help too much and completing one prototype really instils just how much time and energy this can take. We have finally come to a moment when we have stopped almost all R&amp;D for the version 1.0. Final designs, schematics and BOMs have been passed to the contract manufacturer and the majority of components have been ordered and some of them have already been delivered to the factory. We would be lying if we said that there are absolutely no challenges left but we will come to those momentarily. The most important thing we would like to share with you is the production schedule: Up to July 5th we (and our subcontractor engineers) are finalizing all testing equipment and software for manufacturing process July 5th - starts the manufacturing of AirDog arms and batteries. July 15th - starts manufacturing of complete AirDog August 5th - we receive a very small test batch August 15th - if we don’t find any major issues in the test batch we continue with a larger batch August 31st- we start shipping of the first batch Further down the line manufacturing will become a continuous process and we will be shipping as soon as new AirDogs come into our logistics warehouse. Final challenges Lidar This turned out to be the hardest sensor integration for us. Both us and the lidar developer are start-ups so there have been issues on both sides, but we have been solving them one by one. We have little time left to finalize this but we are working tirelessly to get everything completed according to the timescales above. Bluetooth We are working to improve the robustness of the connection between the AirDog and AirLeash. In particular, how to reconnect after a lost signal. This is a software and configuration calibration so it doesn’t have impact on production. AirDog got its tail! Those of you who have been building drones as hobbyists know that there is one extremely sensitive sensor to the EMI and it is magnetometer or compass. We added a small “tail” to the main body lower part to accommodate mag. After scientific measurements and tests we found this location to be the least affected by EMI even at full throttle. This change improved AirDog’s flight precision at higher speeds. Great news on camera charging We have received great results with camera charging from drone battery. We haven’t finished extensive testing, but we are currently able to power both GP 3 and GP 4 cameras when attached to the gimbal. So you will be able to forget about the hassle to remember about camera battery charging when using AirDog and which is an awesome feature as you can lose so many great moments because of your camera battery dying during flight. Funding We have successfully raised an additional $500k. Taking us to $2.5m raised. We decided that the additional funds would come in handy given the longer production timescale. The vast majority of that additional funding infusion came from an AngelList syndicate lead, friend and investor Dan Bragiel. With the amount raised we feel confident about the future and our ability to build a sustainable business. We truly value you and your support. AirDog would not have been able to get this far without you. Thank you! Dear backers, As usual it’s just about the time when some of you start getting really impatient for an update on our progress :) This time besides lots of small tech stuff we also have great news on the business side that also have direct impact to all of you as well. We have talked before about how important it is for us to build a sustainable business that goes far beyond the amazing Kickstarter campaign you guys are all part of. Just recently we raised 2M USD of equity funding to support AirDog’s strive to become the go-to drone for capturing content in action sports. It was crucial for us as a team and we believe that also of great value for the ones who have helped us to get this far. The money raised will help to build a better product and company. The round of funding was led by Seraph Group and joined by IT-Farm Corporation, Base Ventures, FlyCap, Imprimatur Capital and by a group of savvy angel investors like Konstantin Othmer, Harry Cheung, Vinny Lingham, Chris Hulls and Arthur Watson. Now with the tech stuff. LIDAR integration LIDAR integration is challenging. Besides the issues we mentioned in the previous update all the samples we had from manufacturer had pretty bad EMI (electromagnetic interference) that affected other electronics such as GPS. Additionally we had to rewrite and optimize drivers. These issues have been worked out and currently LIDAR is undergoing final test phase and seems to works very well. Power distribution and EMI During our extensive testing we had noticed weird AirDog behavior at certain situations especially when it was flying at 70% throttle or more. It had a strange yawing movement. After countless hours of examination we discovered that we are having a spike of EMI at higher power outputs and it was messing up the magnetometer. Until now all power distribution was done on a 2 layer PCBs where main power tracks where parallel to each other and were creating a strong EM field. So to reduce this issue we redesigned these PCBs to 6 layer setup where we can reduce to EMF to minimum. This week we are receiving these new boards and we hope to close this issue after tests. Sensor temperature stabilization As we explained in the previous update we have designed and developed a separate sensor board with built in heating components that stabilize sensor temperature to avoid sensor drift. Since then we have undergone numerous tests and studies. We actually measured that if turned on at room temperature and then brought outside to -10 C (14 F) sensors drifted about 8 to 12 degrees. From the previous update comments we feel that we need to explain what is the sensor drift that we are trying to fix here. So the drift happens when sensors are calibrated at a certain temperature, let's say at room temperature in a factory or by user at home and then user turn on the drone in sub zero temperatures. In such situations sensors are showing wrong orientation of the drone. This is less noticeable in manually controlled drones, but is very crucial for AirDog which is fully autonomous and which has to precisely follow a subject. To solve this we plan to heat up sensors up to a certain fixed temperature at which they will be calibrated and maintain it regardless of the ambient temperature during flight. We also proved that no two sensors are the same and every sensor has its own drift curve. We are expecting a second version of the sensor PCB this week and are finalizing the software that controls temperature stabilization process meanwhile. All we can say this far is that we are very happy we went this path and it looks to be a great solution. Camera charging and control We had a small hope that GoPro might be friendly and allow us to access camera control (Record/Stop) through power connector and this way control the camera, but in the meantime we have implemented a workaround with a dummy battery. This method has been tested and included in the new electronics design. Motors &amp; Props Motor bell design has been refined to integrate a propeller shaft - the motor is a few grams lighter now and that is great since every gram is crucial for anything that flies. We are working with our propeller manufacturer to refine the shape and airfoil as we want to squeeze some more efficiency out of the already very good props. The final design should be ready in 3 weeks. Manufacturer has promised to deliver already balanced props so that neither us nor you should ever have to worry about balancing. Speed controllers (ESC's) Electronic speed controller PCB has been reworked to ensure better heat dissipation. We have just received final samples and will test them hard during the next few weeks, but added heatsink and PCB redesign should solve rare overheating issues. Additional batteries and shipping For Kickstarter backers we will be able to include up to 2 additional batteries (3 in total) in same shipping box at no extra shipping cost. We will ask you to place additional battery orders just before shipping your AirDog. Starting from 4th battery additional shipping charges will apply. Same applies to AirLeashes. We will put 2 AirLeashes into the original box for everyone who has ordered Master Kit or Standard Kit + additional AirLeash separately later. Maximum 2 AirLeashes can fit in the carry case. Manufacturing schedule We are pushing hard to commence manufacturing of AirDogs by the end of May and have the first batch out soon after. Components with the longest delivery time are already ordered (motors, batteries, propellers). We are still uncomfortable with announcing the exact shipping date for first batch since we might and most probably will come across issues we are yet not aware of. We learn fast and most often we learn from others, however we know that there will always be lessons we will learnt the hard way. So if you can read between the lines what we are saying actually is that we are done with mechanics, electronics are undergoing last iterations, new feature development in software is being frozen by 30th of April, critical components have been ordered already, tooling for manufacturing ordered, BOMs finalized. This all means we are closer than ever to making yours and ours dream real. Keep up the good faith and thank you for your immense support! Dear backers, we would like to share our latest updates with you. The closer we get to the production process the more technical our updates become, making them less exciting for the average AirDog user. But the devil is in the details. So here is our current progress and the challenges we are dealing with since the last update. Sensor temperature stabilization Well… we have always said that AirDog is a no compromise piece of technology and here comes further proof of that. To those of you who are drone enthusiasts and have owned couple of them you might know that there is a well known issue with gyroscopes and accelerometers when temperature is changing. They start drifting and the drone may even crash immediately after takeoff. This typically is solved by manual recalibration of sensors every time you fly in different temperatures or the sensor drift may be mathematically corrected if the drift characteristics are known at different temperatures. The first solution is very user unfriendly since calibration takes time and is not very simple, so we really do not want to leave this into hands of our product users. Second option is great but has several disadvantages since actually every single sensor in every drone is a bit different and some sensors have very unilinear drift over the temperature range so mathematical correction is not 100% safe. And we want to stay safe even when the user turns on the drone indoors at room temperature and goes out to film some snowboarding at sub zero colds. So we looked at the military (since we all know the most advanced technologies are developed for them) grade systems and learned that the safest way to ensure very stable sensor reading is to stabilize the temperature of the sensors themselves. Literally this means that we are now heating sensors up to certain temperature that is significantly higher then the possible maximum ambient temperature and keeping it stable while the drone is turned on. Some of you might ask if this doesn’t require a long warm-up time. Actually no, we need around 40 seconds to heat sensors to required temperatures and that is about the same time required for the GPS to lock on new location anyway. We are undergoing tests of this new upgrade right now and it seems to be one of the best engineering decisions we have made in order to achieve unmatched hassle free user experience. Mould manufacturing Yes, the moulds manufacturing for all the plastic parts has started. We delivered the final 3D design files to the manufacturer some time ago and now all we can do is avoid any changes in design since this is very time consuming process and we wouldn’t be able to complete the product if even the smallest part wasn’t designed accurately. So while this in progress we are using the time to finalize electronics and improving software. Production tooling and test equipment For some time we have been working with our contract manufacturer engineers to develop different specific tools that will be needed during the manufacturing process. With that we mean both the software and specific equipment such as sensor calibration devices, some specific part gluing mechanisms, drone arm and motor test stands etc. Together with the manufacturer we are trying to come up with the most efficient and optimal final assembly workflow. As we said… nothing too exciting but all this has to be done to start production. Foldable props After numerous tests and several conceptual designs we have come to a conclusion that we will be using another method for prop removal when it is needed. Props will have a built-in metal thread that will fit only on the right arm to avoid human errors. The reason for this decision isn’t because we couldn’t come up with a good engineering solution, but financial. It turned out that if we wanted to manufacture a mechanism of foldable props that performs as well as regular prop it would be unreasonably expensive. It would require quite a few super precise part manufacturing, tricky balancing and there are 4 of them which quadruples the cost by more than 6x compared to standard props. And since you can fold AirDog with all the regular props anyway we thought that it wouldn’t be a deal-breaker. For very compact transportation you will need around 15 seconds to remove all 4 props. Later we might offer a foldable prop mechanism as an optional upgrade for those who will really feel they want it. We have added to the drone many components that we didn’t plan in the beginning such as Lidar so we hope you will support us un this decision. Lidar implementation Another technical challenge we came across was the Lidars we chose to use in the final product had some issues with i2C interface. Not going too deep in tech talk we are switching to a more robust PWM interface and next week we will be testing the reliability of that. Actually this is the main reason why we have been still holding back with beta test unit shipping. As soon as we will be able to get reliable functioning of Lidars we will ship out test units. Since we have reworked the software to need Lidar in many situations we do not want to step back here any more and at the moment this is not delaying manufacturing as well. Product packaging When we say packaging, we do not mean just a nice box. We are evaluating a possibility to include a really cool carrying and transportation case as a part of standard packaging. We thought that we could make a much more simple paper box and allocate the saved money for a case that would be a great way of transporting your AirDog along with 3 batteries, 2 AirLeashes, charger, cables and camera all at once. We hope we can make it in the budget and we are sure that most of you would appreciate to have piece of mind while transporting your AirDog on a plane or in your car trunk under all the sports gear and boards we all have, right? SXSW Accelerator AirDog is among 48 companies that will have the opportunity to present themselves at SXSW Accelerator . These 48 companies were selected by the SXSW Screening Committee from the hundreds of startups from across the United States and around the world who applied for SXSW Accelerator. 48 will be narrowed down to the top 18 companies – and these 18 startups will present to a new set of co-emcees and judges. At the end of the day, these judges will select the grand prize winners for each category. We are in Entertainment and Content Technologies category. The winners will go on to be honored at the SXSW Accelerator Awards. Fingers crossed! Guys we know, we really know it is unbearable to keep waiting and we also feel the same. We can’t wait for the day when thousands of your great and inspiring video stories about your adventures will start appearing on YouTube. That will be awesome. It takes what it takes and we are not resting until we get everything we have promised done and delivered. But we are getting very, very close. Thanks for the support and patience! <url>“come to you”, instead you will just click a button with corresponding title and the AirDog will immediately execute your command. Camera gimbal vibrations and horizon stabilisation While we have spent most of our time to develop superior follow algorithms we had left for the final stage some of the more basic drone stuff, such as vibrations isolation of camera gimbal and horizon stabilisation. You may have noticed in our videos that the horizon is not always perfect and there were some noticeable vibrations and jelly effect especially in the footage where drone was flying faster. Now it looks like we will have sorted out vibrations and our engineers are working on camera gimbal sensor integration with drone autopilot. The horizon drift was caused by the fact that our drone experiences rapidly changing accelerations during flight, and IMU sensors on gimbal were confused over time with these accelerations because it had no information from the drone if that acceleration is caused by a manoeuvre or it is gravity force vector. Now autopilot will be informing gimbal IMU to avoid these confusions and we should have super stable horizon forever. Another horizon drift reason was sensor calibration and temperature compensation that wasn't used until now. We are now experimenting with temperature compensated calibration process so that you don't experience problems regardless of the outside temperatures whether you are snowboarding in cold winter or surfing in hot Hawaii weather. So to start the production of AirDogs first of all we have to sort out anything related to mechanical design since those things wont be easy to change. We have 17 plastic parts plus 3 for AirLeash. 15 of those are 100% finished and we are ready for the moulds to be manufactured. We are wrapping up with the AirLeash and 2 remaining drone parts very shortly. We have undergone 4 iterations of electronics and feel like we are done with that so now the plastic parts are the final bottleneck at the moment but as you can see we are doing our best to finalise those ASAP. P.S. AirDog media coverage from CES 2015: <url>"AirDog just took it to the next level" <url>"Airdog looks like a company with a lot of momentum" <url>“Go To Initial Position” function - you will now be able to define the drones position and then by a press of the button make it take off, quickly approach you (when you are in the surf line-up for example), and set itself in a predefined shooting position. Usage of Sonar and Lidar is successfully implemented in our latest software. It perfectly holds the minimum ground distance above all kinds of surfaces - grass, sand, bushes, etc. Landing by rangefinder sensor has also been implemented - and it works even better than pilot guided landing! The “Return To Landing” tests have also been successful, with the code fully implemented. This now makes AirDog’s movements look very fluid, unlike robotic movements seen on other drones. Sensor calibration issue Changes in temperature may result in sensor reading drift. For example - if you calibrate your AirDog sensors in room temperature and go outside - they will not work as expected. We are currently investigating the idea of implementing a thermostat so that chip with sensors will maintain a constant temperature before and during the flight. Further testing will be required to solve the issue. As a minimum sefety measure we will implement preflight checks, so your AirDog will warn you when a recalibration of sensors is required. Beta Testers Ten beta testers have been chosen but have not yet been informed. We are awaiting for the beta drone batch, and as soon as they are ready to ship we will contact each of them individually and ship AirDogs right away. CES 2015 With your massive support our product is very close to launch and we will be presenting AirDog at Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, January 6-9. Our booth will be located in Central Plaza CP51, and secretly speaking - we will be conducting live demos there! That is going to be a blast, we're looking forward to it! Sony Action Cam Mini integration Good news for Sony action cam mini owners - we have developed gimbal for this camera and will soon conduct a demo flight. Stay tuned! P.S. Our latest videos: RED BULL SURF SCIENCE <url>’s because of these numerous test flights that we have encountered one issue that is vital we address before we ship the final product. This issue is ground collision avoidance. As you know there are different follow modes and some of them work perfectly no matter what the terrain, but when it comes to downhill and uneven surfaces - “Follow-me” with offset (example: AirDog repeats your trajectory at 5 meter distance on your five o'clock) it can hit any cliff, kicker or boulder that you are passing by. To illustrate the issue please see the visualisation below: <url>“battlefield” has flagged a technical challenge that we have to face before we can comfortably ship. Thankfully we already have a solution in place. We are currently implementing a sensor that will be scanning the surface under the AirDog and will command it to go higher if surface starts elevating. We have already initiated successful tests but because of the new components now required for the production process we are expecting delays. The changes in the process is as follows: We will need to postpone lower body casing mould production, which is where the sensor will physically be located and we need to finalize the implementation of the sensor into the software code. We want to provide our backers with full visibility but this also means we have to inform you that we will not be able to ship AirDog in November, and exact shipping dates cannot be confirmed until we have finalized engineering and the timeframe required from component suppliers. Hopefully we can do this in very short time. We have made this decision to invest into these improvements of AirDog as we know that you all want the ultimate action sports auto-follow drone that will be capable to keep up with you whatever you do and we are aiming to deliver that exact capability with the final version of AirDog. We hope to receive your support on this decision. WANTED: Beta Testers While we are sorting out improvements that we mention above we want to use this time and perform intensive testing together with some of you. We are handpicking 10 backers to send out test units. Selection criteria for beta testers: Knowledge of drone basics Soldering skills Firmware flashing Ability to test AirDog in action sports Willingness to test AirDog at least 30 minutes a day Knowledge of local drone laws We are looking forward to receiving your full feedback about AirDog’s performance, description of flights and any problems encountered, together with video material and autopilot log files. Testers also must speak English and be contactable on a regular basis. You can apply for Beta testers mailing us at <email>. Dear backers, First of all thank you for your great support , without you this campaign wouldn't be such a success. Since we've been receiving questions a lot this week we think we should clarify these 3 topics to everyone.. Payments Please make sure your payment went through successfully! We have emailed those who's payments did not go through so check your mailbox. Also either Kickstarter or Amazon should have emailed you to let you know whether or not there were any errors/problems, and if there were, you have time until this Saturday (August 2nd) to fix it on your side. After that, you'll be dropped from the backer list and won't get your reward. We know you want your reward, so be please make sure to check that everything is ok! Shipping address Don't worry about your shipping address yet! When you paid, Amazon asked for your billing address, but not your shipping address. We will be sending a survey email out asking for your shipping address, AirDog color, and other information before we are ready to ship,. Make sure you check your email for that, but don't panic if you don't see it immediately; it will be happening in October. Extra batteries Very soon you will be able to buy them on our online store www.airdog.com. We will include every one of you in our mailing list so you will be first to know when the batteries are available. We are still testing different brand batteries and haven't made our choice so cannot come up with final pricing yet. We want to make sure they will stand up for the task and will serve you for long time. Meanwhile you can read more about how we crafted our Kickstarter campaign here: <url>#techcrowd? <url>"no-fly zones" using our AirDog app. This will enable use of AirDog even in places where simple following wouldn't be possible or would be dangerous. AirDog community generated "no-fly zone" maps of your favorite wakeboarding cable parks, MX tracks, bike trails, snow-parks and ski resorts and other unimaginable places will be stored in a Cloud and available for download to all AirDog community members. So whenever you come to a place where someone has made a "no-fly zone" map - you simply download it, sync it with your AirDog and you are ready for a safe flight. There can't be too much safety when we are talking about drones. We are really excited to be able to implement this safety feature already in the first version of AirDog. And this is just the beginning. We have plenty of rad ideas and concepts on our roadmap and by becoming the owner of the AirDog you are putting a bet on the most advanced personal drone out there. Dear backers, Probably you have been keeping an eye on our kickstarter page as much as we did and you already know that today we have reached $ 1,000,000 ! We are pumped about where all this is going. We are changing the whole personal drone concept right now.
