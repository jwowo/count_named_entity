The blanks are done as alluded to in Brian's update. The laser on the other hand has been a nightmare. The laser was received after being back ordered and didn't work. The company I ordered the laser from sent a new PC board and they were sure it would fix the problem but it didn't. They sent a second PC board and it still didn't fix the problem. I had a tech look at the board before having them send a third and he was able to fix the board. Today I was finally able to connect the PC to the laser and and etch on some wood. So far so good. I will be posting some video of the laser on Sunday when I get back in town. With that said I would like to apologize. This project has been a much bigger challenge than originally anticipated. There have been a few of you that have expressed the desire to have the blanks shipped out to you rather than wait for the laser etching process. If any of you would like the blank dice I will ship them out ASAP. Please email me thru kick starter with your updated address and a phone number. For those of you waiting for the etching process, I am so sorry for the extended delay and ask for your forgiveness. I will be working on the dice and be mailing them out as sets and individual dice are completed. Had I known the delays and complexity associated with bringing these dice to reality I would not have even started the project. But I will get this project done and more importantly I will communicate with you. I have been waiting for this laser issue to be completed to have some good news, but I now know that even bad news is better than no information at all. Again I seek your forgiveness and patience as I get this project completed and update you consistently. The laser has finally arrived. I can't believe it had taken this long and appreciate your patience. This has been a very trying project and we have learned a lot. Working with titanium and stainless steel has proved to be quite a challenge and due to the hardness of those metals has taken nearly 10 times as long for tumbling than we expected. But that process on those metals is nearly complete. The other metals are ready for the laser numbering process right now. Brian will be building the trays for the dice used in the laser over the next few days. I will be sending out emails to everyone to confirm shipping addresses this week. I can't believe how many of our backers have contacted me with address changes in the last couple of months. Here is the laser we waited so long for: The dice are ready for the lasering on of the numbers. The laser is on back order but should be here next week. We will be shipping out the dice as soon as we get them lasered and sealed. We are so sorry for the delay and the lack of communication. I was hoping to have the laser this week. Here are some pics of the d10 dice. I will have Brian take more pics and get them updated tomorrow. They look awesome. Things were a little slow at the beginning, had an issue getting the raw materials but moving well now. The CNC machining of the dice is 90% complete. Many of the dice have been tumbled and look amazing. The laser process begins this week. Hoping to start shipping within the next week to ten days. Hello Backers! Brian here with an update on the dice. Everything is on schedule and moving forward. There have been no set backs (and hopefully there won't be any!). We have received all the material and tools and have commenced production. Next week we will post some videos and pictures. The process for making the dice is broken into two operations. First, I will machine one side on all the dice. Keep in mind, each dice is basically made in 2 halves, not a plane at a time. This is the easier of the operations as I start with over-sized material and machine it down. At this point, the tolerance is a ridiculous .0001 repeatable. Then for each dice, I machine a fixture that mirrors the first operation, some of which may include a vacuum pump to hold the parts. Then I start the second operation. Once the machine is perfect in the three axis, the parts can run. Each lot will be measured and verified for exactness. I will posting more next week including pictures! Thanks everyone! Its been a while since I have been able to enjoy a challenge and make something fun. It appears that the amazon payments issue has been solved and funds will be available this weekend. Brian is ordering the raw materials and we are a go to start production next week. We are so excited to finally get this going. Thanks so much for your support. The media we use does not alter the balance of the dice in any way. That is only applicable to plastic dice, NOT METAL!!!!! I have tumbled all metals for years and have never had an issue with the tolerances or with excess metal coming off one side and not another. Brian Thanks so much for your support of the project. This has been a great learning experience in how Kickstarter works. Brian and I can't wait to bring our dream of making Precision Machined RPG Dice a reality. We could not have done it without your support. I appreciate your patience and understanding in our efforts to bring this project to life. This is where the excitement really begins. We get to get started ordering metal very soon and then reality sets in. We are so excited!! We are so excited to get this project started I can't believe that the campaign is nearly over and we can finally start to produce these dice. It will be amazing to have the opportunity to bring these Precision Machined Metal RPG dice to production. Thank you so much for your pledges and support. Now for the question everybody has been asking. The weights of the d20 dice. Magnesium: 12.32 gr. or .43458 oz. Aluminum: 19.56 gr. or .68996 oz. Titanium: 32.45 gr. or 1.1446 oz. Stainless Steel: 57.95 gr. or 2.0441 Bronze: 60.13 gr. or 2.1210 oz. Copper: 61.5 gr. or 2.1693 oz. Brass: 61.58 gr. or 2.1722 oz. I hope this helps with your weight questions regarding the materials. Dave Our machining technique is the most accurate way to make these dice. In CNC machining, the less you have to move the part by hand the better. As soon as you remove it from the vise and have to rotate or flip it, you lose some accuracy. The more times you do this, the loss of accuracy starts being cumulative. We use a process called surfing, where a round cutter called a ball endmill traces the pattern and moves over in very small increments. This is the same method used in making precision molds. The benefit is extreme accuracy and control. Not only does this mean each side of the die is exactly the same size as all the other sides, but their location is perfectly symetrical to each other. Furthermore, we can add a beveled edge that is the same on every edge, which means the dice have a very satifying feel when you you roll them. Additionally, we only have to rotate the dice once during the manufacturing process, so overall accuracy is very precise. That adds up to incredibly balanced dice. Check out our video showing a four sided dice being 'surfed'. For the finish We start the finish process with a hand buff. Then we use a rotary tumbler with mulitple polishing media to achieve a high polish that showcases each metal. We want to make the metal the star here! Once the dice have the desired surface finish, we laser etch the numbers and seal the finish in with a clear protective spray that won't chip, crack, fade or diminish the shine and color of the metal. It also protects against tarnishing and rust, so the copper based alloys won't patina. Brian The Case is Lined and Cool! There will be more colors available but here is a start. Thanks for your support and please tell your friends and lets get this campaign fully funded!! CNC Production Video of a d4 Six Days - Six days in and we are over 40% of our goal. We really appreciate the support so far and would ask everyone's to help to get the word out to make sure we get a complete funding so these dice can be made. Brian just finished the d6 dice. They look so sweet! These are 18mm. Thanks again and more pics will follow. We also got some pub on the Ravenous RPG blog - Check it out - <url>
