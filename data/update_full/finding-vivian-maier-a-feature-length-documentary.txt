John has just returned from talking at the Format International Photography Festival in Derby, England. Across the world, the interest in Vivian Maier and her story is growing strong. Here on Kickstarter, the power of the crowd has spoken and we've surpassed our minimum goal handsomely. While in our last days, we'd like to thank all of our backers. Thank you! The pre-production will begin soon and we're thankful for resources available for us to make this film well. We're counting down the last days of the pledge drive and any continued support is welcomed and needed. Again, we can't thank our supporters enough for helping us create this film. We'll be working hard to make you proud. Hi everyone, So far we've raised over 80,000 dollars in two months. We still have a month to go and we're amazed at the number of supporters for this project. Over 1250 backers! At this level of support, we can ensure that a quality film will be made. Through our research, we have been able to discover more wonderful stories about Vivian. We've also recently discovered that, not only did she travel to Europe, Asia and the Middle East, but she also traveled extensively throughout Central and South America! What a truly amazing woman. We are grateful to every backer of this project and we can't wait to share these stories with you all. The Chicago Cultural Center exhibition of Vivian Maier's work opened yesterday. The curators said that it was the largest turnout they've ever had for a first floor opening. It was overwhelming. It runs through April 3rd, so if you're in Chicago and, especially if you're a backer, you should take some time to visit the Cultural Center and see her 72 prints on display. The opening reception was documented by wonderful volunteers to our film crew and we owe them a huge thank you! Also, while we were working on this big day, we've doubled our funding goal! We want to thank our almost 800 backers for the continued support. Thank you! The past two weeks has been very exciting. We're very thankful for those who mentioned us on their websites, blogs, Facebook pages, Tweets, etc. Also, thanks to Kickstarter for making us Project of the Day. More importantly, thanks to each and every backer of this project. We've hit our minimum goal! Moving forward, we are still accepting pledges until the clock runs out. All funds will be put toward the film and will most certainly help us move this project forward with less of a hurdle. Pledges can also ensure your pre-ordered copy of the book and DVD. Well, this was a great way to end an extremely productive and exciting year. We have so much in store for this film and we look forward to the hard work we have ahead of us. Happy New Year from John Maloof and Anthony Rydzon We're very happy with the coverage by WTTW's Chicago Tonight on the Vivian Maier story. Please watch the 9 minute segment here: <url>
