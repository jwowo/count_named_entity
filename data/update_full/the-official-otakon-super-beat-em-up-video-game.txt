With very little time left, I've gone ahead and added some rewards requested by our backers. You may now purchase extra copies of the CD Soundtrack and Art Book by themselves. These are hard copies, and are great for folks who wanted extras. =) And finally, we're going to squeak in 3 more Assist Strikers! These went super fast, so grab them up! I hope to see you all tonight in the chatroom at 5PM Eastern time! <url>#CHB Thank you all so much!!! This is really exciting! Less than 24 hours to go now! Thank you, everyone for backing us! Even with the Kickstarter ending, the real fun is just about to begin! I hope you'll all join us over at <url>’re currently working hard on animations and the combo system. The art you see in the trailer is still temporary. It may look good now, but it’s going to get a lot better! That early prototype is the result of only a few short weeks of development, yet gamers were already having a lot of fun playing it at Otakon. We use temporary art while we’re working on the gameplay mechanics to avoid spending time and resources on art assets that may be unusable if they become obsolete as the game’s engine evolves. Speaking of art, I’d like to show another concept piece to introduce a new feature: Assist Strikers! Noise Chan is the first of many assist characters. These helpers will appear and perform a powerful strike attack or temporary power up for you! Noise Chan originates from TrueStar's Noise Channel Radio , which brings us awesome chiptune goodness every Thursday at 10pm Eastern on Arecibo Radio. Along with this feature comes a new reward! Now you can get yourself in the game as an Assist Striker! The Striker assist is just one of many features we’re working to implement. We want to make the fighting system as rich as possible so there are many possibilities for taking the bad guys down. Your hero will become more powerful as you decide just how you want to power them up and customize your fighting style. Combos, launch attacks, air combos, special moves, super moves, team supers, counters, a leveling system, custom skills, the list of features we want to pack into CHB goes on and on. With enough resources, we can make this game huge! Thanks again everybody! I’ll leave you with a clip of some original Eyeshine music, never heard by the public before now. Enjoy! Wow! The "You ini the Game" level sold out in less than a day! We had no idea how popular that would be! To show our thanks, we're going to squeeze even MORE of you in the game! This new reward comes with the collector's edition. =) I can't believe how well we're doing! Thank you everyone for your support!
