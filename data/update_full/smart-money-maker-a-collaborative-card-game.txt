Hi there, I hope you had a nice summer! If you remember last December, my collaborative card game was funded on Kickstarter. Smart Money Maker is now available on Amazon Launchpad ! It’s now easy to order a deck and ship it anywhere! I played SMM again and again in Paris during OuiShare Fest last May and with some friends during the spring and summer. You can find the updated rules to use with your first edition playing cards or enjoy a free print-and-play version for those who don’t yet know about this game and want to get familiarized with collaborative consumption! Please give me your feedback if you have the opportunity to play. Your opinion is important for me. All very best, Laurence Today is a good day!! Smart Money Maker is funded! And to celebrate: Shake Your Money Maker by Elmore James . Please keep sharing the link with your friends and family on Facebook and Twitter during the last day. Smart Money Maker makes a perfect gift, and it will also make you have a great time with your friends and family. This is really the last chance to get an early bird! Thank you again, Laurence Hi there, The campaign will end on Thursday at noon (CET). I really need you to make it happen. Please spread the word on Facebook and Twitter . I also wanted to say thank you to Tyler from Bearded Meeple and his review of Smart Money Maker (watch the video under :)) Thanks again for your support, it's great to have you on board! Cheers, Laurence Thanks so much Kickstarter for featuring my project as a Staff Pick! As per your request, it's possible to pledge several copies of the game. Just leave a public comment or send me a message and I will let you know how much it would be, shipping included. Please share on Facebook or Twitter the game with your friends and family! Thank you! Laurence
