Hi everyone, We’d like to begin this update with our deepest apologies. Through all the challenges we’ve faced, the only thing that has kept us going is your belief in us. The last thing we wanted to do was to disappoint the nearly 8,000 people who generously backed our project so long ago. Unfortunately, some hard news follows. In our last update, we discussed a contract that Flextronics asked us to sign regarding what we were allowed to publish about this project. After reading that update, Flextronics decided they were no longer willing to negotiate the terms of that contract or the language within it. When we were informed of this decision, we were also told that they would like for us to arrange to pick up the parts and equipment we own as production has been halted. This is the latest chapter in what has been a challenging relationship and project to date for everyone involved. Flextronics is a renowned manufacturer who works with the world’s top brands in wearables and other consumer electronics. They’re a good choice for a lot of big, global companies. Unfortunately, in our opinion, it turns out they were not a good fit for the technical challenges of this small startup with, in mass-manufacturing terms, a relatively small number of units. Flextronics is well known for shipping millions of units for many of their customers. We chose Flextronics—above two other manufacturers—because of their expertise in wearables, their location in the US (which enabled us to make frequent trips to California to work on-site), and because they included us in their LAB IX incubation program. We’re sad to say that even with all the knowledge Flextronics has about wearables, little could be transferred, or was relevant to, the specific challenges of the CST-01, namely because of its sub-1mm thickness and sensitive components. We thought working with one of the world’s largest wearable manufacturers would set us up for success. We certainly didn’t think we would ever have to be writing an update like this. Hindsight is always 20/20. If we were to do this all again with the knowledge we now have, we would likely search for a partner that had specific expertise in developing new processes in ultra-thin electronics who was used to working on 10,000 unit runs. We would likely not have limited ourselves to US manufacturers, although, at the time, it was important for us to try to keep as much of the watch made in America as possible. We’ll share “lessons learned” and “mistakes made” in following updates to help anyone in the future avoid some the same challenges we faced. (Deep breath.) The next step is to pick up the parts, assemblies, and tooling that have been paid for that are currently at Flextronics in Milpitas. We’ll work with Flextronics so that all the paperwork is correctly completed and everything can be released into our care. Once we have all the details and paperwork dealt with, we’ll make a trip out to Milpitas to physically load everything and move it. Once we have everything in our own storage, we can do a proper inventory of all these items and take detailed pictures. We know some of you are eager to see this. We haven’t been able to do this as freely as we would’ve liked in the past because of guidelines from Flextronics on what we can share from within the factory walls. Understandably, we have been limited in taking pictures inside their facility because Flextronics doesn’t want competitors to know some of their processes and capabilities. Below is a detailed list of all the items we plan to pick up. There are some parts that Flextronics have paid for that we do not currently own. We have not put those on this list. We also do not own some of the Flextronics machinery needed to assemble the watches such as an ultrasonic welder and a hot bar machine. We’ve had meetings with several organizations who we hoped would be able to help continue production of the CST-01 and get you rewards. To date, however, none of these conversations have been very positive because of the production problems we face. Because of the low, 54% yield, these problems effectively double the costs of the watch, making each cost around $260 to make. At this point, the future looks bleak. A plan somewhere between Plan B and C is now our only option. Here are those plans from the previous update: Plan B: Find buyers for all the above IP, equipment, and parts, liquidating everything we have and redistributing money as required by law. Plan C: In the event that there’s no traction with the above options, we’d essentially make all development “open source” to our backers. We’d share all CAD, schematics, drawings, and design-for-manufacture documentation down to a detailed bill of materials that have all part numbers and suppliers down to the last resistor. We’d share everything we can on how to make the CST-01. We’ve had requests to do this and mail the parts to the backers. This is something we could do, but it’s at the bottom of our list of options because without the proper machinery—hot bar machines, ultrasonic welder, CNC encapsulation machine, specialty adhesives, screen printing, die cutting, etc.—backers simply won’t be able to assemble the watches by themselves. Parts not requested by backers would be liquidated and funds redistributed. As far as liquidation of all assets, we’ll have all photography and inventory of all the pieces and machinery. We have even talked about selling everything on a public site like Ebay so backers can all see the exact amount we’re able to recoup. If there’s anyone out there who has been through anything like this, please reach out. Our friends and families have been incredibly supportive and helpful, but they can only advise us so much. On a personal note, we both have had to take paying jobs to continue to keep this project moving forward and pay for flights and other costs. We’re lucky enough to have employers that know about crowdfunding and the challenges of manufacturing. They are allowing us to keep working on this and give us time for meetings and trips to California. We’d like to end with another apology from us to all of you for letting you down. As disappointed as we are in ourselves, we’re even more sorry to have disappointed our backers. We’re trying to keep our chins up, but we feel awful and are trying to resolve everything as quickly as we can. We’ll make every effort to get to the best outcome possible. Sincerely, Dave &amp; Jerry Where We’re at Now: Our manufacturing partner has estimated they’ll need an additional $1.2M from us for them to fulfill our orders. This is due to the proportion of good products coming off the line and the cost issues we covered in the last update. Over the last few months, we’ve been having conversations with potential investors to try to raise enough money to both complete production and grow the business. The yield concerns, the associated cost, and looking back at the slow pace of development up to this point, however, have made it difficult to impossible to raise the amount of money we need to both scale the business and fulfill orders. When we communicated these things to our manufacturer, they decided to stop the line until it was clear how they would get paid for the completed units, as well as how they would recoup the advances they gave us for this project. There are 135 units ready for shipment at the moment and roughly 200 in process. We’re doing whatever we can to get as many pieces shipped as possible. But, in order to ship the in-process and completed units, our manufacturer is requesting we sign an agreement that would prohibit us from talking openly about some of the challenges we’ve faced during our manufacturing journey. We’re trying to balance our desire to communicate openly and honestly with our backers and customers with trying anything we can to get even a few units shipped. If this proposed agreement moves forward, future updates will be challenging as we’ll be prohibited from sharing many of the facts surrounding the history of the project. We’re currently in conversations with the manufacturer about this agreement and we’ll continue to explore ways to satisfy the manufacturer’s request for additional funds required to continue production while maintaining our ability to keep you as informed as possible. We never dreamed we’d encounter this many challenges for this long. We know we’ve let you all down and we continue to try and keep our chins up and make every effort to reward you for backing us. We’ve been reading your comments and will be addressing some common themes and requests in this update. This is a summary of what we’re covering in this update: Further Financial Information: We’ve put together a timeline from our bank account’s history. We’ve also gone through our photos to pull out images of parts. We hope this is the type of documentation some of you have requested. Plans for Moving Forward: The goal of moving forward is to figure out a way to get rewards to as many people as possible. We’ve outlined our approach below. FAQ: This is meant to cover other questions we’ve received since our last update. Further Financial Information Our bank account balance through time with call-outs during major events. Link for larger size Here’s a little background info to help you interpret this graphic (so you don’t have to go back to previous updates). Our first major purchases were the batteries, the microcontroller (MCU), and the battery management IC. The batteries were long lead-time parts that needed to be ordered well in advance as they were built-to-order and the build process was a lengthy one. The battery management IC was a primary gating item, as it had to be custom processed from a silicon wafer. One wafer would only give us around 6,000 parts. We knew there’d be some yield and one wafer was not enough to build all the 7,900 rewards, so we had to get at least two. The wafers had long processing times (around 16 weeks) and were needed to make the E Ink display (another 8 weeks), so we stage released this and delivered them to E Ink to be placed on the circuits. Once we were fully engaged with our manufacturer, the manufacturer paid for the parts and we paid them in batches, which is why you see many items lumped into three major purchases. The original intent was to order more of these long lead-time parts than were necessary to satisfy Kickstarter backers, so we wouldn’t have six months of down time after fulfilling the original orders. We opened up pre-order sales to pay for the cost of the additional parts. Unfortunately, given the low yield that we’re currently experiencing, additional parts that we hoped would provide us with continued revenue would need to be used to fulfill existing orders. We’ve included images of parts we received further down in the post. Plans for Moving Forward Below are three different options for moving forward in order of preferable outcomes. Plan A: Exchange our intellectual property, techniques, and custom tooling / machinery with a buyer who would complete the rest of the production and fulfillment with our help. The offer would include: Ownership and ability to continue production of the CST-01 under the buyer's own brand. We’d be available to help the new owner transition into producing units. Two patents: A design patent that specifically covers the design of the CST-01 and a utility patent that covers a thin, flexible wristwatch that’s flexible throughout its entire length. Utility Patent 14/590,695: Flexible wristwatch with segmented E-Paper display (still in process). Design Patent D722,894: Flexible wristwatch with segmented E-Paper display. We’ve also developed an encapsulation technology/method for low-temperature and low-pressure molding of flexible elastomeric urethane over sensitive electronics. We needed to develop this process since an E Ink display and a battery wouldn’t be able to withstand the temperatures or pressures involved with a conventional, liquid-silicone rubber, injection-molding technique. This process would be extremely useful for any type of ultra-thin, flexible electronics (wearables, smart cards, etc.). We had a custom CNC machine built to automate this process, which could be repurposed and iterated upon for a range of different devices. We’ll also be available to consult with the buyer to integrate the encapsulation technology we developed into products of their own choosing. The buyer would have the option of patenting this technology and we’d assign the patent to the buyer or keep the process a trade secret. Plan B: Find buyers for all the above IP, equipment, and parts, liquidating everything we have and redistributing money as required by law. Plan C: In the event that there’s no traction with the above options, we’d essentially make all development “open source” to our backers. We’d share all CAD, schematics, drawings, and design-for-manufacture documentation down to a detailed bill of materials that have all part numbers and suppliers down to the last resistor. We’d share everything we can on how to make the CST-01. We’ve had requests to do this and mail the parts to the backers. This is something we could do, but it’s at the bottom of our list of options because without the proper machinery—hot bar machines, ultrasonic welder, CNC encapsulation machine, specialty adhesives, screen printing, die cutting, etc.—backers simply won’t be able to assemble the watches by themselves. Parts not requested by backers would be liquidated and funds redistributed. FAQ: Why is all of this information coming now? Why didn’t you communicate these issues sooner? While we were in the process of trying to get manufacturing going, we didn’t think it would be wise to communicate each and every frustration we encountered. We were concerned that this might negatively affect our working relationship with our manufacturer and our suppliers, leading to more difficulties down the line. What became apparent to us, however, is that designing around bleeding-edge components that are sourced from a single supplier is very risky, especially for a small company. One example is the issue we had with our E Ink displays. We were shipped an estimated 20% broken units that appeared to have been broken due to too much force applied to a component during assembly. This ended up being very costly for us, but what could we do? No one else makes the kind of quality E-Paper displays we needed aside from E Ink. Anything we pursued legally could damage our relationship and destroy our ability to continue production. We aren’t big enough that a supplier would care about cutting us off. Why weren’t the issues you’ve encountered communicated at the onset of the project? The short answer is that, in our opinion, we overestimated the capability of a manufacturing partner to transition a product we were able to make in our workshop to something that could be mass manufactured. We had built working prototypes that were very close to the final form factor we needed. The primary parts that needed refinement were the lamination process, adding color (printing), and the metal band fabrication. The manufacturing partner we chose has a history of making many of the popular wearable technology devices on the market today. We believed they could apply this industry knowledge to take our device that extra step and make it ready for manufacturing. What we learned, however, was that many of the questions we had about how to move forward with production were also echoed by the manufacturing team. CST and the manufacturing team worked on ways to refine the necessary areas, but these efforts ended up needing way more R&amp;D and experimentation than we had anticipated at the start. We also had issues with our suppliers. In addition to the E Ink issue mentioned above, another big issue was that our original battery manufacturer went out of business. One week, things seemed great, then the next, we heard we wouldn’t able to purchase the quantity of batteries we needed. We were able to find a replacement battery that had a similar chemistry and form factor, but, unfortunately, the mechanical properties and the production quality of these replacement batteries wasn’t as good as the original supplier. This, too, led to an unexpected R&amp;D effort around bend testing. We had to come up with a cocktail of adhesives to hold the battery in place where it needed to stay put and let it move where it needed to move. In summary, we were counting on the last pieces of the development process to go smoothly—and the process was anything but. Can we contribute more money and keep manufacturing going? At this point, we’ve concluded this isn’t a good option. If we continue to manufacture at the current yield, it would not only require additional funds that would be in the neighborhood of the original amount backers contributed, but we also don’t have confidence that the manufacturing issues will be ironed out even with additional investment. The last thing we want is to take more money from backers only to continue to run into more manufacturing difficulties going forward. Can you supply pictures of parts? Posted below are some pictures of parts we have. The bulk of the parts are in storage at the manufacturing site and are “kitted out” when a batch of watches is signed off to be assembled. This is why we mostly have photos of the kits sent out, or the boxes of parts when they arrived at the loading dock. Where’s the FCC certification? It was certified by Bay Area Compliance Laboratories Corp. A screenshot of the cover of the report and a photo of one of the tests is below. For further information, the associated update is update #15. Pictures: Hi again, we wanted to add this Financial Summary into last update, but it took about six hours to distill all the technical details into something that could be digestible, and it took the better part of today to get all these things we’re about to share organized in a way that’s easy to follow. This update will show where our money has been spent to date, over the last two years. As many of you are asking about refunds, we wanted to open the books so you can see where the money you’ve contributed has been applied. The money has mostly gone into development, tooling, and purchasing the parts that go into making the watch and charger. We have included detailed pie charts below showing money in and money out. We are also publishing this information to show where we have not spent money. We realized immediately after the Kickstarter campaign ended that we had to run a tight ship and put every penny toward parts, development, and tooling, so we went to extreme lengths to keep our other expenses as low as possible. Finances | The Details Money raised: The chart below shows all the money we raised. There’s a large chunk of money from all the Kickstarter backers and some additional funding post-campaign via pre-orders. You’ll also see $100k of additional outside funding we raised. Money Used: The money spent was separated into into two groups. The first group, money from Kickstarter and pre-orders, was used exclusively for tooling, parts, and development costs of the CST-01. The second group is the additional investment, which we used for our operational expenses. We split our expenses up this way to ensure that your contribution was unequivocally used on the specific manufacturing costs of the CST-01. The first chunk of money went to Kickstarter and Amazon fees. This was for hosting the campaign and processing payments. This was roughly $100k. The money we received from the campaign was $923,634. The Validation, R&amp;D, Shipping &amp; Start Up Costs bucket covers things like creating programming and test fixtures, experimentation of adhesives and materials, test tools for proving out the encapsulation process, sample batteries for evaluation, sample metal bands, and evaluation circuit boards. The largest slice was spent on parts for the watch and the associated tooling. Big-ticket items are the E-Ink display, batteries, battery-management ICs, microcontrollers and clock crystals. Tooling includes injection mold tools for the plastics, dies to form metal bands, diecut tools for trimming circuits, ultrasonic weld tools, and a custom machine for applying adhesives and encapsulants. Here is a break-down of all parts, tooling, programming and certification paid for to-date: Running Lean, Keeping Operating Expenses to a Minimum: Our operating expenses came out of the additional 100k investment. We’ve broken this out below. Certain numbers stand out, for instance, you’ll see that “Compensation” is roughly around $18,000 for two years. This number reflects the net salaries paid to both of us over the two years we’ve been working on CST. This number is low because we not only invested a lot of our own savings into the company, but we paid ourselves the minimum we needed to scrape by month-to-month once the remainder of our personal savings was exhausted. Some things to note are what we’re NOT spending money on. When we could do things ourselves, we did. This includes all of the CAD &amp; specification drawings for the watch, the electrical engineering, a large chunk of the programming, the electrical testing and calculations, making our own programming and testing fixtures, procurement of parts, and identification of outside vendors (for steps that our manufacturer didn't have the capability for). We do not have an office (we worked from home or on-site at our manufacturer). We did not buy computers or software. We did not hire a staff. That has certainly helped as paying for even a small office seems like an unnecessary expense. We both live in Chicago. When we have to travel to San Jose for CST, we organize our schedules so that we can find the cheapest airfare and lodging possible. We found that hotels are too expensive to stay at when we have to be in San Jose for weeks at a time (even the cheapest hotels can be over $100 a night per room). So, AirBnB always comes out as the cheapest option. We sort options by price and select the cheapest possible accommodations. Most recently, Dave has been spending almost every other week on-site. Because money is tight, Dave took the cheapest possible option for accommodations to the extreme. He rented a van from AirBNB with a futon in the back that he parks in the manufacturer’s parking lot. It’s $35 a day, so he gets transportation and somewhere to sleep. Again, since we’re mostly working when we’re on-site, these sparse accommodations don’t really matter too much, and it has allowed us to be at the manufacturer’s site more often in recent months. What This Means for Delivery of Watches As you can see from the numbers here and in the last update, continuing production at this time is a challenge. We have the majority of the parts needed, but are struggling with the yield and the costs involved to assemble them into final units. At the moment, we don’t have the reserve funds to make up for the yield and labor costs. We are currently investigating options that may allow us to get units out to the backers and continue to produce, but the details of these conversations are still in the early stages. We will be shipping as many watches as possible and are working with the manufacturer to see how many watches can be shipped. We hope that this update helps to communicate that we have been doing everything in our power to get through these issues and get these products out to you folks. We’re deeply sorry for what looks like may be a negative outcome and it pains us to write this post. We assure you that we will continue to look for ways we can get watches out to you and we will ship every last watch we are able to. -Dave &amp; Jerry Production numbers and speed of production are much lower than estimated, initial production was initially estimated at 1,000 - 2,000 units per week from our manufacturer. The production line is far from running at full efficiency as we encounter issues and have to install additional steps for testing. That estimate is currently at 200 units per week. As we work on the line training operators, actual production including yield was only 130 over the past 2 weeks. We kept the first batch small in order to see how the watches did in the field. Unfortunately, we had a higher percentage of failures and returns than we were comfortable with. In order to prevent shipping more unreliable products, we went back through the steps of the production process to find where those errors were and added more testing to ensure that we ship robust units. This process added more delays to our goal of getting units out the door. We continue to work on our process in order to get our yield and costs into a range that will enable us to ship to our backers with the amount of parts we have on hand. This is very disappointing to us and we know incredibly frustrating for all of you. Below is an explanation of what’s happening to date as we continue to make all efforts to get these numbers into a more respectable range. A brief summary shows where we are getting an incredibly low percentage of shippable product. We are getting failures of parts and then additional failures as we go through assembly steps. This all adds up to 44% of all the products not being ‘shippable’ as they fail functional or cosmetic tests at various points in the assembly. The details on production and yield challenges. E-Ink circuits: We are getting 80% yield on these parts out of the box. We have tried many approaches to rework the failed circuits. None of the rework approaches have yet managed to get the failed circuits to work. The reason that 20% of circuits are failing is that too much pressure was applied to the battery management chip during assembly, This effectively crushed and destroyed the chip. The units were not tested to our electrical specification, and as a result, we were shipped boards with 20% failed parts, which not only adds 25% to the per-part-cost, but also adds cost in testing to weed out the failed units. As these parts are one of the most expensive parts of the watch, we have been investigating ways to avoid eating this 25% cost increase. We have successfully tested and documented a process for removing this part but have been unsuccessful in finding a vendor willing and capable of removing the parts and attaching replacement parts. The battery management chip is a custom bare die part cut from a thinned silicon wafer (In short...It’s tiny and a real challenge to place and attach) We are working on other ways to regain that 20% loss, but we may have to realistically live with the loss. The Batteries - Attaching and Encapsulation. The battery supplier has been incredibly proactive in attempting to fix issues and sent an expert from France to San Jose to thoroughly test and document the challenges with these batteries. Tests covered thermal, mechanical and visual inspection guidelines. Visual inspection show that some batteries have visual defects (bubbles) that indicate that they may not be electrically sound in the long term. Pull and stress tests were conducted on the battery tabs to see where these tabs would fail or fall off. The results of this in depth investigation mean we now know we have an 80% yield (20% of the batteries fail after we put them through tests and inspection) This yield issue effectively makes the cost of the battery per product also 25% higher. Compounding this issue is that even when the batteries get past the inspection, these ‘good’ batteries go through the production and assembly are attached to the E-ink circuits, These circuits are then encapsulated in a flexible resin. Additional bending and stress tests are conducted after this step. 10% of these assemblies fail those tests. The result is that those entire failed assemblies become scrap. This points either refinement needed on battery protection or a more stringent battery tab pull test required. We found that failures in the shipped units may have been due to a battery attachment problem. We tracked down that there were a batch of units where the incorrect solder was used on the line causing unconnected cold solder joints on the battery. (The solder had the wrong melting temperature and could not "wet" fully to attach the batteries). We have added confirmation steps to ensure the correct solder is used moving forward. Assembling to bands The final few steps are to attach the encapsulated circuits to the bands and then bend test the final product. We get an additional 77% yield here (23% of the final products fail at final testing.) The primary point of failure at this point is delamination of either the battery tabs from the battery or the battery tabs from the circuit board. Once this happens, the only salvageable part of the assembly is the metal band. What does all the above mean? We get a cumulative yield of 55%-56%. with all the testing that is necessary this is very time consuming and requires real human attention at every step of the process. In cold cash terms it balloons the parts and labor cost to around $300. The low yield effectively doubles the production costs. This is obviously something we need to improve in order to be able to deliver rewards to everyone. If we kept the line running with the yield we are seeing, we would not be have enough parts to send to all the backers. We understand your frustration and hope that by pulling back the curtain to talk about the problems we have encountered, we will be able to communicate what is keeping us from getting these watches out currently. We will continue to be as transparent as possible in future updates. - Dave &amp; Jerry | CST Hello Backers, Last week, we worked with our manufacturer to finish building, testing, and shipping our first batch of products! We'd like to share a few photos of this final process: Final Testing: Ready for packing: Scanning base station serial numbers: Boxing up: Ready for delivery: We are delighted with how the product has turned out and are excited to be getting them onto your hands. At this stage we are being careful to start slow to make sure our process has all of the kinks worked out of it. For those of you who are curious how we are going about the shipping queue, we are shipping by both order number and the SKU that we are currently producing. We have started with the black, raw titanium, medium watches for this shipment, but will be changing the line over to cover the different color and sizes in subsequent orders. Now would be a good time to make sure your address is correct in the Kickstarter system. If you are unfamiliar with how to update your address, we wrote a brief tutorial here: <url>| CST Hello Backers, We are back from another couple of trips out to the manufacturer and have some progress to share with you. New Steel Tools and Cavities We found that some of the yield issues we brought up in the last update were due to a tool in our molding machine flexing. We modified the molding process and made a new tool from steel that does not flex, so all of the units show much more consistency than previously. The photos at the top of this post are from encapsulation tests we have been running. We are currently addressing some issues we are seeing with the encapsulant on the small size units and running bending stress testing to make sure it does not have any issues before we ship the product. These tests are currently in progress. The Batteries We have a documented test procedure, and have tested a batch of batteries with this procedure to make sure the batteries we use are good and mechanically sound. Dave personally inspected the batteries that pass this test and found a small subset of the batteries seem questionable. We are waiting to hear back from the battery manufacturer for their recommendation on how to resolve the issue. The Bands The issues with the bands look like they are becoming resolved. We have received a batch of bands from the manufacturer and while we currently need to test every unit to determine whether it meets spec, we are seeing that we are getting a good yield of bands and should be able to get to 100% in spec in time. Moving Forward The last two hurdles are making sure the units pass bend testing and resolving the battery issues. Once we are past this, our plan is to start getting these out the door to you. Once again, we were delaying the update until we could say "we started shipping!" since it looked like it would be just a week or two out for the last few weeks. We apologize that our update cadence is slower than many of you would prefer, so we will be revising our approach to keep you informed irregardless of whether the milestone we anticipated was met. We will be back visiting the manufacturer again next week and we will post a brief update after that trip as well. Thank you all again for your patience and support. -Dave, Jerry &amp; the CST Team The first samples made with all final manufacturing processes: We just returned from another 2 week trip to California to work closely with our manufacturing partner. Above are the first units produced with 100% of the parts and processes that will be used in final manufacturing and they look great! The issues that remain are the bands, batteries and yield targets which we'll dive into below. The Batteries As we started to assemble our test units, we found that the batteries have some issues where some units have tabs that aren’t well adhered. The good news is that the battery supplier is extremely proactive in fixing the issue and we are working closely with them to document a testing procedure to weed out and replace problematic units. Close-up showing a tab not well adhered Dialing in the Process and Increasing Yield Throughout this journey, our bill of materials has increased. From issues with E Ink displays, the original battery partner closing shop, and the move to Nitinol bands has left us with very little room for scrapping parts that don’t come off the line perfectly. With sample in-spec bands, we were able to assemble 7 working units. However, this was from a batch of 16 circuits. The main reason for the low yield is due to the aforementioned battery tab issue. We are addressing the issues in order to get the yield back to a reasonable number before we can pull the trigger on high volume manufacturing. The Bands We’ve been working for weeks to get a schedule from the supplier for when we will be receiving bands in California. Delivery dates and quantities were in a state of flux, so we had been waiting to update until we had parts in-hand. Unfortunately, as of right now, the bands have still not arrived. So, what’s been happening? At the point we approved the first article parts we were told that 200 parts a day was a safe estimate of what would be produced. It took us several weeks to track down why we were not receiving parts as promised. It appears as though the supplier was having some challenges meeting that estimate due to machining tolerance creating a lot of ‘scrap’ parts that were outside specification. It turned out that the bands were not being measured according to our instructions, so many “scrap” parts were actually good, we also looked at their measurements and found ways to loosen tolerances without impacting the design in order to help them reach yield targets. As of yesterday 200 in-spec bands were due on the loading dock in California, but we just received a note that the 200 units that were supposed to ship were not shipped since the vendor had missed a process step (cleaning) and the parts were out of spec, so they were returned to the vendor. Our manufacturing partner has installed daily updates and check ins and have also mobilized a team to be at the band manufacturing site to oversee production in order to resolve the issues in getting these made. We will continue to update you as we get more information about the shipment. The cautious approach and the careful delivery schedule from the supplier is likely due to the following reasons: -The raw material costs for Nitinol sheet is incredibly high, running ‘failed parts’ and rushing them through the line is a costly error, running them slowly will get the supplier a better yield and less scrap parts...ultimately they will get more ‘good’ parts that pass inspection that we have paid for. -In ‘mass manufacturing’ it would be normal to run 2,000 or so parts through the line to check and measure them to make sure consistency was reached, in our world that would be around $50,000-$100,000 in parts to ‘check’ the system..or roughly 10% of all backing Kickstarter backing money to ‘check’ the system. -Internal systems are in place that check FAI (first article parts) and lead to PPAP (Production part approval process) these processes are internal to the supplier and it has taken sometime for those internal processes to be opened up to us in order for us to successfully collaborate on arriving at a solution. This supplier has invested a lot of time and effort so far in getting these processes fine tuned. -Chinese “Golden Week” was the 1st of October to the 7th of October, this means the lines ramped down and came back up upon return. We have been hand assembling circuits to bands and continue to refine and prepare all the other steps of the process for the arrival of these bands. Fingers crossed we will be receiving these bands at 1,000 to 2,000 units per week, meaning about a month of production time. Moving Forward Having two people at CST handle the design, packaging, engineering, CAD, process development and documentation for a product has been quite a handful. In some ways this has been good for us allowing us to weather these numerous delays by staying small, but it also means that sometimes communication suffers and we apologize for this. The manufacturing partner is now providing more support to get us across the finish line and dial in these details to increase yield. We are systematically addressing these last few issues around yield and the bands. We understand that you are anxious to get the watches and we cannot wait to get these out to you too! - Dave, Jerry and the CST team We received the fourth round of sample bands today from our metal partner and are happy to communicate that everything is looking right on for the dimensions. We have checked these here in Chicago and will compare notes with the manufacturer in the next day or so when the factory returns to work after observing a lunar holiday. At that point, we’ll give clearance to get the production lines going for these parts. Below, you’ll find a quick dimensional survey completed on these samples. Our measuring equipment has an approximate tolerance of plus or minus 0.005mm for thickness, and plus or minus 0.01mm for those “interior” dimensions which are less critical. (Basically, the spreadsheet and the parts prove that everything will now fit). In summary, this is looking MUCH better. Communication Lapse First off, we know we need to do a better job communicating and apologize for the lapse. We thought that if we just put 100% of our effort into kicking off shipping that this update would read “We started shipping!” and this would answer about 95% of your questions and e-mails. We want to make sure it's known that we are not going anywhere and are committed to getting you your rewards as quickly as possible. The reason that we usually prefer bigger updates is that if we publish an update with lacking information, it actually increases the amount of questions we get instead of the intended result of decreasing inbound questions. We know that we need to provide you a better "heartbeat" to make sure we're still working, so we will do better at providing this moving forward. Wrestling Nitinol Bands Into Mass Production The nitinol bands are the key part that is holding up the entire project plan. We know that many of you are frustrated with these delays and so are we. It’s been about 5 months since we received the first nitinol sample band. We have been through 3 sample rounds with the supplier, each round taking a more time to produce and receive than anticipated. Never has it been clearer that the tolerances we are attempting to hold and the thickness goal we aim to achieve is something that is very unique compared with more routine requests in manufacturing. Each round presented it’s own type of quality control problems. The first round were simply not thin enough, the second round were almost thin enough but had the incorrect surface finish, the third round, although thin enough, had major tolerance oversights in the other dimensions, meaning the flexible circuit module would not fit within the pocket. With much discussion on how we could work with the bands as they were, we had to make the painful decision go through another round of samples to get the parts right. We are ASSURED by Flextronics and the supplier that these will have none of the previous issues presented in the prior rounds of samples. Flextronics are shoulder to shoulder with us and are as surprised as we are that this has taken so long to dial in. Daily late night calls, passionate debates, the creation of incredibly detailed quality control documents, tighter and tighter tolerance definition, fabrication of measurement tools and fixtures have helped isolate and solve the problems we were seeing. Here are some images of one of the measuring devices that has to be used directly after the forming process, there is an 18 page document associated with all dimensions and tolerances that each and every band must pass to be correct for the final product. We are poised to receive that 4th (and, again we are assured, final round) of what are called ‘golden samples’ within the next few days. These were planned to ship on August 31st, but have been delayed and finally shipped out on September 3rd. With shipping times and customs these should be in our hands September 8th or 9th. Once approved we should then receive large orders of these parts over the following weeks. The nitinol manufacturing partner can supply 200 bands a day for the first week or so then 400 a day as they refine the process. it should mean that we’ll be staggering our ship out to all of you as we receive those parts, rather than waiting for them all to be completed. Other Activities We just finished a trip to California where we continued to tune circuit encapsulation, color and hard coating to increase quality and yield. We want to make sure we are managing all the different process so that we get a high yield of usable sub-assemblies. We’ve also been analyzing other parts of the assembly process and refining those to increase output per day in preparation for the roughly 2000 bands that should be arriving each week. After printing Die cutting Jig for assembling modules to bands Inspecting die cut fit Next week at TechCrunch We will have a few demo units assembled onto some of the sample bands we received on display from Monday 9/8 to Wednesday 9/10 as part of the Flextronics Lab IX booth at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco. Dave will be manning the booth most of the time, so if you are around come say hi! Schedule As far as a new ship date, we are faced with the challenge of whether we give you the date we expect, as we have been doing (which means we assume that no more unexpected delays come in to us) or do we assume that another new delay of some sort is bound to occur and give you a safer date. If we play the safe route, many of you will ask why it is so far away, and the answer would be “we don’t know, because we are accounting for the unknown”. That said, we have no information that would point to further significant delays after we get these bands. There will be a “ramp-up” period where the quantities of units out the door has not yet gotten to the pace we eventually will get to, but we should be able to start getting these out the door in the coming few weeks. Thanks again to everyone for their support and patience during this process. We are looking forward to getting these to you as soon as we can! Dave, Jerry and the CST Team. Hello from Milpitas, CA, We're once again in California in the Flextronics facility working with them daily to get the kinks out of the process and streamline manufacturing. Here's where we're at on a few items: The Bands: We are going back and forth with our vendor to dial the tolerance in. It looks like they should be able to meet us half way on our tolerance request. Concurrently, we have been able to modify our molding machine to encapsulate the electronics in a slightly thinner package, to get us back to where we need to be. Our tooling for these bands is set to complete in about a week's time. At that point, they will be able to give us a schedule for the delivery of these at scale. We will keep you posted once we receive the schedule. The Base The base station build is going well. We have tested base stations from the first units off of the line and they work and look great. Ultrasonic welding the board into the enclosure: We know all of you are eagerly awaiting your watches, and we hope we can communicate to you our complete dedication to this project. We know that when we get these watches out, the will be of a caliber that we feel proud of and you will feel good about wearing. We will start shipping as soon as we can get these wrapped up, which we hope will be in a matter of weeks. Thank you all for your support and patience. -Dave, Jerry &amp; the CST Team The results are in. We're calling it because ever since we launched the survey, the results read roughly 65/35 in favor of taking the time we need to get the bands in tolerance. There was never any kind of variation in the results over time, and we see no reason why they would change drastically the longer this is left open. We assure you this does not mean we will be taking our time getting these out! We will continue to work as hard as possible to get the watches to you as soon as possible AND have them be within the original planned tolerance. Thank you for your participation. Best, Dave, Jerry and the CST Team Hello backers, we just got back from another 2 week trip working at Flextronics and we have a status update to share with you. The main news is that all steps of the process, except for one, have parts and are underway. The one thing holding us back is the manufacture of the nitinol bands. We got the first sample of a nitinol band in early March. Since then we have received a round of samples that did not meet our thickness tolerance specification, and a second batch of samples that keeps getting delayed. We are frustrated at the pace of development with the current supplier and are now looking into alternative suppliers who could potentially help speed things up. We know that many of you are anxiously awaiting your watches, so we decided to make a survey. The purpose of the survey is to inform us whether more people want us to ship the watch sooner, or if more people care about an approximate 0.15mm thickness tolerance increase: The reason we had our original specification was to keep all watches thinner than the $15,000 0.98mm Delirium IV from 1979. While it was an engineering marvel, where the band meets the case is visibly larger than 1.10mm, and the watch was “so delicate it could not be worn because the case would bend when you strapped the watch to your wrist”. For these reasons, we still feel that delivering a watch where some units are up to 1.1mm thick still qualify as the world’s thinnest watch. However, we feel the right thing to do is ask you what you think. It boils down to this: one option is to keep working on getting the tolerance dialed in. This could take more time to complete since we have not yet seen Nitinol samples that pass the original spec. The other option is to move ahead with the bands we have seen and get these watches out sooner. Fortunately, the bands are the last step in the process, so we can stock up on the subassemblies of the watches and the final step will be putting them on the bands after the bands arrive. Here’s the link to that survey, help us make the right decision to move forward: <url>’s another piece that has to be done by someone! Thanks you all for the support. We apologize for the delays, and are working as hard as we can to get these out to you as quickly as possible. Best, Dave, Jerry, &amp; the CST team. A lot happened in the past couple of weeks. As promised, we have some photos of our trip to share with you. This update will be more of an annotated photo gallery. One of the big steps we made was setting up our custom-built encapsulation machine. The watch has some very unique requirements that led us down the path of inventing a new manufacturing technique along with a custom built machine in order to produce it. We worked along-side the company who made the machine for the better part of 3 days, tuning and programming it to get it to work just right. Here's a picture of what it looked like when it arrived: Believe it or not, attaching the battery has actually been a very difficult process to get right (and repeatable). The process we got to seems like we finally nailed it. Some samples from the final PVD vendor: We dialed in the formulations for the ink colors and protective coatings with our print vendor: The Base Station circuit boards are being populated and are getting ready for programming: Dave programming the first panel: That's it for now. We return to Flextronics next week and will have more to share! Best, Dave, Jerry and the CST team TL;DR: We are slightly behind schedule. Three areas in the list of 60 or so things to complete have required more tuning to pass dimension tests and assembly. This has moved the first ship date to be more likely the 3rd - 4th week of May for first shipment. The 3 areas that have impacted shipping: Plastic Parts The plastic flow issues and molding marks on the overmolded part for the base station that were evident last month proved difficult to tune with no concrete deadline to resolve them. So, instead we modified the tool geometry, added a slide to mold a tiny hole for the LED light and changed to an opaque overmold rubber, this got rid of the flow marks and we can see the LED. Some additional tool tuning is required to get the USB area to look good. These tooling changes took about 5 days to complete. Also, the top plastic part in the base station was moving around while being ultrasonically welded. This meant that the cover of the base station would not reliably be attached and be flush with the sides of the base station. We modified the tool, and fixed the issue. Final tuned tools will be complete on April 24th, about two weeks later than planned, We should be receiving all plastic parts on about April 30th. Nitinol Bands The first sample shipment of the bands did not pass a dimension check inspection, the wall of this part has to be around 0.2mm in order to be the world’s thinnest, when inspected this wall measured about 0.29mm, We adjusted the process with the partner and are expecting to get accurate bands within 2 weeks for assembly. The Encapsulating Machine Once built this machine went through several tests and showed overflow in the tool and the lines. This was estimated to to take one week to completely debug, but has actually taken about 6 days longer. This machine was shipped from China on Monday. Once this arrives, we will be working with the machine to do some final tweaks to the settings to get this humming along. This again, represents another piece in the puzzle that stacks up to a an approximate two week impact on the shipping schedule. Parts we have on-site that are good to go: The following list are the parts we have qualified, tested and are ready to be implemented once the other pieces of the puzzle fall into place: Base station PCBs All electrical components Zinc weights Torsional springs USB cables E-ink displays All adhesives Batteries Watch programming fixture Battery attachment tool and machine Hot bar tool and machine Ultrasonic weld tooling and machine (for attaching the PCB to Base Station plastics) Watch assembly station. Things for this week and next: Setting up shipping computer and label printer for ship out Installing software for programming &amp; testing multiple watches at once Top plastic and Pivot part plastics arrival Receiving customer packaging Receiving shipping packaging Receiving and tweaking encapsulation machine Production and delivery times. We’ve been optimizing the assembly process, this requires training 4 operators per task as there will be two shifts per day working on getting these watches and base stations assembled, put in boxes and shipped out. Estimates for production times are currently looking like 200-250 units made and shipped out per day, this means that all backers will receive their rewards within 30 days or so from first shipment. We will continue to optimize that process and try to increase daily output. We will be organizing orders by date of pledge received and by batches of SKUs to increase efficiency, meaning early backers will be in the first 2-3 days of full production shipping. We’re working with the shipping software company “Endicia” and currently setting up our shipping and tracking station. This means that you will get a personal email from the system when the unit is shipped out with tracking and a delivery date. This coming month of activities We will be overseeing every step of the assembly and ship out process for the foreseeable future to ensure quality and function are not compromised. We got into this to create a beautiful, well designed watch, and we will be on-site to make sure that's what we deliver. New update cadence This update is a bit different from previous ones that had more imagery and video. Since we are fast approaching a first ship out, we will post shorter, more pointed, and frequent updates showing photos &amp; videos of the production details as well as keeping you up to speed on things closer to real-time. Thank you! We want to make sure we take some of this space to thank all of you for your support and patience while we get through these last steps. This month, like every one previous, is looking like one with very little time for sleep. Dave, Jerry &amp; the CST team FAQ We’ve been getting a lot of similar questions, so we’ll be publishing a FAQ at the bottom of our updates in order to answer the majority of questions we receive. When will you be shipping? Please read the above update for details on a shipping schedule. What order will you be sending out watches? I’m getting married / It’s my wife’s birthday / our anniversary so I hope to get mine first. Rewards will be sent out approximately in the order they were received. This is the only fair way to schedule it. We’re doing everything we can to get them out as soon as possible. Has the survey gone out yet? Yes. If you need to change your address, please see the last update on how to do so (please do not post comments about it) How can I change my shipping address? See above Using the size chart, my wrist is just barely inside of (one size) and barely outside of (another size), which size do I choose? Using the size chart, you should choose the size where the band is inside the "size range" square (not outside). There’s no overlap in the sizing chart, and no space between sizes, so you should be inside of one of the areas. If it's really right on the line, think about whether you want a watch that will be able to move a bit on the wrist with some room to breathe, or if you want a snug, streamlined fit that will never get caught on cuffs. We have found it really comes down to personal preference. I'm a distributor/reseller/vlogger and would like a sample for… Production samples are not ready yet. The DVUs we do have are not final parts and are not ready for evaluation by suppliers or testers. Where can I buy one? / I just found out about this Kickstarter and still want to pre-order one. / I would like to order additional colors. We’re still in the process of producing the CST-01, so they’re not shipping currently. If you’re interested in getting your name on the list for when we do ship, you can pre-order watches on our site: centralstandardtiming.com . Orders will be fulfilled in the order they were placed. Thanks for the interest! I see that there’s one watch left at the $99 level, how do I get that one? The Kickstarter campaign has ended. That statement is a bug in the Kickstarter system that we’ve requested to have removed. We’ve been told that removing this statement is not possible, so you’ll just need to take our word that the campaign is over and there are no "early bird" rewards left. However, we’re still taking pre-orders on our site: centralstandardtiming.com . The TL;DR: Items and sub-assemblies are on schedule. We still have some challenges to overcome, but things are looking promising. Most of our updates focus on the ‘wins’, This time we’ve decided to share a short list of some of those frustrating, behind the scenes details that consume our time and caused Jerry to lose his voice this month ;) It’s definitely more than a full time job in order to keep this running smoothly. We’re still jazzed to be doing this, grateful to you all as always, and excited for the final product, but thought you might find it interesting to hear about some of these stories behind the scenes. Overmolded Base Station Parts This one seemed like something that we should not lose sleep over, but tiny challenges popped up and needed to be addressed to keep us on schedule. The actual plastic resin pellets used in the injection molding machine for the overmolding process need to have a low “shore hardness” (meaning soft &amp; flexible) and has to be slightly translucent to allow our LED to shine through. At the beginning of the month it was proving challenging to to get the resin for the injection molding machine to actually ‘work’. It was flexible enough, but the pigment needed to be tuned to get the right translucency and there were flow marks through the final parts (because the pigment in the resin pellets were not mixed thoroughly) The parts we were receiving were more than good enough to get us through testing assembly machines and ultrasonic welding jigs etc...so all that kept running smoothly. We rolled up our sleeves and began engaging alternate resin suppliers in China to custom formulate that overmold resin, We found three potential other suppliers and did all the work to get them all to deliver custom samples of their resins in pellet form to the injection molders at Flextronics. After a month of iterations, trials, late night calls and expediting samples to the injection molder we hear that this issue has been overcome and we should have final parts within a week or so. So, the plastic parts are on schedule and will not be impacting fulfillment, but we figured we’d provide a little peek into what it took to keep us on schedule. Zinc Weights We were working with several partners for molding these zinc weights that act as counter weight in the Base Station. We were shocked at the incredibly long delivery times and bad communication from all these partners. 60-90 days for delivery was unacceptable. We decided to go out on our own and find a new vendor. We found three and requested quotes. We narrowed that to a single new partner within 2 days after making the decision to source this on our own. We had new molds made and they delivered perfect sample parts to us in about 14 days after the initial conversation. We receive all our zinc parts in about a week, in less than half the time the other suppliers were committing to, the communication from the new supplier is amazing, with regular updates and always meeting or exceeding deadlines. We’re so happy that this little part will not be causing any issues to our schedule. Springs To show the level of detail that we have had to get down to, we had to get a custom-made spring that goes in the base station. It allows the contacts of the base station to make contact with the watch, yet get out of the way when the watch is removed. Programming the Base Station Microcontroller We have a microcontroller in the base station that requires programming. We have a certain amount of un-programmed parts in hand, and pre-programmed chips should arrive in a few weeks. In order to make sure we get watches out to you guys as quickly as possible, we decided to make a programming fixture so we can use the un-programmed parts we were able to source sooner. This also gives us the flexibility to reprogram panels in the future if we find bugs or want to add functionality. What we had to do: We designed and made a programming jig for that assembly line, it programs an entire panel of these PCB’s, 33 at a time, meaning we can program over 60 panels an hour.. This means, worse case scenario, we can program all the boards for our backers in about 4 hours, which will probably be one of us sitting in the assembly line… The idea for this style of programmer came from Pete Lewis at Sparkfun. Below is a picture of our inspiration (Thanks Pete!) In tandem, we had a test fixture company do a professional fixture for the programming of the actual watches themselves. We just got photos of the final embodiment today and it looks pretty bomb-proof! Titanium bands We had to work through some details on the Titanium bands. While we were able to form individual bands by hand, when we attempted to have these formed at scale and heat treated to keep their shape, the heat-treating didn’t turn out so well: In heat treatment, the bands were getting damaged to the point of failure, so we have a couple pathways moving forward to remedy this. We are testing a Titanium alloy called “nitinol” that is getting phenomenal spring back and beautiful aesthetics. We are also refining our heat treatment technique to get the grade 5 titanium to keep it’s shape, and survive the process. We are confident that we will get to a good solution and will share news with you as it arrives. Packaging Packaging samples came in and they are looking great! See for yourselves: Certification We have our certificate of compliance so we can use all of those logos on our packaging that will allow us to ship to your various locations! This Coming Month of Activities &amp; Risk Items - We just got off a call with our manufacturer. We placed an order at the beginning of this month for a hot bar fixture that we will use for connecting our battery and for connecting our flex circuit to our rigid board on our base station. These fixtures should be arriving in the next week or so, but they have been delayed. We are doing what we can to make sure this won't impact our timeline. - We get samples of our different titanium band options next week, we will continue to push this to keep it on schedule. - We will receive one custom fabricated machine from China specifically designed for our process of encapsulating our watch circuit boards. We’ll also be tuning all the other machines for PCB assembly, programming, ultrasonic welding, heat staking, and hot-bar assembly of the base station. - We are finalizing secondary packaging for shipping to backers (These will be marked with all necessary notes and labels to ensure they are free to travel without customs problems). This month, like every one previous, is looking like one with very little time for sleep. -Dave, Jerry &amp; the CST team FAQ We’ve been getting a lot of similar questions, so we’ll be publishing a FAQ at the bottom of our updates in order to answer the majority of questions we receive. When will you be shipping? Please read the above update for details on a shipping schedule, it is expected to be the last week of April What order will you be sending out watches? I’m getting married / It’s my wife’s birthday / our anniversary so I hope to get mine first. Rewards will be sent out in the order they were received. This is the only fair way to schedule it.

There’s no overlap in the sizing chart, and no space between sizes, so you should be inside of one of the areas. If it's really right on the line, and you don't know what to choose, we recommend the smaller size since the bands can be spread out slightly to accommodate larger wrists easier than they can be made smaller.

However, we’re still taking pre-orders on our site: centralstandardtiming.com . What’s Happened &amp; What's In Progress - Our battery partner has delivered all the custom units. - The final watch circuit boards are all in our possession , currently being integrated into Flextronics inventory management. - First article parts for the Base Station plastics have arrived , been tested and second article parts are on their way. After tuning of the tool, we can crank out the parts for all our backers quickly. - The first titanium bands in all three sizes and all three colors are arriving shortly. We’ve improved the geometry to look and feel way better. (softer edge, perfect brushing and good spring back) - Getting fully embedded in the Flextronics system has taken a lot of hard work to make sure we’re adhering to the standards put in place by those systems. - Packaging has been finalized and is in production. - We have a very detailed production plan in place. We’ve worked with Flextronics and all the 12 separate teams all week to nail down the final integration plan and ultimately get us to a fulfillment schedule. (there is a an edited down, but still detailed Gantt chart later in this post for those who crave the details) Waterproofing We know how interested everyone is in making sure the watch is water resistant, and we’ve gotten there. It’s taken fractions of millimeter adjustments and a ground-up redesign (since the first prototypes) of the assembly process to ensure no water can get in. We have not conducted highly scientific tests at this stage, but the CST-01 functions when submersed in water, and after being submersed in water continues to function. We have booked time at the Flextronics testing facility so we can get the water resistant certification (ISO 2281 water-resistant watches standard) Bonus USB Functionality We have been keeping this close to the chest, but it is at a point where we can talk about it now. We have added USB data functionality, so when the base station is connected to a computer it enables a few additional features. In the future (most likely after we have delivered the watches), we will be able to give you an application that will automatically update the watch to the computer’s system time. For the hackers out there, there will be a command-line tool that will allow you to write custom applications so you can have a tethered watch show any time you want (time of the next train, time until your next meeting etc…). This was the type of thing that we put off because it falls in the “optional” category. To make sure we weren’t distracted by this, we got some coding help from our friend Tod Kurt who became an expert in this field making the fantastic internet-connected USB LED called the blink(1) . Base Station Even though CAD for the tool was finalized many months ago, it takes 8 weeks to cut all the steel, assemble the moving parts and texture the tools. We have received the first parts of this tool, but it must now go through ‘tuning’ to get good quality parts aesthetically and mechanically. What does that mean? We will be fine tuning the flexible overmold so that buttons feel good to push. The level of pigment in that resin will be adjusted to make sure the status LED is easily visible. The pressure and temperature of the plastic that is injected into the tools will be tuned to eliminate sink and flash marks where the plastic flows between the pieces of steel. We will also be adding textures to certain surfaces to get them to come out of the tool easier and look good. Once the tooling is tuned then these parts can be produced at in less than a minute each. Band Production We’ve been tuning this process as well to get aesthetically beautiful parts that have the best springback properties. Flextronics is working on finalizing this in all three sizes and all three colors, Scheduled delivery of those first parts about 3 weeks from today. We needed your sizes in the survey to know how many of each band to have made. Customer Packaging We’ve worked hard with Jansy LLC Packaging to develop final packaging that will protect your watch while in transit and look good, Here are some images of that final packaging, These arrive in about 5 weeks. FCC &amp; CE certification The FCC reports have been filed and some of the additional CE certification is getting finalized. We borrowed an ESD (Electro-static Discharge) gun to perform some of our own tests outside of the testing lab in order to feel even more confident about the watch’s reliability. The Schedule Due to the challenging nature of what we are doing (&lt;1mm curved, flexible electronics), there have been many new processes and manufacturing techniques that need to be not only developed but proven and qualified so they can be added to the Flextronics system. This has been a more challenging and detailed task than is usual for a typical product development process. Flextronics have been willing to experiment and add these new capabilities faster than they have done in the past, so Kudos to them for stepping up to the plate on this and quickly qualifying new ways to manufacture. We will still be assembling our watches in California, but are leveraging the global expertise Flextronics has to make sure we are using the best resources available to us. For us, this means working with teams in both the USA and China. Our schedule has been challenged by the most recent holiday season in both countries. For instance, one major part of the puzzle is a custom automation machine being developed to reliably manufacture some of our assemblies. This is being fabricated at a Flextronics location in China, another of Flex’s locations in China is also handling vital parts of the Titanium production. We’ve concentrated this past week on tying up loose ends and making sure all the development and all the separate partners are lining up. It’s kind of like spinning plates, it has to be constantly monitored and we have to make sure we are delivering all information and engineering tweaks or feedback on quality control to all the partners in a timely fashion. This means delivering drawings and information to 12 separate teams on a daily basis. This level of management can be quite demanding, and is especially so when we are developing new manufacturing techniques to do something that has never been done before. Below is an incredibly detailed Gantt chart that has taken us the better part of a week to wrestle together, it shows when all the separate parts and sub-assemblies come together and we begin to ship in batches. As you can see there are lots of dependencies and opportunities to try and compress certain items (such as the fabrication and testing of that automation machine in row 3) We have weekly conferences on how to expedite certain aspects of the schedule without risking reliability or build quality. Link to Gantt chart The TL;DR There is still a good chunk of work to be done and it looks like the watches will ship around the last week of April. A version of this detailed schedule is being used by Flextronics to make sure deadlines don’t slip further, and we’re doing what we can to compress things as much as possible. The one gating item is the fabrication of the machine that encapsulates all the electronics, We are focusing efforts to speed this up as much as possible. We’re working on how many can be produced and shipped per week, This is expected to be in the region of 1,000 per week, possibly more if we can run 3 shifts per day. This Coming Month of Activities - While one of the machines is being assembled overseas Jerry and I have made a prototype version so we can continue with all other parts of the schedule. - Getting into the water resistance testing facility and running tests. - Drop testing the consumer packaging. This month, like every one previous, is looking like one with very little time for sleep. -Dave, Jerry &amp; the CST team FAQ We’ve been getting a lot of similar questions, so we’ll be publishing a FAQ at the bottom of our updates in order to answer the majority of questions we receive. When will you be shipping? Please read the above update for details on a shipping schedule, it is expected to be the last week of April, What order will you be sending out watches? Can I get mine first? Rewards will be sent out in the order they were received. This is the only fair way to schedule it. We’re doing everything we can to get them out as soon as possible. Has the survey gone out yet? Yes. If you need to change your address, size or color, please send us a message through the kickstarter system (please do not post comments about it) I would like to change my color to... See above How can I change my shipping address? See above Using the size chart, my wrist is just barely inside of (one size) and barely outside of (another size), which size do I choose? Using the size chart, you should choose the size where the band is inside the "size range" square (not outside). There’s no overlap in the sizing chart, and no space between sizes, so you should be inside of one of the areas. If it's really right on the line, and you don't know what to choose, we recommend the smaller size since the bands can be spread out slightly to accommodate larger wrists easier than they can be made smaller. I'm a distributor/reseller/vlogger and would like a sample for… Production samples are not ready yet. The DVUs we do have are not final parts and are not ready for evaluation by suppliers or testers. Where can I buy one? / I just found out about this Kickstarter and still want to pre-order one. / I would like to order additional colors. We’re still in the process of producing the CST-01, so they’re not shipping currently. If you’re interested in getting your name on the list for when we do ship, you can pre-order watches on our site: centralstandardtiming.com . Orders will be fulfilled in the order they were placed. Thanks for the interest! I see that there’s one watch left at the $99 level, how do I get that one? The Kickstarter campaign has ended. That statement is a bug in the Kickstarter system that we’ve requested to have removed. We’ve been told that removing this statement is not possible, so you’ll just need to take our word that the campaign is over and there are no "early bird" rewards left. However, we’re still taking pre-orders on our site: centralstandardtiming.com . Titanium Bands This is something we’re pretty excited about. The stainless steel band was performing well, but we thought we could improve upon it. We tested titanium in parallel with stainless steel and concluded it’s worth the money to upgrade to this far superior material. The Details: Weight: The entire watch assembly is nearly half the weight of the original: our previous weight of 12.5g has been reduced to 6.6g with the titanium band. As far as we can tell, this means the CST-01 will be the world’s lightest watch, as well as the world’s thinnest. It’s so light that a helium balloon can carry it! The watch on the left is one of the old prototypes with the steel band, the watch on the right is one of the new titanium samples: Material Properties: Titanium has better "spring back,” (low elastic modulus) so it better keeps to its original, intended form after repeatedly wearing and removing the watch from your wrist. It is also less stiff, meaning it will be more compliant and comfortable when wearing. Biocompatible: We are using “grade 5 titanium” (Ti6Al4V), which is extremely biocompatible. Those of you who were concerned about nickel allergies need not worry, as there is no nickel in the Titanium alloy we will be using. It’s the same alloy used in biomedical implants. Badass: Grade 5 titanium is the stuff used on space shuttles, fighter jets, and satellites. Manufacturing Titanium: Titanium’s manufacturing properties have made the decision even easier. Titanium can be formed using ALL the same processes as stainless steel and does not incur any schedule slip. In fact, we have more forming and heat treating options available to us. Flextronics is working on forming tools at this very moment. Even the pre-production models we have feel incredible. They are so unbelievably light. Brushed finish, PVD Coating: All models will have the same brushed finish. For the Nando Rossi and the Rose Gold editions, PVD coating works the same way as on titanium as stainless steel. (We’re waiting on brushed samples at the moment.) All in all, we thought it was worth the extra cost for all the above benefits. It’s undeniably better in all categories. Certification In parallel with our work with Flextronics on the mass production units, we’re also been making samples of the watch and the base station for FCC, CE and other necessary certification for us to be able to ship worldwide. These samples are for electrostatic discharge (ESD) testing (what happens when the watch and base station are exposed to incredibly high electric shocks), electromagnetic radiation emitted, and capacity to receive electromagnetic radiation. The samples passed these tests with flying colors. A 4kV discharge does absolutely nothing to the watch or base station, 8kV resets the watch but causes no damage, and the watch emits basically no RF, which is not surprising given that it uses such a small amount of power and has no wireless capability. We will have no problem getting the required certification once the results are written up and submitted for approval. Here’s a short video of those certification samples, the watch and base station changing time and going from 12-hour mode to 24-hour mode. This video shows the final method for setting the time also: We did our tests at the Bay Area Compliance Lab. The anechoic chamber where the RF tests were done is completely sci-fi and incredible: Sleepy Face Low Battery Indicator We had fun coming up with an animation to communicate when the watch runs out of power. You will see this after a month of use if you let the battery drain all the way. Utilizing the segments available, we managed to create a pretty unique indicator: Revised Shipping Schedule We were hoping to start shipping the first batch of watches in late December, but now it looks like it will be late January before we could start shipping units. We are balancing the desire to ship as quickly as possible with the requirement that these watches will be robust and keep ticking when after being put through the paces. We will not sacrifice testing to get these out, and sometimes testing requires unforeseen refinement phases to address issues. We know you want your rewards and we are doing everything we can to get them to you and have them be the best they can be. We are working with Flextronics to outline another detailed plan based on what we know now and will get it out to you as a mini-update as soon as it's complete. Challenges Overcome We estimated about 3 weeks for getting these models ready for CE and FCC testing in the last update. In parallel we were running our own electrical and hardware tests as we assembled those samples, These two items ended up taking about 3.5 weeks. The E Ink displays function as planned, with only one detail that required refinement in the battery-installation process. We were hoping that everything would be perfect, but were relieved that only one area required tweaking to get to best performance. Those adjustments will get us a better performance in water resistance, something we know is a question from our backers. We improved the geometry slightly and adjusted adhesives and assembly steps to better protect the battery from the elements. Once we got it right, it was bomb-proof in our initial tests. Check out his test where we threw a prototype from 12 feet high onto a concrete floor. (Although we are testing to these extreme conditions, please do not do these types of things to your watch!) Here's another where we're bending it in a manner we do not recommend: The physical adjustments were all released in CAD to Flextronics for the base station tooling and have been updated as of a week ago. This adjustment may have made an impact on tooling release: about 2 weeks. We’ll be working with Flextronics to do all we can to expedite the next stage of the process, assembly line strategy is complex, and we’re asking a lot, there are so many new techniques and manufacturing processes in the CST-01 that it will require continued hard work. We’ll be continuing to have lengthy working sessions as we build this out and transfer some responsibilities over to Flextronics. Component Delivery Batteries: Our custom batteries are arriving in a timely manner and are on schedule. We’re very happy to see their production is very much on target. Base Station Electronics: All PCBs and components are on schedule with no delivery issues. E Ink Sub-Assemblies: E Ink wanted to add a few weeks on their end for additional quality control and testing. We were expecting a batch of sub-assemblies by December 7. Now, the new delivery date is December 23-25. This puts us in a little bit of downtime as factories close down for Christmas, but we need to make sure these boards are perfect before the full order comes because there is no room for a mistake. This Coming Month of Activities - Over the next 2-3 weeks, we’ll be working closely with Flextronics on assembly-line design and delivery schedules. - We’ll be sending out the reward survey shortly so that we can get all sizes, color, and delivery information from our backers. - Finalizing the packaging design for shipping. This month is going to be a busy one! Dave, Jerry &amp; the CST team FAQ We’ve been getting a lot of similar questions, so we’ll be publishing a FAQ at the bottom of our updates in order to answer the majority of questions we receive. Will you still be shipping in September? No. Our current schedule shows we’ll start to ship in late January. What order will you be sending out watches? Can I get mine first? Rewards will be sent out in the order they were received. This is the only fair way to schedule it. We’re doing everything we can to get them out as soon as possible. Has the survey gone out yet? Not yet. In the survey, you’ll be able to select your size(s), color(s), and submit your shipping information. We’re only allowed to send one survey, and as these types of data change every once in a while, we’re waiting until we absolutely need this info before sending you the survey. We’ll do everything we can to make sure you don't miss it, and we’ll post in the comments and issue an update when it does go out.

Thanks for the interest! I see that there’s one watch left at the $99 level, how do I get that one? The Kickstarter campaign has ended. That statement is a bug in the Kickstarter system that we’ve requested to have removed. We’ve been told that removing this statement is not possible, so you’ll just need to take our word that the campaign is over and there are no "early bird" rewards left. However, we’re still taking pre-orders on our site: centralstandardtiming.com . First of all, we’d like to thank E Ink for all their hard work to date. We’re excited to announce we received the first 150 fully integrated circuits a week ago! A major milestone to completing delivery of these watches to our backers. We’ve spent all week testing these circuits and everything is looking good. All the segments are behaving correctly and the circuitry is behaving as expected. We’ll continue testing these for a few more days to make sure everything is okay before we pull the trigger on the final production line. Flextronics is advising us on top-priority testing procedures. (A looong list of tests for at least 75 of these units means gallons of Red Bull and coffee are in our near future.) It’s an important and nerve-wracking activity: we have to be sure the circuits are perfect, as there’s no going back from this point. We’ve fabricated a programming head to run these tests while Flextronics works on the mass-production solution for programming all the watches. Mechanically Testing the Circuit The circuits passed our first test with flying colors: they’re dimensionally accurate! Approximately 0.425mm maximum thickness. The perfect size for the world’s thinnest watch. In parallel to all the electrical tests we’re performing on the circuits, we’re also doing mechanical tests on them. We’re making sure the circuits still work when bent and applied onto the band, and we’re confirming that when we do trim the circuits to different sizes, it doesn’t damage any of the components. In the image below, you’ll see a flexible circuit trimmed to the smallest size with a newly formed “small” band in the background. Base Station Development We’re well into tooling and assembly-strategy reviews with Flextronics. We also have initial injection-mold tooling drawings. It’s been a challenging month with many rounds of revisions to ensure a really robust enclosure. But, after all that work, we’re poised to meet the final tooling-release deadline we’ve set for ourselves: about a week from now. (A small victory.) After testing the last iteration of the base station over an extended period of time, it became clear that we needed to refine the mechanism to get a good, reliable connection to the watch itself while not damaging the connector. We now have that final, refined, mechanical architecture that gives great electrical contact to the watch when charging and changing the time. The latest iteration of the base station has a completely custom mechanism inside. When the watch is inserted, a small plastic part rotates into place to hit the charging contacts accurately. Because the connectors are rotated into place, there’s no risk of scraping past the connectors and damaging them. We’ve managed to do this while still retaining the small package (about 20% the size of the original charger). Here’s an image of the initial injection-mold tool drawings. This is for the main part of the Base Station—it’s a complicated tool. :) This part is injection molded first, then the tool swings out to another platen to begin the rubber overmolding process. The purple, blue, and orange sections show parts of the tool that slide to mold button details, USB details, and a window for CE and FCC labelling. All the plastic parts have to be analyzed for plastic mold flow. Here’s an example of one type of analysis for the top plastic part: This Coming Month of Activities We’ll be spending all our waking hours this month getting the above parts fabricated and assembled so that we can embark on certification testing. Making all the parts, assembling them, and testing them should take about 2-3 weeks, which leads us into accelerated wear, thermal, moisture, ESD, CE, FCC testing, which takes another 3-4 weeks. We have printed circuit boards for the Base Station arriving this week and next, so we’re on plan for this build phase. It’s important we pass all these tests so we can ship worldwide and we are confident our product will perform well. This month is going to be a busy one… :) On a Less Technical Note: CST is Now Our Full-Time Job On a recent call with E Ink, the team was surprised to discover we’re doing CST full time now: all day, every day. And it struck us that even with all the updates, we hadn’t told any of you either! Our bad. We left our jobs at IDEO about 6 months ago. We had to: the design and development of the CST-01 is requiring our full attention. We want you all to know that we’re fully committed to this and only this right now. Our job is to deliver high-quality watches. Period. Okay, that’s about all for now. Thanks again to all our backers and thanks for reading this mini update.. We’re expecting more parts of the puzzle to arrive over the next few weeks, and we’ll share pictures when we have them, in the style of mini updates like this one.

However, we’re still taking pre-orders on our site: centralstandardtiming.com . Last week we began a trip to California to work closely with our assembly partner, Flextronics, for 30 days. Our goal is that relocation will allow us to accelerate development and arrive on the highest quality solutions together. It looks like all the CST-01s for our Kickstarter backers will be manufactured in the USA with the help of Flextronics International. We had a goal to make these in the USA, we’re excited to have got so much closer to that goal this month. Flextronics are incredibly experienced in all areas of supply chain management, manufacturing and fulfillment, We’re very excited to have such a prestigious partner on board to deliver these rewards. They’re kind of a big deal and this certainly makes us more confident we’re moving toward delivering the best quality product we can. Here’s a picture of us with the core team after a recent development meeting. Project plan and schedule We’re really excited about what could be interpreted as completely boring. All partners and supply chain are on schedule as planned, We’ll keep updating this project plan as we collaborate with Flextronics this month. Anyhow, details on all the parts: 1. Battery samples delivered. 400 parts arrived and we’re currently using these for testing, the delivery schedule for the rest of our batteries is still on schedule too. 2. Battery Management IC delivered. We received 400 of these units this week and ship them directly to our flexible printed circuit partner for testing. Full delivery of all these ICs is the 16th of September. 3. Flexible circuit with e-ink display on schedule. A sample set of the fully integrated watch circuit is scheduled for delivery on October 9th for testing, we are working on ways to expedite this to reduce timelines. After some testing we can turn the key and manufacture 10,000 circuit boards. And here’s the project plan with where we are to date: A much larger and more readable chart Activities this past month Base Station We have these parts more ready for injection molding, the main parts all have the required 1 degree of tooling draft, two of the parts need a ‘slide’ in the tool for details that cannot be molded straight (the USB hole and the button levers. will have a sliding part of the tool to mold these features.) The 3D printed iterations this month are working well and we are ready to do some CNC machined parts. This will enable us to test the resulting in the force needed on those connectors, we can also do repetitive tests on the connector. With these models and test results in hand should be armed with the knowledge we need to make any needed engineering changes to the tool and assembly to have the work repeatably and reliably. The most challenging part of the base station is getting good force and contact between the watch charge point and the connector in the base station….and doing all that while ensuring it ‘feels’ secure when you slide the watch in and out. Here’s a cross section view through the parts picture above when assembled.. Bridging the time until we receive our final flexible circuits. As you can see from the timeline we do not receive the final flexible circuit with e-ink display for about a month. So as to not waste time we released a prototype flexible board that we can attach to our previous prototypes so that we can continue mold testing, mechanical and electrical testing. September To-Do List - Test a physical model of the base station and charger to ensure good mechanical and electrical performance. - Design refinements based on the results of the base station tests and further refinements for moldflow in injection molding. - Create some test fixtures for the flexible circuit so we can refine molding strategies while we wait on delivery of our real FPC in October to continue more testing. - Continue packaging design and engineering development. What’s the Status of the Budget? We’ve had very little expenditure this last month, The wedge moved a little due to ordering some crystals and having them delivered to our FPC partner, plus some small prototyping cost for the base station and the bridge flex circuit. We’re on track!

We are still in the process of producing the CST-01 so they are not shipping currently. If you are interested in getting your name on the list for when we do ship you can pre-order watches on our site: centralstandardtiming.com . Orders will be fulfilled in the order they were placed. Thanks for the interest! I see that there is one watch left at the $99 level, how do I get that one? The Kickstarter campaign has ended. That statement is a bug in the Kickstarter system that we have requested to have removed. We have been told that removing this statement is not possible, so you will just need to take our word that the campaign is over and there are no "early bird" rewards left. However, we are still taking pre-orders on our site at centralstandardtiming.com . (TL;DR: It looks like the watch will ship December - January.) It’s been a busy six weeks here at CST. We’ve been concentrating on four main things: 1. Finalizing a completely new battery solution. We’re no longer able to procure THINERGY batteries. These were a vital part of our system but, unfortunately, the manufacturer is no longer producing them. We’ve worked hard to find a new battery that has similar characteristics and that passes our electrical, capacity, and flexibility tests. This has been the primary pain point concerning scheduling, but we have secured the delivery schedule of a new battery solution that meets our challenging specifications. 2. Developing and purchasing a custom “Battery Management IC” that is within our thickness limitations. Stock parts were outside our needed specifications, so we needed to specify a custom solution (with an associated longer lead time). 3. Purchasing all other long lead-time components 4. Minimizing delivery impact to backers. We’ve managed to compress the production of the custom components mentioned above, but we are still looking at an estimated delivery window of the watch to backers from December 2013 through January 2014. (there’s a lot more detail on this later on in the post). We thought it was best to make sure all delivery times were stable before doing a Kickstarter update, as some of these delivery times were still shifting as recently as last week. We want this to be the ONLY update like this we have to do. New Battery Solution Battery Status: We finalized all necessary tests and delivered payment for 10,000 batteries on June 15. We are getting these batteries as fast as our manufacturer can provide them to us. The first 400 battery samples arrive in 3-4 weeks. We can use these to continue on our path to pre-production units while waiting on the delivery of final production batteries. Our partner is ramping up production early for us and will be delivering batteries on a staggered schedule so we can keep assembling units at a good pace. (Delivery dates are shown in the project plan later on in this post.) Battery Management IC Production: Sometimes the smallest things are the most important. The tiny Battery Management IC, a critical part of the watch’s electronics, has taken quite some time to nail down in terms of details and development times. We’ve ordered and paid for a custom silicon wafer in order to meet our thickness and performance requirements. The minimum order for these parts is 18,000 units. We placed the order on June 3, and are well into production of these units. Manufacturing this type of custom wafer and IC takes about 14 weeks. For such a physically tiny part, it’s playing an incredibly important role. It protects the watch from damage due to over-discharge, while the associated circuitry protects the charging and data ports, which in turn protect the watch from moisture damage. It also helps us know when the battery is charged, so we can have a reliable signal to tell you when it’s topped off. Wafer dicing Redesigned and Integrated Display Circuit: We have defined and placed the order for a completely revised integrated flex circuit for the display. All components are now to be assembled on one flexible circuit board, rather than laminating multiple layers, as shown in our Kickstarter prototype. The benefit of this approach is that we have fewer layers of adhesive resulting in mechanical reliability and a thinner overall size. Automated Assembly Work: We have evolved our manufacturing strategy to ensure all electronics are sealed against moisture. This required us to rethink and adjust the way the watch would be assembled and will result in a higher-quality assembly. Current progress on subassembly Continuing to Work on Charging and Data Port Details: We have also further refined the details of the charging and data port. The inclusion of an anisotropic silicone layer will protect the watch even further from moisture. It will raise the level of the contact area by 0.5mm to reduce mechanical wear and ensure a good connection when placed in the charger. It also hides the previously exposed contacts, giving the watch a cleaner appearance. What’s the Status of the Project Timeline? We’ve spent a lot of time focusing on working around “dependencies” in the project timeline for the last 4-6 weeks. These dependencies are things like: Populating our boards depends on all the electrical components being at the assembly house, or the glue needs to be at the factory before we can test assembly to the bands on actual equipment. We identified the areas that cause delays and focused on addressing those issues first and foremost. Not being able to use our original battery, and having to qualify a new solution that has a much longer lead-time has certainly impacted our timeline. Other Developments: The good news is there’s plenty of work to do that is not reliant on delivery of these components, so now we can refocus and continue to develop our design while waiting for delivery. If you crave the details, below is a link to our project plan with all our dependencies shown: (click here to get a much larger JPEG) What’s the Status of the Budget? Despite the increased costs of the new battery solution and the Battery Management IC, we’re on track to use our backing money carefully where it’s needed to buy components and pay for mold tools, assembly packaging, and everything else. At this point, we’re more thankful than ever for our backers. You are making it possible for us to get the CST-01 out into the world. Activities for the Next Month As you can probably tell from the update, our last month or so was all about supply-chain management and getting all partners synchronized around production and delivery. We also focused on getting the most challenging parts of the watch—the flexible circuit—further toward delivery with continued engineering development and revisions with our partner. We’ll still be dealing with all the above on a daily basis. August To-Do List: - Further develop the mechanics and automation for both the watch and the Base Station. - Adjust details on the watch’s metal band to relieve stress in certain areas and to increase longevity during repeated bending. - Tweak the Base Station for injection molding and assembly, as well as PCB development and production. - Conduct on-site plant visits to assess current automation offerings and repurpose them to meet our specific needs. Again, thank you all so much for the support! This last six weeks has been tough, but we’re motivated by having worked through these challenges and by having your continued support. Cheers, Dave, Jerry &amp; the CST team We’ve been especially busy this month meeting with many possible partners and having to redesign certain parts for those partner’s capabilities. We’re also having to create and develop some new methods of assembly for specific automation platforms. Our Design Validation Units on Display at the New Museum: If you head over to the New Museum in NYC, you can see a couple of our design validation units on display at their Adhocracy exhibition . This runs for another month. Check it out! Battery Status: We are looking to move to a different battery supplier, We had to work through some challenging mechanical issues and design a new way of bend testing. We have a couple of options for different battery suppliers, and the specifications are very similar to the Thinergy cell we were previously evaluating. The good news is that with all the possible design tweaks we’re getting promising results of over 1800 extreme bend cycles from almost flat to the radius of the small band. We will likely be placing our orders for batteries and battery management ICs this week in order to prevent delays in fulfillment. Watch Assembly: Many factors have pointed us to make a much better watch assembly. We’ve got new directions that overcome challenges on surface levelling, water resistance and creating a much more rigorous assembly to protect the battery and other components. We are in negotiations with several partners that have the machinery to automate this process AND we have been prototyping a ‘proof of concept’ molding assembly, right here in our shop, to bring with us to these meetings. We have been using specialty adhesives, casting materials and a molding jig that we expose in our UV curing chamber for these rough tests. New Base Station and Charging Port: While working out details around assembly and water resistance, we have simplified the stainless steel band. There are no holes on the back anymore and a sub-assembly will be sealed before it is adhered to the band. We have moved the charging and data points to the front surface where we can control water ingress. Because of our battery management circuitry, if these exposed contacts are bridged (e.g. dipping it in water), there is no appreciable current draw from the battery. By going this route, we will have much better water resistance than the previous design could. The above watch refinements mean we have had the opportunity to address a much better option for the base station. One that works with all sizes and is small enough to travel with conveniently. A “travel charger” was a much-requested optional accessory, but instead of doing that, we decided to revisit the base station to make it more travel-friendly for everyone. The result is a base station that gives the illusion the watch can almost levitate, highlighting it’s incredible low weight and thinness even more so than the previous design. In short, there are a number of reasons that this change was the right thing to do. The world’s thinnest watch needed to be paired with an equally unobtrusive base station. Although we were fond of the knob interaction for setting the time on the previous design, there is no question that the newer design is superior. We’re currently adding molding details to that charger and expect a higher fidelity ‘prototype within a few weeks. FAQ We have been getting a lot of similar questions so we will be publishing a FAQ at the bottom of our updates in order to answer the majority of questions we receive. Has the survey gone out yet? Not yet. In the survey you will be able to select your size(s), color(s), and submit your shipping information.

See above How can I change my shipping address? See above Using the size chart, my wrist is just barely inside of (one size) and barely outside of (another size), which size do I choose? Using the size chart, you should choose the size where the band is inside the "size range" square (not outside). There is no overlap in the sizing chart, and so space between sizes so you should be inside of one of the areas. If it's really right on the line and you don't know what to choose, we'd recommend the smaller size since the bands can be spread out slightly to accomidate larger wrists easier than they can be made smaller. Before we send the survey we will release a simpler final sizing chart, so please do not fret too much about the sizing details right now as they might change slightly.

Thanks for the interest! I see that there is one watch left at the $99 level, how do I get that one? The Kickstarter campaign has ended. That statement is a bug in the Kickstarter system that we have requested to have removed. We have been told that removing this statement is not possible, so you will just need to take our word that the campaign is over and there are no "early bird" rewards left. However, we are still taking pre-orders on our site at centralstandardtiming.com . Hello everyone, We have been hard at work and have a big update for you. Working Full Time: We are now in our third week of working full time on the CST-01. We now have an office within IDEO Chicago set up as Central Standard HQ. Sizes and metal forming: We got the next round of size revisions in stainless steel from small to large and are working on refining these further. Here's a picture of them inside our "tolerance-checking-jig" Battery Management IC / Water Resistance Progress: We are adding circuitry to the watch that will make it much more robust. What this does is allow us to charge the watch with a power source anywhere between 5 and 20V. It also protects the watch from short-circuiting. Bridging the charging contacts with metal, water, sweat etc. will not do any adverse damage or discharge the battery. Because the watch is so thin we cannot use conventionally packaged ICs (integrated circuits), we have to get full silicon wafers processed specifically to yield parts thin enough. We are currently navigating this process for our battery protection. Battery Life We have been testing the battery life with our new battery management circuitry in place. The test started on 3/27 and the watch is still ticking 26 days later. It looks like we can still hit our one month battery-life target! Display and general electronics refinement: We’ve been working on further integration of the display module, battery management chip, Epson SOC into one subassembly to increase reliability and simplicity of the entire system. Manufacturer Visits This coming week we will be visiting manufacturers with facilities in the US. These visits will help us finalize our partner selection, and allow us to design for specific assembly processes.

That statement is a bug in the Kickstarter system that we have requested to have removed. We have been told that removing this statement is not possible, so you will just need to take our word that the campaign is over and there are no "early bird" rewards left. However, we are still taking pre-orders on our site at centralstandardtiming.com . Firstly, we want to thank all of the backers who helped us raise funds for this project. Completing at over $1M and 5 times our original goal, we are deeply thankful for all of your support. Because of the enthusiastic support, we have enough funding to have our pick of the best assembly partners and component suppliers to make the watch as good as it can possibly be. We would also like to announce that we have added the ability to pre-order watches and base stations directly from our website: centralstandardtiming.com . Pre-ordering reserves your spot in line for the order in which we ship after our Kickstarter backers receive their watches. It will also help us know how many additional watches of various colors and sizes to produce. We are not charging people for pre-orders at this time, but will be sending out e-mails once product is ready to ship to finalize the transactions. For people who have already backed us on Kickstarter: If the pledge level you backed us at included a CST-01 as a reward, you do not need to also pre-order unless you want to reserve additional watches and/or base stations. Also, the Kickstarter reward watches will be shipped before any of these pre-order units will, so you'll still be among the first people to have a CST-01. Thanks Everyone! -The Central Standard Timing Team We have less than 3 days left on the clock so we wrapped up some things we wanted to update you with before the campaign ends. Background Story We put together a history of the design of the CST-01 from early CAD sketches to the fully working design validation units shown in the Kickstarter video and at CES. This evolution is illustrated with a ton of process photos and renderings from throughout the design process. It's way more than we could fit in an update. Check it out: <url>"Nando Rossi Edition" (CST-01NR) and the "Rose Gold Edition" (CST-01RG) . The Nando Rossi Edition has a black mask on a black PVD coated stainless steel band, and the CST-01RG has a black mask on a PVD coated rose gold colored stainless steel band (not gold plated). About the PVD coating: PVD stands for "physical vapor deposition". The watch bands are put in a vacuum and an electric charge is applied to band, this charge attracts a coating compound comprised of various elements to settle and coat the metal band. The coating won't wear off, in fact it can actually protect the metal from wear. PVD coatings are used throughout the wristwatch industry and are also used as a protective layer on machine tools, as well as high-end automotive engine components. The coating still allows the reflective metal color and texture to be seen, so the final look retains the quality look of the metal with the desired color. How do I change my reward to get one of these new colors? As a sign of our gratitude for the amazing support you all have shown us, we are offering these colors at no additional price. To change your reward, go back to the home page of the project: <url>"Manage Your Pledge" on the right. You can then choose one of the new tiers. A survey will also go out after the campaign ends that will ask you to confirm the color you selected, although we do ask that you manage your pledge if possible so we can most accurately gauge the amount of coated bands we will need to produce. What's Nando Rossi have to do with this? After looking into PVD processes, Jerry was rendering a black-on-black version of the CST-01. That night one of our Facebook followers named Nando Rossi suggested that we do the same black-on-black version. Jerry had it rendering already so that night he posted it on Facebook and called it the "Nando Rossi Edition." Now, before our Facebook feed gets clogged with more color requests, ask yourself this: "Is my name as cool as Nando Rossi's?" Why did you wait so long to add these colors after posting them to Facebook? Kickstarter does not allow renderings anymore, and this is actually a fantastic policy. We wanted to have the actual bands coated, inspect them, and see how they look before offering them to our backers. Enjoy! -The Central Standard Team Hello, We just got a message from Kickstarter about this reward tier. It is apparently in violation of their guideline that prohibits rewards of multiples. Although we thought this reward tier qualified as a "sensible set", which is allowed, Kickstarter's definition is that "...offering the same item in two different colors does not [qualify], regardless of how many chargers you're offering along with them." SO... what we need to ask is that any of you who chose this level please choose a different reward level as soon as you can. Kickstarter has removed us from their search and browse functionality until this is complete (which will impact our backing rate significantly). We need every single backer at this reward tier to change his/her reward before we can comply to their request and become "findable" again. To do this, please go to our page at: <url>"manage reward". Inside of that menu, you can change your reward level to one of the single-unit (black or white) rewards instead. We apologize for the confusion and the hassle that this has caused, and will appreciate your help in resolving this. Best, The Central Standard Timing Team Hello everyone, We are getting ready to do our next batch of prototypes. These will take into account a few revisions from what you have seen. 1: The main difference is sizing. The current model was a medium, we are forming a small and a large as well. The small has been optimized for a minimum circumference wrist based on the length of the embedded components as well as width, height and circumference of a 5th Percentile female's wrist. We're also adjusting the geometry to be flatter across the wrist top. The bend Radii of the small needs to be test assembled in order to see whether the components operate at this tight curvature. The medium has also been adjusted to be flatter through the wrist top, slight circumference adjustment and we're widened the gap in the band to allow for easier wearing and removal. The large is designed to accommodate a 95th Percentile male (we expect that this may need more refinement as we go forward) This has been adjusted to be flatter through the wrist top and we've increased the gap in this size to allow easier wearing and removal. 2: Color Matching: We are revising our paint selection to dial in the color matching even further on the top mask. 3: Band Thickness: We are going to make a thicker metal band (from 0.7mm to 0.89mm) with a deeper pocket (at 0.70mm) so the entire assembly sits inside the pocket with nothing sticking out. For those of you interested in sizing, attached is our chart for our three sizes. This is preliminary and should not be assumed to be final. It is simply our first attempt at getting the sizing right. There are circumference ranges associated with each size. The units will ship as the smallest size in this range and can be opened up to anywhere in the range by pulling on the ends of the band and testing it until comfortable. Here are some screengrabs of the sizes and attached is an image that you can print and cut out the sizes to try on yourself. There should be a gap between the edges of the watch on your wrist, so when you try on the paper watches, the correct one for you will be the one where one edge of the watch lies inside of the "size range" box on the other side. Make sure the image doesn't scale when you print. I can't attach a PDF but here's a link to the PDF if the image is printing incorrectly: <url>"this is such a weird request, he'll be into it". He replied "Absolutely not" and then just walked away. SO then I went over to the big cineplex because it was 6 dollar movie night anyway and got a ticket to the next showing: Zero Dark Thirty. I walked into Django Unchained and the results are this: It totally depends on the amount of light in the scene. Night scenes, forget about it, I couldn't read it at all. During outdoor day scenes it was readable (shown), but definitely less than anywhere else I tested. Don't Count on It. There you go. We think that it satisfies most conditions satisfactorily but you can't count on it in the movies or in places like a dark bedroom. Bars, restaurants, nightclubs, sidewalks, etc. are no problem. Now, obviously, the fact that my camera (Sony RX-100) was able to capture the image doesn't mean the the eye can. I'd even say the photos appear slightly bright, but I didn't doctor them aside from putting them side-by-side and I am being honest on readability. Hope this helps clear some questions up! -Dave We doubled our goal! Thank you to everyone. We just doubled our goal within a week and can't express enough thanks for your ongoing support. We have some more answers to some of the questions you have. Multiples We checked with Kickstarter and they confirmed that we cannot advertise to encourage backers to multiply their pledge to receive multiples. "offering multiple quantities of a reward that doesn't exist yet sets the wrong expectation for what backing a project is all about." Post-Funding Plan As an alternative, Kickstarter encouraged us to outline our post-funding plan. We will be taking pre-orders for the same $129 price on our website: centralstandardtiming.com We will give you adequate time to pre-order after the campaign ends, then send a survey out to all the backers. We will group the orders to get you the watches earlier as the kickstarter backers will get their watches first (and to save on shipping). Fonts We are not allowed to modify our reward text now, but the fonts will go out to all backers at the $5 or above goals. Thanks for the interest! We would like to thank all of the backers so far. Your support has been incredible! Now that we are funded, we are fortunate enough to have more of a head-start getting the CST-01 ready for production. We are now back from CES in Las Vegas and want to take some time to answer a number of of questions from the comments: Multiples: Kickstarter's new guidelines prohibit selling multiples of a product as "The development of new products can be especially complex for creators and offering multiple quantities feels premature, and can imply that products are shrink-wrapped and ready to ship." We have reached out to Kickstarter for how best to respond to your requests, but for the time being, it looks like we can only fulfill one reward per Kickstarter account. When we hear back from Kickstarter, we will post another update. However, we can provide "sensible sets" so we added a reward that only has one base station, but both colors of watches for the person who wants to be able to have the choice, or for those who can share a charger. Those of you who have already backed can "edit your pledge" to the new set. Travel Charger: We are listening to you and investigating what a travel charger would entail. We may be able to come up with something that is sufficiently smaller than the base station to make it worthwhile. Stay tuned for further updates on its development.
