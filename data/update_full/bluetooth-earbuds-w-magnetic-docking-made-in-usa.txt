I just want to let everyone know that I'm still working on this, literally, every day. As you know, Elroy is a project that can't be completed. Development costs ended up exceeding the KS funding and it would have required additional venture backing to complete the project. But no venture capital is going to back a product that cost more to produce than the retail price of competing products on the market. That's just a reality that can't be overcome. In the business world this is not that unusual. Investors might put money into 10 ventures with the expectation that one will actually flourish and make up for the losses of all the others. But Kickstarter occupies a world between venture and normal commerce. There is a popular book out these days called The Lean Startup . In that book they discuss the idea of the "pivot." Startups inherently operate in a risky environment, and sometimes even very good ideas just don't get to a minimum viable product (MVP) state. And that's pretty much sums up what's happened with Elroy. When you get to that point they suggest what you do is pivot. You look at new ideas and new approaches. You reassess. You take what you've learned and move forward. (One very successful pivot is Groupon.) This is what I'm in the middle of doing right now. I've very close to funding a new product. But it would be highly inappropriate for me to be making updates about what's happening with regards to that. I take my responsibility to all the Elroy backers very seriously, but you need to realize that raising capital is a very slow process. Once I complete this fundraising process I have something special to offer all of you that I think many, or even most, of you will be very pleased by. I just can't announce anything quite yet. Hang in there. We're getting close. Rob I need to do an update to respond to one specific backer who has publicly accused me of fraud in relation to this project. Steve McMahon (@stevemcmahon40) has written a blog post making this accusation and has been harassing Timbuk2 on their twitter account. I would encourage anyone interested to go through and read his full twitter feed over the past few days. I do not know how many other folks here agree with his interpretation but I’d like to make a few comments. 1) Fraud would require some form of personal enrichment. This has been exactly the opposite with the Elroy project. This project, unexpectedly, cost a great deal of money beyond the KS fundraise. And as explained in a previous update, additional fund raising was not possible primarily due to a) my lack of a background in consumer electronics, and b) Sony selling some very nice, very well engineered bluetooth units that are similar and retail for less than I can have Elroy produced for in China. 2) Timbuk2 is a company I sold in 2005. There is no relationship between what I’m doing now and Timbuk2. Harassing them doesn't make much logical sense. 3) I am continuing to work on everyone’s refund, but I do not have an update on when I will be able to start issuing those. When refunds start to issue I will post an update to that fact. 4) I fully admit that I have not been responding to daily emails asking for an update on when refunds will be issued. I don’t have a staff that fields responses, and I am trying to remain focused on doing the work I need to do that will result in issuing refunds. 5) I have discussed this situation with people at Kickstarter and they state are merely the platform for fundraising and do not take a position outside of that. They did, though, highly suggest an update, which I'm doing here. What I will tell everyone is, I am working on a new business – one that is much closer to my manufacturing skill set, and one which I believe will be successful. I’m extremely excited about it but, as of yet, can’t discuss what it is. I realize that’s not much consolation under the current circumstances. Again, I’m not trying to “duck out” of my responsibility here. In fact, I take that responsibility very seriously. All I can do at the moment is to continue to ask for your patience. I’m a very hard worker and I’m going to get this done. Sincerely, Rob Honeycutt Again, this is Update Lite™ I know these are a little tedious, but folks were requesting that I continue with weekly updates. I'm continuing to work on several new sources of funding to finish off this project. It would be great to give a firm date on when this would come through, but that's just not how the funding world works. Funding happens when it happens, and it's really hard to predict. I appreciate the offers I've had from folks with ideas for additional funding strategies. If you have contacts for prospective investors please feel free to pass those along. At this point there is no assistance needed with engineering or anything product related. Everything else is done. All I'm doing is looking for additional funding to finish production. Everyone's continued patience is greatly appreciated. Best, Rob Another light Monday update Still working on several different deals that would move the project to completion. Once again, it's impossible to know when one of these might break loose. All I can do is push forward as hard as I can. But all I need is for one of these deals to click and then we'll be on our way to completing the project. Thanks! Rob Still working... Not much that I can report at the moment. I'm still moving on several deals that should help get this project wrapped up. Part of the process I'm working on right now is regarding ways to get the final production cost down. I'm pretty confident we'll be able to do that, and that makes it much easier to push this thing across the finish line. I'm going to continue with these Monday updates, even when they're light like this one. Thanks! Gonna try Monday updates again A few of you requested that I continue with weekly updates again, so we're going to give it a shot. These are probably not going to be as satisfying as when we were in full development mode but we'll see how it goes. Depending on the week, some of these may be just reporting that nothing new has happened. Just understand that I'm working on this every day. First, I wanted to share a photo of a completed unit, seeing as I haven't done so in a while. Remember, these are complete in everything except for the final PCBA production and final assembly. I'm very pleased with the results. They look great. They feel great. It's just a nice product. Paths forward I have several paths forward that I'm working on. Of course, these all involve working out financial deals with various people, thus I can't really discuss the particulars of any of them. I know everyone wants to know when . The answer to that question is completely a function of when one of these deals breaks through, and that's just an impossible thing to predict. Still moving forward I need to bring everyone up to speed here on what’s happening in the background. Elroy has started moving much more slowly due to the fact that the costs of development have exceeded the Kickstarter funding. I’ve been working the past few months to try to raise additional funding without success, as of yet. In round figures, here is what it has cost so far… Electrical engineering $90k Mechanical engineering $30k Earbuds and tooling $12k Charger cords and tooling $3k Travel Case $3k Back clip and tooling $3k Plastic external case and tooling $8k RF engineering $2k Prototyping $2k Travel expenses $2k Shipping and duties $5k Again, these are rough figures that total up to $160k, which is about $22k over our KS funding (less KS and Amazon charges). Additional investments We need at least another $65k to get the boards finished, installed and product shipped to backers. That is my immediate and daily job right now. There are a number of paths to success that I’m working on but it’s currently impossible to estimate when this will come through. Bootstrap entrepreneurialism Early on in this project I stated that I believed most KS creators miss an important element to what KS is about. There is an excellent book out by Joe Pine called The Experience Economy that reinforces the idea that I believe KS espouses. KS starter states that they are not a store; KS is about supporting projects. Elroy is about the experience of developing a product. I’ve tried to bring everyone along on this journey of creating an electronics product. And that’s been a lot of fun through the refinement of the external case. It was exciting to have different parts show up and see our illustrations turned into real life parts. The challenges we’ve faced, which are also part of the experience, have primarily been with the engineering. In our early tests and assessments we felt it was going to be very simple process to put the WT32 on a board. As we got further into the project we realized how much more complicated that task was, particularly with regards to the antenna. Our EE has actually done an amazing job, given the challenge presented. All of this is part and parcel to the experience of bootstrapping a new product to bring it to market. This is not even dissimilar from what goes on within larger companies. A product idea will get a development budget, which is invariably going to be tight. There are always miscalculations and budget overruns. There are launch delays (yes, of even more than a year). But consumers usually don’t see these. All you ever see is the product when it launches. You buy a product but never share the experience of development. Tenacity is the key ingredient There is one aspect of being an entrepreneur that is important beyond all others: Tenacity . I could tell you a thousand stories about the early days of Timbuk2 that would make your hair stand on end. Timbuk2 is a successful business because we plowed through ordeals that most people would believe were unsurvivable. This same tenacity is what I’m applying to Elroy. Felix Niland’s petition I need to address here a petition that has been created by Felix requesting refunds. The link to his petition is here: <url>’re shipping we will have a very similar return/refund policy. But Kickstarter is about the project of bring this product to market. Currently I have the following people on my list for a refund. If you’re interested in receiving a refund instead of a product and your name is not on the list below, please feel free to send me an email requesting your name to be added to the list (<email>). Gabriel Del Castillo Steve Calabro James Lipari Eric Ramirez John Driggers Matt Cici Govinder Singh Michael Janelle Edward Lotz Kelly McClung Jason Page Inray Liang Chris Fountas Adrian Chang Dalton Kipp Jin Kim Jennifer Salazar Markus Schmid Okay, you will notice that this is not a "backer only" update. That means... Bluegiga's New Module Has Been Announced Whew! Now I can actually communicate again. Monday I had a minor heart attack because I contacted Bluegiga for an update on when the new module would be announced and was told third week in April. But then they up and unexpectedly announce it yesterday. This is a very big deal for Bluegiga, as you can tell from their website. Bluegiga produces dozens of different bluetooth modules, but this one they've devoted their front page to, and created a ton of support material for. This is a product Bluegiga has devoted a considerable amount of effort to, and I believe everyone is going to be pleased with the results. But first... Meet FrankenRoy. FrankenRoy was a version of the Elroy PCBA (the "a" means "assembly") where we were attempting to isolate the range problem. We lifted the Bluegiga module off the PCB so that we could either move it away or closer to our board, and we could also move it around relative to various components on the board. The result was, almost as expected, when we moved the module away from the board we got full reception. When we moved it near the board, the reception degraded. One of our solutions for this was to remove all the board material below the antenna. You can see in the picture below the area that's been removed. That gold colored "C" shape is the backside of the antenna on the Bluegiga module. This method improved our range slightly, but not a tremendous amount. Enter the WT32i If you remember back, we've been spec'ing the WT32 module from Bluegiga. The WT32i is the new version of that module. The differences are highly significant. One idea that had been put forth as a solution was to embed the vias on our PCB. Vias are those little circles you see all over the surface of a PCB. You can see lots of them on the last image above. Those can be embedded into the board so they don't meet the surface. What this accomplishes is, it helps to isolate the electrical signals going through them from other components. The problem with this solution was, it would double our costs, whereas we're already running a very tight margin on this product as it is. What we couldn't consider (at the time) was embedding vias on the bluetooth module. But that's what Bluegiga has done. On the left (the blue one) is the new WT32i and on the right is the older WT32. Notice the difference? Now you see almost no traces, and you notice the "C" shape is gone as well. In overall architecture, Bluegiga has made a major leap forward here. Another big change on the outside is related to the antenna itself. The old antenna was an older style chip antenna which works in conjunction with the ground plane of the PCB. The new antenna is a ceramic chip , which is a new variant of this technology. The new WT32i is also thinner that the previous version, which is important for us since we have very little room between the faceplate and the shielding face of the Bluegiga. It's just 0.2mm difference, but that's a world of difference in a small package like Elroy. Externally, there is one other difference with the WT32i. They've changed the solder points around the outside edge of their board. For hand mounting the module to our board that was a nice feature, but they've removed that and all the solder pads are now under the board. The solder pads on our PCB design still mate with the new WT32i, so no changes are required to mate, but it just slows down our initial testing processes. Under The Hood On the inside and performance-wise is where we're going to see the biggest differences. I remember some of you were concerned that this project was taking so long that the product was going to be out of date. That would have been the case with the older WT32. The new WT32i is full state-of-the-art. The older WT32 was rated a class 2, for 10 meter bluetooth range. The new unit they're quoting at 50 meter range . The Bluegiga sales rep had quoted me, "Better than double" but it's looking like they're confident of range well beyond that. There was another niggling issue with the old WT32 regarding a faint buzz that we couldn't seem to eliminate. We got it to the point where I could only hear it when no music was playing. They now say that was resident on their board and has been eliminated. We still have some additional testing to do, but I feel very confident that this new module from Bluegiga is going to make Elroy the top notch product I want it to be. Delivery status? Yes, I can hear the chorus of "When do we get it?" Bluegiga literally just announced this yesterday, and as you can see, the sale rep wasn't fully informed about the launch. I think that's an indicator of how tight-lipped they've been about this whole thing. I need to do a little more work to find out when modules can be delivered. And then what sort of time frame we can get all the testing and production scheduled. Right now I can't offer a firm date, but will work on trying to tie that down. - - - - - - - - - - Refunds? We've had about 20-30 people (about 1.5% of the backers) clamoring for a refund. I've not been responding to those requests specifically because I needed to stay out of any conversations that might cause me to reveal too much about Bluegiga's product release. I apologize for that silence but it's been for very important reasons. I've been going back to read up on Kickstarter's rules. The overarching idea is that "Kickstarter is not a store." Kickstarter is about supporting projects. My project is to build a wearable bluetooth device with magnetic attachment points. That project, like a great many KS projects, has unfortunately dragged out far longer than anticipated. But I think it has dragged out for all the right reasons (making sure the product is great) rather than the wrong reasons (the product isn't manufacturable). My responsibility here is to make sure I deliver the product that I presented. For those who've been requesting refunds, when we start delivering product you can make a choice, at that time , as to whether you would prefer the product or a refund check. In the meantime I will maintain a list of those who would like a refund. If you would like to confirm your name is on that list please send me a direct email: <email> Thanks! Rob Hope everyone had a great holiday and is having a great New Year. We're currently still in our holding pattern waiting on news about the bluetooth module. I'm getting back into the swing of things after the holidays and will be following up on a few things. We'll hopefully have more information soon. If any of you are out there in the bitter cold parts of the U.S., please take care. Remember the 30-30-30 rule! A temperature of -30F with 30 mph winds can freeze your skin in 30 seconds. Stay warm. Stay safe. Best, Rob Monday totally slipped by without me even noticing it. 'Tis the season, I guess. We're having a nice family get together here at our house in the period between Xmas and New Years. Suffice to say, there's no new news at the moment. I'll keep everyone posted as soon as something pops. Happy New Year to everyone! Rob Another quiet week. I'm still expecting more information from Bluegiga and will update everyone as soon as that comes available. It's kind of a waiting game at this point. Wishing everyone and their families a great holiday week! Rob We're probably going to have a few "no new news" updates coming here. I'll definitely let everyone know once we have something more definitive to report. Until then, I hope everyone has a very safe and happy holiday season with those you love. Best to all! :-) First Clumsy Assemblies Working through some first run assemblies right now. The first assemblies are always tough since your hands have to learn the process. Here it's about a 4 min process with lots of extraneous and unnecessary movements. I was intending to get a video of the pick-and-place machine populating the PCB's but that's going to have to come later. The side plates, as you can see, are the most troublesome part of the process. I need to come up with a method to hold them in place better while I do the assembly. Once everything is together right it snaps right into place and the buttons work perfectly. Battery News Ran another battery test the other day, and I again got over 6 straight hours playing music. I'm feeling pretty comfortable about that. I hope everyone doesn't mind if I keep this short. I've got a lot of work to do. Quick update today... Not a whole lot to report today. I just received the modified volume buttons today and they work perfectly with no additional additional tweaking required. I just popped one into a case, laid in the board, and they work perfectly. One interesting note is that, this run of sample parts was made with, I think, straight ABS. I did some asking around and found a very high quality PC/ABS blend from a specific plastics maker, which the previous samples were made from. OMG! What... a... difference!! The straight ABS feels pretty cheap, but the PC/ABS blend has a really nice high quality feel. Holding the two side-by-side the difference is stark. First production run The PCB contractor is getting the base circuit boards in this week and wants to do an initial pre-production run of 70 pieces first. They already have all the component parts in. I have an order of the Bluegiga WT32 headed their way as well. Once they're ready to roll, I'm going to try to take a swing down by their facility and video the process. The pick-and-place machines that populate the boards with the components are really cool and very fun to watch. (I think I posted some photos in a previous update.) It will be extra special to watch our boards being run. Hopefully I can have that video for next week's update. - - - - - - Sorry for the light report today, but that's what I've got for now. Hope everyone has a great Thanksgiving holiday (if you're in the US). Minor Mold Modifications While doing some initial assemblies I ran into trouble with the volume buttons. The tolerances to make these little guys function properly is very tight. Here's what the volume buttons look like mounted to the circuit board. Inside that tiny square metal housing is what is called a snap dome switch . Normally these are actuated by pushing down on the top of the dome, but we need to actuate the switch from the side. So, that small black piece of plastic pushs down on the dome inside the unit. Our molded part for the volume buttons on the outside have to push on that little black part enough to allow it to push the dome and actuate the switch. Below you can see our molded buttons are like a little cap covering that switch. The samples we received were done correctly, but they were just a hair's breadth short of actuating the switch. It took me a while to figure out exactly what was going on. When installed, the molded volume button (the cap) pushes the internal button, but the rim of the cap bottoms out against the PCB just before the snap dome gets triggered. Here is some of my communication with the molding factory. I managed to modify the buttons to make them work perfectly , but it takes me half an hour or more to modify one button set. In other words, not something I can do in production. And you can see, the difference in the depth of these two parts is very very small. But the difference in how the button functions is, well, the button on the right does not work and the button on the left works like a dream. The molder needs to make this small modification before I can continue with final production. They're making this modification this week. 3000 PCB's on the way We're committing to run 3000 units with the production facility. They ordered all the printed circuit boards for these and they're on the way. That will cover all the orders outstanding and more. Once these start rolling, all the orders should be filled pretty quickly. These initial pre-production units I'm doing are going slow but that's to be expected. Part of what I have to do is create an efficient assembly process so that these can be knocked out quickly and accurately. And there are definitely a number of little tricks that are required in order to make the whole package go together nicely. Many of these initial units have need assembly, then disassembly, then reassembly, and so on. But when I do it right, it snaps together cleanly and really nicely. I just have to codify the exact process so that it's easily repeatable. Multi-Point Uses I've been doing some experimenting with an Elroy and found some interesting ways that it can be used. We still don't have multi-point enabled but I've noticed that you can utilize the same capabilities that are already built into the iPhone (haven't tested an Android device for this yet). If I pair my Elroy to my iPhone, then also pair my JamBox to my phone, I can use my Elroy to adjust volume and for pause/play/advance tracks while listening through the JamBox. Then, if a call comes in on my phone, the JamBox will go silent and I can answer the call by removing an earbud from my Elroy. This works the same with my Airport Express that I have connected to a speaker system. The one thing still missing is being able to, say, watch a movie on my iPad and then answer a phone call coming in on my phone. Nor can we yet have two phones connected to the Elroy. That will require activating multi-point on the Bluegiga module and reprogramming the firmware to handle the various potential scenarios. That will be coming later. Well, we had a fumble on the play. I was supposed to ship out our first small batch of units last week, but we had a fumble between the engineers and the contractor. An email with the latest board updates went to the contractor... and that went into his junk mailbox. We didn't catch it until Tuesday. Now these same final boards are expected to be completed tomorrow. Everyone involved feels a little embarrassed about this. I really should have followed up sooner, even though we've gone through the same process 4 times previously without a problem. The contractor says this is the fastest they can turn these boards. They said they'd do their best to try to make up the time with the larger full production runs. "Fix the problem, not the blame." One of the ways I've found the maintain sanity being an entrepreneur, given that problems like this are part and parcel to daily business, is to use this phrase that I picked up from the Sean Connery/Wesley Snipes movie Rising Sun . This line fit perfectly with things I was reading at the time about manufacturing systems back in 1993. You can almost hear Connery saying to Snipes, "The Japanese has a saying, kohai. 'Fix the problem, not the blame.'" This is to say, you're accomplishing nothing when you spend time trying to point fingers at who is "responsible" for a problem. While it tends to be human instinct to try to pin a problem on a person, it does nothing to address the actual problem at hand. No one ever intends to cause a problem. Problems are merely a systemic breakdown that requires a systemic fix. Once you de-personalize problems, suddenly you open the door to solutions. When people are made to feel embarrassed about problems, they tend to hide them. You want your organization to reveal problems, instead, so that creative solutions can be applied. In this case, this just comes as a simple reminder to myself that, I need to follow up on emails like this if I don't get a confirmation of receipt. It's also a powerful reminder of how well things work when regular, methodical processes are in place. Processes that need to be established as I build this business. In the meantime... Here are some images of the final plastics fully assembled. New Options Now Available As many of you know, my calling card is customization. Mass customization is what put Timbuk2 on the map when we were a small company looking to define ourselves differently from other bags companies. I love doing mass customization. I know how to do it extremely well without adding extra time and effort. So, when I got the final plastics for Elroy in... I really couldn't help myself but to try this out: The opposite colored buttons had presented a problem because the volume buttons are cut into the same mold as the back and front rim parts, and there is a large difference between white and black orders. The faceplates, though, don't have this limitation since they are on a separate mold. This is a fairly easy thing for me to manage in production. So, if anyone would like one of these configurations let me know in an email (<email>). Be sure to include the following information. List all 5 in the email, don't leave any for me to guess: Body color (black or white) Faceplate color (black or white) Faceplate style (diamond, perf or oak) Volume button color (black or white) Earbud color (black or white) If you're satisfied with the selection you specified in BackerKit, there is no need to send an email. If you previously requested opposite color buttons and are satisfied with that, also no need to send an email. Only email me if you are interested in reconfiguring your Elroy. And one other thing... The original T1 samples I got were made with straight ABS, and we thought the feel of it could be a little improved. So, we located and specified a PC/ABS blend that we liked better. The factory ran off a few clear samples of this as a test. I can make these into KS rewards if anyone is interested. There are only 9 available. The first 9 people to send me an email for these can have them in place of their selection on BackerKit. After the 9 are claimed I'll post a comment below to say they've all been claimed. Please look to see if they've all been claimed before sending your email. - - - - - - - So, again, my apologies for the extra delay. We're very very close now. My Poor Laser Printer Okay, you guys are going to kill my sad little 10 year old HP laser printer. I've been printing out all the packing lists for orders and here's what it looks like so far. And this is less than half of the printing that I have to do. There are right at 1500 orders to fill, and each has to have 2 copies of the packing list, one for your package and one for my files. Then there's some other material I need to print out to go with your orders as well. That's around 6000 pages of material. All the domestic orders will go out by USPS Priority Mail. I chose this because I can get these boxes from the USPS for free. Otherwise I'd have to pop another $1.50 or so for shipping boxes on top of shipping charges, which has a way of adding up. This is only 500 of the shipping boxes. That's the limit I can order from USPS at one time. More are on the way. This weekend I've been cleaning up and preparing to set up a work station for assembling Elroy's. As I've discussed all along, one of the key parts of this project is to set up domestic manufacturing. Most other KS projects are running over to China to produce their products in their entirety. They then take delivery of their entire order and, if the number of units was high enough, they usually find a fulfillment house to process all the orders for them. I have nothing against this. It's just that my long term strategy for this company will require that I have my own domestic facility. That means I'm the fulfillment house for this KS project. I'm going to be assembling each and every one of your Elroy's myself. First Products About to Ship I was hoping we could blast out a bunch of orders right away, but that's not going to be a very prudent approach. This is the first electronics device I've ever produced, and everyone with electronics experience is telling me: "There will be problems." So, I'm assuming there is going to be a steep learning curve as we get out of the starting gate. If I busted out every Elroy and there was a major problem, we'd all be hating life. Initially, these are going to go out as a trickle. Then a larger batch. Then after we're firm that everything is looking good, we'll bust out the rest of the orders. I don't have a way to prioritize anyone's specific order at this point. It's going to be luck of the draw if yours is one of the orders at the top of the list. We've done a lot of testing but if you're on the top of the list, that means you've been granted Guinea pig status. I believe we have worked out all the major bugs. If you lucky Guinea pigs do run into problems, let me know as soon as possible so we can address it quickly. Any units that do have problems, we will take back and replace. Just A Little More Patience I know everyone wants their Elroy yesterday. I want everyone to have it day before yesterday. But we have to do this right so that we make sure you get a product that you love. The coming couple of weeks are probably going to be the most interesting of all, from the standpoint of these Monday Updates. I'll go down to the PCB contractor and get some video of the pick-and-place machine that populates the parts on our boards. I'll also do some video of me doing final assembly work and packing orders. With that I will take some time to explain better what I do in terms of applying Toyota-style manufacturing systems to the assembly process. I think you'll all find it very interesting. Volume Button Colors Last week it seemed pretty clear that most people prefer tone-on-tone for the volume buttons. That makes things much easier for me. But one of the big advantages of assembling these myself is that I can be far more flexible than a company having their product produced off shore. So, for those of you who would like to have opposite color volume buttons, just send me an email (<email>) and I’ll make sure to assemble your Elroy the way you want. Be sure to include your name as it shows up in BackerKit so I can connect your request to your order. If you want tone-on-tone, no need to send an email. That will be the default configuration. Status of T1 samples The T1 samples look really good. (Images below.) Remember, the finishing work has not been done on these yet. These samples are just for testing the fit. There are a few issues that have come up that we have to fix. There is a very slight difference in the distance between holes for the volume buttons and the buttons themselves. This is causing them to bind a little. Also, the faceplates ended up being too long for some reason, so in the image below I had to modify them (sand them down) in order to get them to fit. We have to get the factory to modify the mold to fix these problems. These should be pretty simple fixes. The little tooling marks you see on the sides will also be fixed prior to the final test (TF). And, um, please try to ignore my terrible manicure in these photos. Note: The first 3 photos are without the side plates installed, so you can see the PCB through the opening. Here's a small example of the sort of exchanges we have going with the molding factory. Our mechanical engineer creates these modification drawings and then the factory will respond with notes or questions. Your Mileage May Vary I did another battery life test the other day and the results rather surprised me. I don’t want to promise these results, so I’m going to keep our stated battery life at 5 hours for playing music. But this last test I got just shy of 7 hours of battery life while just letting my prototype run non-stop playing music. We may not get that much life out of production units as we tweak various internal settings. But we’ll try to max it out as best we can. Elroy 2.0 Kickstarter As if I don’t already have enough to do, I’ve started planning my next Kickstarter project, for Elroy 2.0. I can’t yet divulge what we’re going to do for Elroy 2.0 but I’d like to get your help. As you probably understand by now, I believe these Monday updates are an important aspect of executing a great Kickstarter project. A Kickstarter project is more that just raising funds to create something, it’s about sharing the journey after the funding is complete. After all, that’s where all the excitement is! It would be great to get quotes from you, our Elroy 1.0 backers, about how important you found these updates. At the same time, it would be great to hear any critiques you have of the process. Let me know what you think I could do better when running the Elroy 2.0 Kickstarter project. I want to include some of your quotes in the next Kickstarter. Let me know if you prefer that I don’t use your real or KS name. Later, after we get Elroy 1.0 into your hands, we’ll get your feedback on the actual product for how we can improve on it for Elroy 2.0. For now, this will be all about the process of running the KS project. And because I know you’re going to ask: We’re tentatively planning to deliver Elroy 2.0 in August or September of 2014. And yes, we have some special new twists on the concept. Moving along We've got nearly all the component parts in to start moving production forward. I have to tell you, I'm annoying my wife these days with the number of times I tell her how much I love how the earbuds have turned out. The factory went the extra mile to get a good 8mm driver. The molding is top notch. The aluminum parts on the earbuds look great. The quality of the cord is excellent. Here's a snap shot of the parts we have ready to roll right now. Mold Modification The last thing we're waiting on at the moment is for the mold on the external case parts. The factory contacted me on Thursday saying they needed me to authorize a modification to the front plate answer button. There was a undercut there that they could not accommodate. The modification they make is going to cause the faceplate button to be a little bit stiffer to the touch but it should be fine in our opinion, so we gave them the go ahead on that change. They needed a few extra days to make this adjustment, and after this they will send a "T1" sample of the case. This is a "fitting test." They need to make sure all the parts are fitting together correctly, and we need to receive T1 samples to make sure the PCB and battery are all fitting together correctly before proceeding. After we confirm everything is correct we can proceed with surface texturing on the mold, per these specs below. Feedback Request I'm running into one challenge that I didn't foresee. The breakdown on color selections are running about 5-to-1 on black-to-white. I was hoping the proportions would be a little closer. It becomes a problem because we've presented the product with opposite color volume buttons. Black units have white volume buttons and vice versa. But the mold is cut with only one set of buttons. I have two ways to solve this. I can either cut another mold just for the extra buttons we will need to compensate for the differing proportions of white and black. Or I can switch the buttons to be tone-on-tone, meaning black buttons on black units and white buttons on white units. It would be great to hear from KS backers here which solution you prefer to see. PCB revision 5 We have been working with the 4th revision of our PCB lately, and it's sounding good (I'm listening to The English Beat with my Elroy right now) but there are some improvements we want to take care of while the mold is still being cut. There's always one more thing you can do improve the PCB, and we could probably go through 2 or 3 more revisions and continue to find ways to tweak it to make it better. At some point it becomes diminishing returns, but we felt doing one more round would be well worth the effort. Another Delay :-( Well, I had some communication errors with the factory producing the mold for the Elroy external case. I had requested that they produce what's called a soft mold. A soft mold is one cut from aluminum for the purposes of doing a short run of product. You can cut an aluminum mold much faster than a steel mold, but you can't get anywhere near as many shots from the mold. A steel mold can do 20-30k shots, whereas a soft mold you'd be lucky to get 3,000 shots (plenty for the KS rewards). The cost is roughly the same to cut a soft mold. The advantage is just time to completion, which in this case was my preference. Somewhere along the way the molder missed the fact that I was needed a soft mold and they started cutting a steel mold instead. I was expecting to get finished plastics this week, but it's going to be an additional two weeks for them to finish the steel mold. This really only affects about 1/3 of you Kickstarter backers since the plan was to be ramping up production of the PCB these next two weeks. My schedule was to produce 100 this week and 500 the following week, and then 1000 in the first week of November to allow the PCB producer to work through any potential problems. Now it looks like I'll be putting out all the KS rewards in the first week or 10 days of November. At this point I can't foresee any other challenges coming up that would delay this any further. Back clips are coming in. Earbuds are coming in. USB cords are coming in. Travel cases are coming in. And now I know exactly when the final plastics are coming in. From there it's just ramping up PCB production. In The Meantime... Here are some photos of a pre-production prototype that I've been working with. This is a 3D print painted and assembled with the final PCB. It's a fully functioning version of Elroy. Unit number 00000001. So, hang tight folks. I'm really sorry for the delay but these things happen. We're really really close. Understand, there's no one who is going to be more ecstatic than me to be shipping your Elroy to you. A Few Stats from BackerKit Thought everyone might like a little perspective on what other people are choosing for their Elroy rewards. Maybe this is only interesting to me, I don't know. I always enjoy looking at stats. So far 1156 people have finished the BackerKit survey and we have a little over 300 people who've yet complete theirs. If anyone is having trouble getting in to BackerKit please let me know and I'll re-invite you. And as for responses to the follow up question regarding what you'd like to see on Elroy 2.0, here are the responses so far. What's interesting about this is, 1) It's pretty clear what the two top choices are, and 2) They are (as my EE pointed out) at odds with each other. More battery life and smaller device are somewhat contradictory to each other, but it also help me know where we should focus our energy on the next device. Remy's Snakes I also wanted to show everyone the progress we're seeing on Remy's snake faceplate design. I'm working with a modeler in Hawaii named, Nate Clowar , who does excellent modeling of animal forms. We're not quite done yet but we're getting close I think (subject to Remy's okay). I'm keeping this update fairly short because I've got a ton of work to do. Much more coming next week. It's Survey Time! Okay, after spending some time going back and forth with the BackerKit people, I've decided to use their system. It's kind of expensive (IMHO) for what it does but it's going to work well for collecting all the add ons that we set forth during the Kickstarter project. I'm adding a few items for everyone to choose from. I'm adding a full length set of earbuds based on our current design, for $29.95, and I'm adding four new t-shirt designs done by my friend Joe. Here are the t-shirt designs: Here's How the System Works... I'll be sending out an invitation for BackerKit shortly after I post this update. Follow the link and you'll be able to sign in (I think you'll have to create a password). From there you'll have one or two survey questions based on what pledge level you chose. If you pledged additional money during the Kickstarter, that will show up as a credit. On the following "Add-ons" page you'll be able to spend that additional credit as you see fit. There are a total of 13 items to choose from. You can add as much or as little as you like. Even if you didn't add any money during the KS campaign, you can order additional items in BackerKit. The BackerKit system will ask you for credit card information if you go over your KS pledge. The $10 Rebate The rebate works like this: I've added an additional $10 credit to everyone's pledge. So, if you pledged $89, your pledge level will show up as $99 in BackerKit. After you select your Elroy color and style you'll have an extra $10 when you get to the add-ons page. You can spend that $10 on other add-on items or, if you like, you can select a $10 rebate check from the add-ons list (the last item on the page). Don't Delay! Try to do the survey as soon as you can so that we can start organizing the orders. As we ramp up production we will have to run orders based on whose complete information we have. I have a few other things to show but I think I will save them for next week so they don't get lost in the survey shuffle. The BackerKit invitation should arrive... right... after... I hit hit this.... button. Elroy Pricing Now that I've had more time with the Elroy development process and better understand the relevant cost factors, I've spent a good part of last week going through a more detailed pricing evaluation than was possible prior to the Kickstarter campaign. For those who don't know this work, you generally take two approaches to looking at pricing. Bottom up and top down. Bottom up means you look at your direct costs of production. You look at parts, labor and then add on what is a reasonable gross margin figure for your industry. Top down is where you start with what comparable products currently sell for, then work down through retailer margins, distributor margins, etc. You make sure you can remain profitable through all the sales channels where you intend to sell your product. Except in certain circumstances, the lower your selling price, the more product you're likely to sell. You want to be competitive with other products you're selling against. But you don't want to set a price that is too low and either push yourself to cut too many corners on quality or potentially miscalculate and sell your product at a loss. There are also certain price barriers that can vary from market to market. The long and short of the research I've been doing this week is, I feel comfortable dropping the price of Elroy from $89 to $79.95 . With the traffic the MeetElroy website is getting, we've seen a pretty good conversion rate (percentage of visitors that convert into a purchase) even given that these are pre-orders. The price drop should make that number a little better, and then when we're selling actual product, the conversion rate should improve again. Now... For you KS Backers I realize that most of you paid $89 during the KS campaign, and now that the product is about to launch I'm dropping the price. – Bad Rob! – I need to turn this into a positive for all of you for being so kind as to back this project in the first place. We already know you're going to get your Elroy before everyone else (save a few product reviewers). So, what I want to do for all of you is to offer a $10 rebate. AND, in addition to that, I'm going to let all of you choose exactly how you want to spend the dollars you backed this project with. Many of you did add-ons in order to help us get up to that $150k stretch goal. You ordered an extra travel case or extra long charging cord. Now, when I send out the survey to collect information on which style Elroy you want, you will have the option to take whatever extra goodies you want, or you'll have the option to take a larger rebate. Or, conversely you can spend that extra rebate on more goodies. It'll be your choice. The one caveat here will be, you'll have to give me 6-8 weeks after launch to send out rebate checks. I'll try to do it earlier but I'm expecting the month after launch to be cash intensive. Once I get past that, everything should even out and I can then send out rebates. Quite honestly, I owe all of you so much more for backing Elroy. I can never really thank you enough. Web Traffic and Social Media There is one thing I'd like to ask of all of you. Now that the new website is up and running, I'm looking to start generating more momentum in advance of the product launch. It would be fantastic if all of you could take a few minutes to do a post leading people to the MeetElroy website ( <url>~$7k. Pretty disappointing, but quite honestly, I'm really happy it did fail. At the end of that KS I sent a questionaire to all the people who did back the project and asked them what was the one feature that made them want to back the project. The response that came back was overwhelmingly: The magnetic docking system. From here the job was to SIMPLIFY! I circled up with my friend Joe Urich and we went back to the original simple design I had but refined it. Well, mostly Joe redesigned it and I added comments. To keep the internal development simple I identified the Bluegiga bluetooth module and got that up and running pretty easily. Then to keep the earbuds simple I found a Chinese manufacturer who had a stock design that wasn't too bad. From there I relaunched the Kickstarter with a new video from Harry Yuan. Harry was a connection I made through someone else connected in my network of friends. His name is Colin Owen, who also did a Kickstarter for his company, Sparse. Number 10 comes after the successful Kickstarter, that you are all part of, where started really getting all the electronic guts squeezed into this thing. The size increased about 10% mainly because when I did my original estimates for putting the Bluegiga module onto a PCB, I didn't leave enough room on the sides for the solder points. I wanted to keep the overall proportions the same so we just nudged everything slightly larger to accommodate. And that was good as well, because it gave us room to get enough battery in the device. As you all know, since we broke $100k we did our own custom earbud design, again courtesy of Joe Urich. Number 11 here shows all the parts coming into place. Then number 12 is a working unit with the diamond faceplate and prototype earbuds. These are still all done on 3D printers, except for the earbuds, which are the final mold. The following photos came in Friday from the earbud factory. The factory still has to make a minor modification to the mold in order to get the magnets glued into the back correctly. I'm expecting an update on that this afternoon sometime. We also just sent off the final CAD drawings for external case parts for Elroy to the molder. We're doing what is called a "soft mold" for the first round of parts. This is a mold made of aluminum that can be cut much quicker than a standard steel mold. The mold has a shorter life cycle that a steel mold but the turnaround is 16 days instead of 30+ days. Plus, we then have the opportunity to make any minor adjustments to the parts before cutting a steel mold. Below is a snapshot of one of the final changes we've needed to make. That thick black disk at the top that looks like a hockey puck, that is our mic. We were trying to find a good mic that had a pre-made boot around it but had no luck. So, we created our own boot for an existing mic instead. I have to run a separate mold with a different molder for the accessory cord attachments for those of you who want to use your own earbuds with the magnetic attachments. We decided we should be able to gang these two parts together onto one mold. And lastly, the final revision of the PCB is in process this week. We have our PCB factory identified and ready to roll. I just sent the factory our estimated production schedule through the coming months. The new website is up and running. Our marketing firm, Command Partners, will put out a press release on Thursday announcing the coming launch. It's coming down to the wire. I'm really looking forward to getting an Elroy into everyone's hands. Lead with the bad news Well, the bad news is, the earbuds need more time... And that's going to push out our delivery date. Yes, I could have told the earbud maker to just run with what they have but it's really not ready. I'll finish with some pictures of the earbuds at the end of the update. Don't get me wrong, the earbuds look really really good. I love how they're coming along. The factory just missed a few things. 1) They didn't get the logo on the base molded part. I wasn't clear why they missed this since it was in the CAD file. But it's not there and it needs to be there. 2) They didn't put the jack I wanted on the sample they had. I can't place an order for production parts without a finished sample. 3) The nice thing was, they offered to do the installation of the magnets. I was going to do that here but I'd much rather they do it. That also means any problems between size of the magnets and the holes receiving the magnets get worked out there before I receive the product. So, the long and short is, they need until Sept 15 to do some modifications on the mold and produce final samples. After that they need 30 days to produce an order. That puts our start shipping date at October 15. ...Yes, that's exactly 30 days and no time for shipping, but I'll go back over just prior to the 15th and hand carry a portion of product back myself. Bummer? Yes. But I really want this to be right. I hope everyone understands. In the meantime, let's take a trip... Back to China As mentioned in a previous update, a large portion of my traveling around between the factories comes by way of the factory's themselves providing a car and driver to pick me up. Sometimes I take a taxi but most the time they're finding someone to transport me around. Here is one of the fun elements of traveling around Shenzhen. Dash ornaments. One of my first factory visits was with the factory making the USB charging cords. And, of course, the factory visit is started with a standard fare of KingFu tea. And over tea we check out the cord samples. They look really good. I have to be honest, I really wasn't sure about these guys at first. My wife and I just happened upon them at one of the markets. I was originally hesitant to wire them the mold fee. But I bit the bullet and they did a good job. After our session of KungFu tea we head out to see their production floor. It was a very small but clean factory. They say they've been in business about 8 years. Assembling USB cords is pretty simple stuff, but they're doing a good job. Above is a worker testing cords with a simple table mounted device. She just has to plug in the two ends of the cord and a little light comes on if it works. A simple test but vital. Above, on the left are a line of vertical injection molding machines. On the right is assembly processes. This photo shows about half the entire factory. Like I said, small but clean. Okay, on the far right, seeing piles of inventory-in-process tends to drive me crazy (being a Lean manufacturing guy), but I give them a pass since they are cleaner than most factories. And below, the requested food shots. Those of you not interested in food can scroll past. Above is Tofu Pei. "Pei" means "skin." This is a version of tofu where they allow the surface of the soybean mixture to build a skin and they scoop that off and allow it to dry. My wife cooks this all the time. It's great. These are some of the most interesting buns I've ever seen. It's a standard steamed bun but made of strips of dough wound into balls. De-lish! Here's a fried mixture of veggies and "mu er" in Mandarin, or "mohk yi" in Cantonese. It's a form of lichen that translates into English as "wood ear." And a nice bowl of curried mushrooms with broccoli. Back at the hotel room here I'm going over the samples of USB cords again. Here's my ride to the molding factory and this driver's Buddha dash ornament. At the molding factory, here was a process I'd never seen before. Do you know all the silicone iPhone cases you see out there? Well, this is the first step in the process of making those. They knead this big batch of silicone "dough." They add color and then press that down into flat cakes of silicone that are then cut into appropriate sized rectangles for the molding machines. This photo is of the big kneading machine. Check out the honkin' big motor driving that thing! Above is one of the big computer cutting machines used to cut the big steel molds for injection molded parts. This is part of the process where they use a copper electrode to either cut or texture parts. This is a very small number of the steel molds used here at this factory. These guys also had a bunch of ancillary process available for decorating molded parts. One of them is laser 3D printing. Heading back over to Hong Kong I ran into this interesting scene. This is a bunch of pre-school aged kids from Shenzhen heading over to Hong Kong for school. My wife says there's a lot of talk about this. Basically, people in SZ aren't so happy with the school system and think they're kids are better off in private pre-schools in HK. So, there are these big groups of tiny kids that get shepherded back and forth across the SZ-HK border each day. And, of course, I had to get something for my kids, since daddy was away for the week. Here's my work bag that goes to China empty and comes back full. I brought back 300 of the 3000 Elroy Travel Cases, and I brought back our entire order of 3000 batteries. My bag weighed in at about 65 lbs. That's 300 Elroy Travel Cases. There are another 9 cases this size that have to be shipped. You can see about how much room I have for clothing on a trip like this. Here's the bounty. I've already dropped of a few batteries with our EE. That's what 3000 little Li-Po batteries looks like... after a little baggage handling by the airlines. This is the latest prototype of the earbuds installed on the latest prototype of the Elroy. That's right, the factory also used the wrong cord size. I specified 1.5mm. They said this is 1.5mm. I pulled out my caliper and measured 1.3mm. They said, no it's 1.5mm. I pulled out a pair of Apple earbuds and I said, "Like this." Measured it. It's 1.5mm. They said, "No, that's 1.7mm." I said, "Okay then, make it 1.7mm, the size of the Apple earbud cord." That ended up being one other mold change they needed to make. They said the hole for the cord would need to be slightly smaller to accommodate the cord size I'm requesting. These are small earbuds. They feel really nice in the ear. I know a lot of folks are concerned about sound quality. I've requested the highest quality 8.1mm sound driver they can acquire. There's a big jump in sound quality between this size and the next size down. But, obviously, sound quality is going to improve with larger diameter sound drivers. As we prove this out as a viable business model, then we can begin to explore much higher sound quality and designs with larger sound drivers. And for all you hard core audiophiles out there, you'll still be able to use your own high end earbuds. And here is just a portion of the little magnets that we will have installed in the back of the earbuds. For any factory order about a $2000 order is minimum. With magnets this tiny that translated into an order of 120,000 pieces. This is just one box of 25,024 magnets out of 5 boxes total. It's a freaking lot of magnets. New Meet Elroy website During my evenings in the hotel room I've continued to work on our new website. I was able to launch that on Saturday after I got back. (I've only had about 3-5 hrs sleep a night for the past week or so.) Everything seems to be working. Please take a few minutes to go check out the site and tell me what you think. I'd love to get some feedback from a larger group of people. <url>"sans-family" trip I try to leave Sunday nights like this, hit the ground early Tuesday morn, and then put in 4 full days of factory visits. Then I leave late Friday night and am back in SF Friday night (due to the time change) and can have the weekend with family again. This trip I'm picking up the travel cases, magnets, earbud samples, back clip samples, USB charger cord samples, and a few other things mixed in. And while I'm at it, I've been instructed to pick up a Samsung phone for my mother-in-law while I'm in HK. :-) Elroy website I've spent a great deal of time the past two weeks setting up and getting familiar with our new website/shopping cart. The designers are working the last round of changes for the front end. I've got all our inventory in the system and I've been running test orders, and everything seems to be in order. We're soft launching it this week sometime and planning a more formal launch next week. I've purposefully been keeping the MeetElroy website somewhat low profile. But as we're getting close to launch it's going to be time to start gearing up. As soon as we soft launch I'll do a special report to let everyone know. In the meantime, back on the home front, I'm working with PCB manufacturers on pricing and order turnaround. Our latest iteration of the PCB should be ready this week, and as usual our EE will need a couple of days to evaluate. Next Monday Next week should be a pretty full update. I'll have lots of photos of China (with some food shots thrown in, on request). I'm really looking forward to seeing the earbud samples. The photos so far look pretty good, but I want to check them out in person before sharing. ...Okay, flight's getting ready to leave. Need to head to the gate. Short update today Our EE has a late summer vacation and will be out for the week. It's a well deserved break. He's been working long hours. In the meantime we are working up a new version of the PCB that should go to the prototype maker this week. Probably won't have a new prototype for next week's Monday update, but shortly after that we should. Along with that we will have some new external cases ready with some minor tweaks. Component parts are starting to come in. Our first supply of batteries is now complete. The Elroy travel cases are complete. The magnets for the earbuds should be completed later this week. Next week I will be heading back over to China to confirm the prototype earbuds and get our first order of those rolling. In fact, I'll be on the plane most of Monday, arriving in Hong Kong late Monday night, SF time (Tuesday morning 6:30am, HK time). I'll try to work in an update before I jump on the plane, or possible just do a day late update after going to a couple of factories. I also have an RFQ (request for quote) out with a PCB maker here in the US that I want to use for production. I'm expecting to hear back from them soon. Things are slowly but surely coming together. It's been fun using my prototype Elroy this past week. I'm really enjoying the ability to just remove an earbud to answer the phone. It's so intuitive and simple. And there have been absolutely no glitches related to the docking system. It's worked flawlessly. It makes me stoked to have a patent pending for this feature! I'm really looking forward to using our own earbuds with my prototype when I'm in China next week. Here's my first video update You'll have to accept my apologies for getting the image flipped. <url>"turn key." Meaning, I just have to order the finished PCB ready for final assembly. This early in the process I'm thinking that's probably my best bet to keep things simple. Website In the meantime, we're also working on a relaunch of our website. The current site is very basic WordPress site and really more of a placeholder. Yesterday I had a meeting with the designers working on the new site and I believe we have a really great direction forward. One of my pet peeves with company websites is that most all have no life. They're well executed, yes. They're clean, professional, yet almost devoid of genuine personality. I would say most websites are like meeting a well dressed mannequin at a party. They look good, they're well dressed, but not much of a conversationalist. I hope we're going to fix that with Elroy. - - - - - Of everything discussed above, the antenna interference is our biggest nut to crack. Everything around that will be moving along on schedule. We're hoping the antenna doesn't cause any delay, but we don't quite know yet how easily the solution will present itself. Our EE is a very sharp guy and I have a lot of faith in his abilities, not to mention his diligence and dedication. Next Monday I will try to do a video update showing the current Elroy iteration in action. I'll answer calls, play music, etc. I'd like to give everyone a sense of how the unit is functioning. But the EE needs a couple of days to rework the small fixes on the boards first. And with that, we'll see everyone Monday! PCB's in today ...But the EE needs a couple of days to validate the boards. We have a weekly Wednesday morning meeting with the ME, EE and myself. This Wednesday we will be going over the PCB and the external case assembly, the result of which should be the first completely finished prototype (sans earbuds). So, I know everyone loves lengthy and detailed Monday Updates, but if you'll bear with me, I'd like to do a more comprehensive "Wednesday Special Report" in the afternoon after we get all these parts assembled. Another Monday rolls around and... Still no PCB. Sorry. The file ended up going off to the prototype facility last Friday, and they have a 5 day turn. So this Friday we should have 4 working prototype boards. We're holding back on prototype parts for the external case so that the ME can make sure everything is right before making those prints. Being that each of those prototype prints of the case runs about $400 (for each case), it makes sense to be sure it's right. I also just checked up on the factory that's making the back clip and they're running into some problems. If I understand him correctly, he thought he could produce the part though a series of stamping procedures. But the turn at the top of the piece is probably going to prevent that working. That means he's going to have to use a different process to get that full turn done accurately. Once he's ready his job will go very fast. No worries there. Surface Mount Technology Here's a photo from the local contractor who will be initially producing our PCB's. The top image is the first machine in the process, which is basically just an automated screen printer. The printer lays down solder paste (middle image) on the PCB boards. (The third image is someone else's PCB, not dissimilar in size from ours.) From there the boards go into an SMT pick and place machine. This machine picks up electronic parts off of a tape and places it onto the PCB. The solder is somewhat sticky so they stay in place on the board. <url>"Forget the fuel. Charge your gadgets. Support a better world." Definitely check these guys out. They're doing great stuff. .... And that's about it for this week! Wow! Where did the week go? Not a ton to report today. The next Elroy iteration should be done later this week. Our EE is in the process of reworking the PCB. There are a few minor modifications and a few fixes coming after the last prototype. The last version we weren't very happy with the feel of the volume buttons. They were fairly soft-feeling, and we're looking for something with just a bit more click to them. Here's an example of some of the small details we're working through. There is a small LED mounted on the PCB that requires a "light pipe" to show through the external case. Just this morning we were choosing which shape to use out of these. See if you can guess which I selected. PCB manufacturer Tomorrow morning I'll be meeting with a PCB manufacturer in Fremont CA to start getting ready for production runs. There's kind of a fun story attached to this. In the very early phases of this project I met up with an electronic products manufacturing firm not too far from me. We had a meeting to discuss my product concept, then they asked if I'd like to see their production area. Of course I said yes. So, they take me to the other side of their facility and there, in a glassed in room, is their SMT machine (Surface-mount Technology) that places electronic parts onto the green circuit board. On the side of the machine is the name JUKI in big letters. It was a slap-the-forehead moment since JUKI is my favorite sewing machine company. Suddenly there was this connection between my previous industry (sewn goods) and my new industry (electronics) with, not just a sewing machine company, but honestly, very much my favorite sewing machine company. This was part of my inspiration for wanting to again build my own manufacturing facility for Elroy. So, tomorrow, my meeting is with a contractor who's using JUKI machines. Other goings on... There's also a long list of other things in the works. Along with following the purchase orders I have rolling in China, and getting ready for PCB fabrication, and setting up financials and manufacturing tracking... We're also working on a new MeetElroy website. Middlecott design, who did the Elroy logo, is developing the look and feel of the site. Command Parters, the marketing firm we used during the Kickstarter campaign, will be developing the back end SEO, adwords, social media, etc to support the launch of Elroy. Next week A bigger Monday update will be next week as we anticipate the next iteration of Elroy will be ready. Until then, I hope everyone has a great week. Oh, and BTW... I chose light pipe #4 because I like the way it maintains and reinforces the aesthetics of the small reveal at the case split. Okay. I'm back in action now with new DSL service. First, for your entertainment, I wanted to share a video I took at a small park across from the hotel I was staying at in Shenzhen. I totally love this guy! He's clearly so into what he does, and that's something everyone should admire. There is a long tradition in China of men performing parts like these. In traditional Chinese opera the female parts were played by men, and those men were greatly revered. <url>~90mAh battery that most bluetooth units have, we'd be able to get that in there with no problem at all. But I'd like to get at least 150mAh in there if possible. That was a lot of the time in China, spent looking for stock batteries in a size we want. You can see we're looking at bowing out the back in order to accommodate the larger battery. This is loosely based on the bottom detail on a MacBook Pro. I think there are some things we can do to minimize the back, but we need to get through the first iteration and see what it physically looks and feels like. That first iteration will hopefully be done soon. Not sure if it will be by next Monday's update. We'll see. Finished Travel Case I was able to bring back finished versions of the travel case. The sample maker at the factory kept smiling at the finished product saying, "HonBoBau!" (Hamburger!) My friend, Dallas' first response was, "Whoopie Pie!" I kind of think of it as keeping to the Jetson's theme as a little space ship. My friend Joe, who until recently was a designer for Incase, loves this case. In case you can't tell from the photos, this is a very solid hard case design. It's going to do a great job of protecting the Elroy inside. Today we're just going to do a little photo essay of what's been happening. Hope no one minds me throwing in a few family shots along with the work stuff. Wife and kids on the plane to Hong Kong. (Right to left: Youyue, Sonny and Halei.) A grandmother who is VERY happy to see her grandkids again! Street barbecue in Hong Kong on a rainy day. Behind Youyue is her dad. Bicycle trailer carrying a load of styrofoam in Shenzhen. Working on travel case design at sewing factory. Having traditional Chinese kung-fu tea at earbud factory office. And some spicy fish head for lunch. This is the subway stop in front of Huaqiangbei, the huge electronics market area. Inside the Huaqiangbei market. This is a photo of just one corner of one floor of one building. There are, I think 5 buildings, each with about 5-6 floors like this. It's massive, and constantly moving. Picking out some battery samples. More Huaqiangbei madness. It's interesting. You can see that many of these little booth businesses are family run. They'll have their pre-school age kids there sitting on counters, sleeping here or there, or playing with old component parts reels. On to the factory that will be making the back clip for Elroy. This is one of the presses that form metal parts. These are the dies that fit into the press. This is the factory owner with a formed wire part. A typical metal D ring. This is two shots spliced together at a place called Material City. This is just one section of this place. It's similar to Huaqiangbei but has a much broader range of types of materials. The place is full of little shops that represent various factories and their goods. You can find fabrics, electronics, resins, buckles, tools, equipment, lighting, housewares, really almost anything you can think of. Found these wall chargers at Material City. It's really strange right now. This is almost all I could find of any reasonable quality. Every other USB wall charger design I found was utter crap, and in both Huaqiangbei and Material City there were tons of factories producing these. And we're making very good progress on the travel case. This is a new sample they made based on my feedback the other day. It's not quite done yet, but we're almost there. On other fronts, engineering is moving forward on both the external Elroy case and the internal electronics. We are on track to do the first iteration in the week after I get back to SF. We are also working up our bill of materials for the electronics so that we can get our costing in order. The idea here (once again) is to get all these parts lined up, bring them over and do final manufacturing in the SF bay area. Next week I can post some videos. I just can't do that from China since Youtube is blocked here. Reeds and Halls This week we've been working on the making sure we use the right technique for the magnetic sensing of the magnetic docking system. There are basically two methods for sensing magnetic fields. Hall effect sensors and reed switches . Our challenges are 1) that we are trying to detect the magnetic field through a metal plate, 2) we're trying to detect the field of two magnet set next to each other, and 3) we have to offset the sensor from the magnets due to the PCB being centered on the magnets. Hall effect sensors are definitely cheaper but we we having difficulty sensing the magnets through the metal plate. What happens is that the magnetic field gets "sucked up" (um, that's a non-technical term) by the metal plate. You can see this in the figure below (lower right). The other thing we figured out is that we need to make sure to keep the two magnets with their north and south poles oriented the same way. If you have them opposite you greatly reduce the magnetic field (upper left). After some testing we found that a reed switch does a much better job of reliably detecting the magnetic field. They're more expensive but, heck, the thing has to work reliably. So, there's really no choice as to which we'll use. Below are some experiments as to how to best orient the magnets and sensor. We're also making headway with the PCB and external mechanical engineering. The parts for this first iteration are starting to fall into place. You can see the battery is still not quite fitting into the case but we're going to work through that soon. One of my big jobs in China is to find a source for a battery that will best fit Elroy. I should have more info on that next week. Well, gang. I'd share more but our plane is getting ready to board. The kids are both wired and exhausted as we sit here in the SF airport at 11:30pm. My wife is so excited about seeing her family that I'm not sure she's going to sleep much on the plane. The next 10 days are going to be action packed. I'll have lots to share next Monday. Two steps back, one step forward Okay, I know everyone wants to know the nitty-gritty of what's happening on the inside of Elroy. Well, today I tell all, because inquiring minds need to know... The past few weeks have been a bit insane for me. When we were nearing the end of the funding period I began tying down all the engineering. The idea was to try to get a jump on the engineering process. And.... needless to say, that didn't quite go as swimmingly well as I'd hoped. The original engineers I'd been working with put in a full bid, and their timeline was 6+ months. They said that was even going to be tight, since they're a small firm and have limited bandwidth due to other projects. That would have put us out to about Christmas for delivery. This is probably what a lot of other Kickstarter projects run into but never tell you about. The price we got the original engineers was very reasonable, and they came highly recommended by Bluegiga. I'm sure they would have done a great job, but I promised August and I felt I needed to do my best to keep that promise. I have a tenacious streak, so I know I can usually get what I want if I push long and hard enough. I knew from the outset that my friend Joe was not going to be able to do the mechanical engineering for Elroy, so I was able to find a great ME (mechanical engineer) with some 20 years experience. She's been very patient while I've been getting the EE (electronics engineer) settled. In fact, she helped provide a lot of contacts for additional bids. Now we've been through a half dozen bids. Each time these take a couple of weeks for the firms to evaluate and submit. The clock ticking all the time... One of the bids that fell within our needed time frame was from a factory that works in conjunction with Bluegiga in China. But, given the tight time frame, (and even though the China bid was much cheaper) I've accepted a bid from a firm in San Francisco. I specifically chose these guys because they're nearby, so we can deal with issues fast, they have the bandwidth to put two engineers on this full time, and they have extensive bluetooth experience, having engineered products for Jawbone in the past. My experience is that the old adage that "you get what you pay for" almost always holds true. The EE firm I hired was the most expensive bid, but I also believe they will deliver the highest quality product possible. Long run, that's what is important. We are now projecting to start shipping Kickstarter rewards in late August. That's technically within the bounds of what I established during the Kickstarter, but I'll apologize ahead of time here, because I'm expecting only some of the rewards will ship during August, and most will ship during September as we ramp up production. I'm certainly not forgetting that part of this project is about making product in the US. The earbuds are still going to be made in China. The USB charging cord and other accessories are going to be made in China. Final assembly of the Elroy is going to be done here. I'm setting up a local PCB manufacturer (in Fremont CA) to produce the internal parts. We'll have the exterior case produced domestically as well. And then I will be doing the final assembly myself , mostly because I need to physically get my hands on this product to better understand the final assembly processes unique to this product. Initial engineering Getting into the engineering process, with new engineers, has involved stepping backward. Two steps back before taking the first run at it. The EE came up with a fantastic solution right off the bat. My original schematics included installing the WT32 backward inside the case. That allowed us to keep the battery at the back of the unit (near the clip) and the antenna toward the faceplate. This kept the battery from being in front of the antenna but it meant the antenna was facing backward and we were uncertain what issues that might bring up. The solution was to flip the Bluegiga WT32 over to the back of the PCB and center the PCB inside the case. As such.... <url>"release papers." They are the company that creates textures for a wide range of products that you can see here: <url>"Elroy: Enjoy simple." Walker will receive 2 Elroys and t-shirts Second Prize: Armando Sanchez "Nothing short of a great idea" Amando will receive an Elroy and t-shirt Third Prize: Marsh Johnson Elroy: "Live Life Untethered" Marsh will receive an Elroy with shorty cord. Fourth through tenth places, listed below in no special order, receive Elroy t-shirts. Carlo Calvez "Elroy: No Strings, Just Chords." Saif Al-Badri "Elroy: Cut the cord, enjoy the Music!" Anthony Chen "Elroy - technology Elevated" Matthew Fiori "for quantum disentanglement with your phone" Nihal Castelino "Elroy:Magnetic personality" Ken Stern "Untangle Your Life" Timothy Aranki "Elroy: Freedom to move." All great submissions! It's also really fun to see everyone's take on the idea because these help to expose how people perceive the product. Product development Mostly right now I'm working on getting all the pieces of this project rolling forward. This week we'll be getting a 3D print made of the earbud design so we can get a sense of scale and know how it actually feels in your ears. I'll have photos of that for everyone next week. My friends who have Kickstarter projects I have a number of friends who are currently running Kickstarter projects that everyone might enjoy checking out. I wanted to share these after my funding ended so that my plugging these folks didn't come off cheesy. These are all people whose products and designs I genuinely believe in. I don't get anything for sharing their projects other than just being happy to share the interesting work they're doing. The folks a Mission Bikes in SF do similar manufacturing to what I set up at Timbuk2, where they mass customize fixed gear bikes. They've teamed up with Revolights who did a successful Kickstarter last Fall. Together they're making a pretty interesting urban bike . My good friends at Boreas Gear are making a really cool modular back pack system. Funny story, when I first got into sewing bags, I wanted to create something vaguely similar to this for bike panniers, but I ended up settling on making messenger bags. Boreas seems to have nailed the concept down quite well. I'm impressed. Last, the designer that I work with, Brook Banham and his Middlecott Design, is working in conjunction with a company launching a line of clothing and accessories that you might like, called Red Hand . Okay, first things first. I know everyone is wondering about the travel case. We clearly didn't make the stretch goal. But I'm totally overwhelmed at all the support that everyone showed trying to get us there. Just half an hour ago I received the quote from the factory for the travel case, I've put it in my budget figures, and we're still going to do the travel case for everyone. It's quite clear that the travel case adds a lot of value to the overall package. It's going to be a really nice piece. And, more than anything, you folks have been so fantastic and so supportive, how could I not deliver on something everyone wants? Monday updates I know I've said this many time, but I want to make sure everyone knows... Each Monday until we ship Kickstarter rewards I will be doing a Monday update. Communication is the most important part of helping everyone feel that they're part of the process, and that's what all of your are. You're very much an integral part of growing this new small company. I encourage your feedback and ideas. So, I've got a lot of work to do in the coming weeks. I'll leave it at that for now, and have a new update for you on Monday. Thank you once again! Rob Honeycutt The best way you can help us get to $150k This is where the power of social media comes into play. If I can get each of you to take just 2 minutes of your day to share Elroy on Facebook, Twitter and any other social media you like, the impact can be profound. If just one-in-six of our backers had just one friend who came on to pledge, we'd make our stretch goal with ease. Add-on reminder! I'm sure there are many who missed the last update, and there are many new backers since that update, so I want to tell everyone again about the add on items you can get with your Elroy. Here's what we have: USB wall charger for Elroy - $10 X-long USB charger cord (3ft) - $5 Second set of shorty cord earbuds - $20 (that's $20 off reg price) Second EVA travel case - $10 Second Elroy t-shirt - $20 ($5 off reg price) For more details on how to add these to your pledge please refer back to Update #12. EVA travel case update We had a great suggestion from one backer, Dallas Pyle, to use recycled foam for the travel case. It's a fantastic idea. I've seen exactly these piles of foam remnants at factories in China. What a great cause to collect and reuse it! Definitely check out the PLUSfoam website. This one is a no-brainer. This also got me thinking about where else I could recycled materials. I have very good connections for recycle PET fabrics through a supplier in Taiwan. I've sent out inquiries to see if I can get recycled PET ballistic for the exterior and recycled PET tricot for the lining material. This way you can protect your Elroy and feel extra good about it too. There are some potential options for doing similar things with the Elroy itself, but that's something we'll have to go a little be slower with. I first want to make sure that we deliver a great product that functions as we expect. Elroy earbuds update We're very pleased with how the earbud design came out. In fact, we're so pleased that we're going ahead with filing a design patent on these. There are a few more minor tweaks that Joe is making on these, including the base reflex holes on the back, and adding a logo in between the magnets (both suggestions from backers). Once he gets that done we'll post some more illustrations. Elroy update And what of the Elroy itself? Meetings, meetings, meetings. I now have a list of over a dozen suppliers I'm going to be working with to pull together all the component parts for Elroy. It's feeling very real. The news on the Elroy base unit is probably going to be a little light in the early weeks here as we get all these things pulled in line. Then we should showing everyone lots of fun stuff. A little anecdote Back in my Timbuk2 days we used to do this totally crazy thing. We used to throw all our sewing equipment in the back of a huge truck and bring, basically, our entire factory to the trade shows with us. At the shows we'd make product for people, right there in front of their eyes. It was a huge effort to pull off, but man did people love it! It made our product more than just a great bag, it made it real to actually see how it was made. Through the coming summer, as we craft Elroy into a finished product, I hope to capture some of that same experience for all of our KS backers. Great products are all well and good. That's expected these days. I want to take it a step further and make it more REAL for everyone. I want every one of our KS backers to feel like they took part in the creation of a great product. Monday updates Monday updates will continue through until we ship product to backers. I promise, after the funding closes I will not be pestering everyone with updates every other day. I hate spam as much as the next guy. The only time I will break this rule will be if there is something just so insanely cool to share that I can't bear to wait for the Monday update. - Rob Still gonna make the stretch goal, with your help! I've watched a lot of Kickstarter projects and the week before the end is always the doldrums. Then right at the end there's a mad rush. I'm sure we're still going to beat our $150k stretch goal in those last couple of days. And I really want to, because the travel case will be a very cool addition to the product mix. To help us along the road here are a few extra perks everyone can add to their current pledge. These are just a few simple accouterments to enhance your Elroy experience. All you have to do is total up what you'd like to include, and add that amount to your current pledge. At the end of the pledge period we will be sending out a survey, and in that survey you can mark the items you chose. Here's what we have: USB wall charger for Elroy - $10 X-long USB charger cord (3ft) - $5 Second set of shorty cord earbuds - $20 (that's $20 off reg price) Second EVA travel case - $10 Second Elroy t-shirt - $20 ($5 off reg price) Couple of notes here: 1) The charger is a standard 5W wall charger and we will offer it with the standard socket configurations for your country. It will be useful for charging any device which uses a USB port. It'll be small, compact and perfect for travel. 2) Elroy will include a short charging cord, so if you need a long cord, this is the time to pick that up. Definitely check these guys out! Regardless of how much battery I pack into the Elroy, some of you power users are going to figure out a way to run the thing dry. I've taken notice of another project on Kickstarter that will fit the bill in that situation. Check out Devotec's Fuel Micro Charger. They started on Kickstarter the same time as Elroy and their emergency charger would be a great way to keep your phone or Elroy charged up when you are on the go. They have a funky little design, and I am chatting with them about working together on some cool new product ideas. The link to their KS project is here . New Elroy earbuds update Joe made some adjustments to the design based on feedback we got from everyone. Here's the latest image that he just sent over to me. I think I'm liking these a lot! Would love to hear everyone's thoughts. My buddy Joe is on it and working. Check out these first iterations. Note: Cord and jack not shown in these illustrations. Let us know what you think. First $1000 backer! I want to send a shout out to Remy Lee for becoming our first $1000 backer. Remy says she's very excited about designing her own Elroy faceplate and she's especially excited about our product launch party later in the summer. Remy, you've definitely earned a special place in the Elroy history books. Thanks! $150k stretch goal reward Well, I know everyone has been waiting to see what this little ditty is going to look like. So, here it is. Brook did up some sketches and then I started working on the spec package illustrations for the factory. This is going to be a hard shell case, sturdy enough to really protect your Elroy. It's small and should easily fit in your travel bag without being a big, annoying lump. Yet there will be plenty of space inside for your earbuds, extra ear tips and what-have-you. The zipper is set inside the outer rim in order to keep the look as clean as possible. I've keep the inside simple. It's just two elastic mesh pockets. This way we keep it more of an all purpose case. If you don't need it for your Elroy, it will still be useful for all sort of other small trinkets. The Elroy logo will be embossed into the top of the case. And the zipper puller will be a very simple logo embossed overmolded string puller. How to help make our $150k stretch goal We're down to the last week (essentially) of our Kickstarter campaign. This is our last all-out push to see how far we can make this go. We've certainly already raised enough money to bring Elroy to market. Every extra dollar we bring in makes it just a little easier to get that job done. Be sure to share the Elroy Kickstarter with Facebook and Twitter friends. And, if you haven't been to our Facebook page yet, be sure to wander over there and check it out. We're having some fun coming up with an Elroy tagline. There are lots of great suggestions up already. Be sure to add yours to the fray! Earbud design update My buddy Joe is now back in the real world after his extended bout of the flu. He's now busy working on modeling the earbud design up. We should have something to show everyone later in the week. (Pins and needles!) It's going to be a good week this week. I can feel it in my bones! Happy Monday to everyone! Rob Honeycutt Every great company has a great tag line and we don't have one yet. So, we thought we'd take the opportunity to turn this into a fun game to help generate some traction on our Facebook and Twitter accounts. Just wander over to our Facebook page and you can get all the details. <url>"shake test" just to find out for myself. Here's the result.... <url>#1000! - Rob As promised, here is our first Monday update. I'll be putting out an update every Monday until we ship our Kickstarter rewards. Earbud design work start With only $15k until we meet our stretch goal of $100k, we're already embarking on our own custom earbud design. We wanted to start this last week but my design cohort, Joe Urich, was flat out with the flu all week. He's just now getting back up to speed and we're meeting up tomorrow to start the process. Our goals are going to be to create a nice, clean and very simple, low profile design. We want to create something that will aesthetically fit with the variety of faceplate designs we have now and might introduce in the future. And we also want to rearrange the docking points on the earbuds so as to pull the earbuds down away from the buttons on the Elroy. We'll share concepts that everyone can comment on later in the week once we hit the $100k level. Moving forward on product development Now that we know we have our basic funding in the bag, we're moving forward with product development this week. It's especially nice to have met the funding goal early on. That gives us a nice jump on development so that we can make sure to get finished product to funders in our scheduled time frame. Second stretch goal - $150,000 Another suggestion came in this past week to offer a nice hard case for a second stretch goal reward. I'm very familiar with cases like this, having worked with factories that produce these. One of my pet peeves in manufacturing is companies who design products that are awful to produce. Very few designers have any notion of what pain they are causing production workers with some designs. The small hard shell earbud cases I've seen are just one such case. They're insanely hard to sew and cause repetitive stress damage to sewing workers' hands and wrists. BUT I have a design that will change that. It's still a hard shell case, but it will be almost effortless to produce, and I believe will be more attractive than other cases I've seen. I hope that by putting this design out into the market place all the earbud manufacturers who sell hard cases will adopt this design format and we can relieve the stress on many 10's of thousands of sewing workers around the world. So, this will not only be a nice reward level for backers who help us get to $150k, it'll also be doing something to improve the lives of workers around the world. We'll have some illustrations to share on this one, also, later in the week. Elroy with earbuds + T-shirt reward adjustment - DOH!! Someone kindly brought to my attention that the $120 reward level cost more than the Elroy and t-shirt separately. We were originally going to launch Elroy at $99 and priced the Elroy+tshirt accordingly. Then when we felt comfortable that $89 was a better price point, I forgot to adjust the $120 reward level. (Too many balls in the air.) I've created a new reward level at $110 for Elroy+tshirt. Anyone who pledged at the $120 level should feel free to change their pledge over to the $110 level. In the meantime, I'll go back and take a short remedial math course. Kickstarter reward emblem on products We had another great suggestion from a backer to add something that identifies the rewards from this Kickstarter project. I have a design I've submitted to Kickstarter and am waiting on their reply. I think this is a great idea. One way or another we'll do something to indicate that the Elroy's people receive from this Kickstarter project are unique. Make sure to share Elroy with your friends Remember, one of the most important things you can do to help this project along is to share on Facebook and Twitter. It's as easy as a couple of mouse clicks. $30,000! Funded in 8 hours!!! I can not say thank you enough times. This is going to be such a fun ride. I'm looking forward to sharing it with all of you!
