Hey Fans, We appreciate you and hope you have a great Fourth. We have closed the window for our Beta Testers. If you have any questions on getting the app installed please email us. Have a safe holiday and more updates to come next week. -Devium Hey Fans, We are closing the window to hop on and preview our apps at midnight tonight. If you are interested in checking them out please email <email> with your UDID number and the subject line of "June UDID Beta Tester." The easiest way to do this is grab the app UDID+ from the App store. We will update the app this weekend and you will receive an email on how to install! If you want to preempt the installation process head over to www.testflightapp.com, sign up, and update your profile with your UDID number. Test Flight is a development tool we use to ease dissemination, bug tracking, and communication. Have a great weekend! Thanks and talk to you next week. -Devium Hey Fans, We hope you are having a great week. We sure are. We have improved our app and want your feedback! If you're interested email us at <email> with your UDID Number. Make sure the subject of the email is "June UDID Beta Tester." If you can't find your UDID, fear not: There are apps that you can download that will allow you to email it right away. We recommend "UDID+." Thanks and talk to you guys next week. -Devium PS - The update failed to post on Kickstarter last night but for those following us on facebook may have noticed it posted there correctly. We will make sure that doesn't happen next week. Fans, Happy Thursday! Great news: We have had to stop taking preorders due to a massive amount of interest. With our first production run, we will build 500 units (as many of you may know). Between our patient Kickstarter backers and many other preorders we are thankful to be moving forward with all of you and promise to continue weekly updates. We cannot accept any other preorders because we are close to 500. Thank you to all of you who have submitted your address changes. We would also like to clarify if you change phones in the meantime, we can update which faceplate we send with your unit. Just email us at <email>. Thanks, Devium Hey fans, It's been a busy week for all of us. One partner has been busy exploring resources congress can offer us in DC. Our CEO is slammed with his upcoming last week of work. Our COO is busy filling all requests of the manufacturers to get the most accurate quote. If you ever start up a business it's safe to cut your profit margin by a third and add 2 weeks to 2 months to all anticipated dates. However, we promise to take care of you guys. Thanks for bearing with us! Devium Hey Fans, Great news this week: our CEO has saved up enough money to continue personally financing Devium while taking two weeks off of work. This will occur in just over two weeks. Also, we have thankfully found another company that can make a part of our unit less expensively. We are proud to let you guys know this because with our very limited resources, we will be able to put more of them into speeding this process up and providing you a quality product. We also found some other exciting news out. It’s not an update, but it’s worth sharing. As of today, there is no car stereo on the market that can boot up faster than 7 seconds. Our unit boots up in less than a second—almost instantaneous. No more waiting for music when you turn the car from “acc” to “on. Thanks, Devium Hey fans, Devium has been working on a formal flowchart for assembly and testing for our manufacturers this week. We have narrowed it down for two manufacturers for our first ten units and we will make a decision shortly after they are able to get us quotes. The turnaround for those ten units is around two weeks. We are also creating a timeline to develop packaging, including boxes the unit will be shipped in and the manuals that will come with each Dash unit. Thanks, Devium Hey fans, This week at Devium we are still on schedule and working out the logistics to obtain our ten prototypes for testing by the end of this month. We are also correcting shipping addresses for all our preorders who changed addresses, so be sure to email us with any change of address you may have had. We have also organized production of faceplates for iPhone 5 and some android products. Please let us know any questions, comments, or suggestions you may have. Thanks! Devium. Hey fans! This week at Devium we have been working on model 7. We replaced an obsolete part inside the unit. Model 7 is the unit we will be shipping to you. We have been evaluating a quote for ten units of model 7. We are producing ten of them for internal testing and will have them by the end of the month. If testing goes well, that means shipping to you guys will occur sooner. Talk to you next week, Devium Hello fans, Devium looks forward to this being the first of many weekly updates. Devium has been growing in partners and raising capital to develop the prototype in the last year. We have partners working on Devium all across the US. This weekly update should serve the purpose of bringing you all up to speed. First, to clarify, Dash has not failed. We are not doing anything with our funds except develop our product and company. Additionally, for your peace of mind: each partner has put far more $$$ into the product than the backers and want to provide you with the best product we can put out. As some of you may know we are on prototype number 6 (yes, we have added that many new features and upgraded the internals a few times). The new unit has bluetooth capabilities, a smarter docking mechanism, and better internals. We have also added a volume control that actually functions as a button (you can activate Siri or bring up our app). Much of this we have you to thank for all the ideas and feedback. While we apologize for our production delay, we are confident you will be even more satisfied with the Dash that we ship. If you would like more information feel free to message or comment. -Devium Hello fans, Devium is proud to announce we now have unpaid staff who will be posting weekly updates. Every Thursday we're making a commitment to give you an update, even if its not significant. These will occur weekly until our product has shipped. First update is scheduled to start this week on Facebook and Kickstarter. Thank you very much for your patience up to today. Devium Hello Everyone, We have made progress on the Apple Authentication Chip. We can communicate to from the phone to the chip but are still working on the radio to chip communication. We have to perform some cut and jumps and may have to perform some more to complete the entire Apple Authentication Chip communication but we are making progress. The physical updates we are making are being incorporated into the final product. The Authentication Chip is requiring much more work than anticipated. Then we can move onto working on the AM side of the radio, this will more quicker than the authentication chip. Once we have everything working via firmware with the associated hardware fixes, we will review the schematics and PCB design with our manufacture along with a few virtual electronic tests. I appreciate everyone's support. Dash is a complex project but we are close to finishing the final PCB design. Respectfully, Paul Firmware Apple Authentication We are developing the firmware to process the apple authentication properly. Our firmware developer is close to completing this capability. We need to make sure we can do this before beginning production on Dash. This is not a simple solution, thats why you see 90% of apple products connect only via bluetooth. Once we complete this we will know how hardware design is solid. Bluetooth We can control Dash via Bluetooth . To show the Bluetooth control I have made two videos one using the iPhone and the second using our Android development kit app. The Android app is visually not as polished as the iPhone but it is controlling Dash. iPhone Control <url>’s patience, we have been so incredibly focused 19-20 hours a day developing Dash and building Devium’s future that I didn’t complete the order in a timely manner. We have some very exciting programs in the future that I hope will make up for the delay in t-shirt shipments. If you didn’t order a t-shirt let me know they are 30 dollars and we ordered a few extras. If you already ordered a t-shirt or are just ordering one and want them signed by a member of the team, send us an email to <email> . If you want your Dash signed by a member of the team, send us an email too! As for delivering your Dash, we begin production of the first 500 units the week of August 20th right here in the US. Assembly will occur in the US as well. As units complete we will begin shipping them out mid-September in the order they were placed on Kickstarter. Your support has been integral and will continue to be a part of Devium’s future. We want you to be satisfied that you are an early adaptor of Devium technology. To that end, we are setting up a questionnaire program to receive your input. This may be the coolest and best reason to answer a few questions. When you receive your Dash it will be accompanied by three questionnaires to be answered over a few months. First questionnaire focuses on your initial reaction and installation (if performed DIY), the second is 3-4 weeks into using Dash, and the third is 7-8 weeks. If you complete the first two you will receive a gift card number for a free Faceplate, which will not expire, for any phone that we support. If you complete all three, you will receive a gift card number for a free Dash, which will not expire. So you could use it for a current Dash model or a Dash five years from now. Both must be redeemed via our website and not through a partner. Devium is gaining traction every day and it is difficult to answer questions directly via Kickstarter due to the amount of work going on and we are expanding the team to compensate. If you have questions please use our website so that our ticketing system can take over. This way we will make sure to respond within 24 hours. <url>…that is the question. Dash has the answer. Hardware. Dash is shipping with a Hardware EQ. I can’t giveaway too much. Who doesn’t like a little anticipation ;) I am keeping the number of bands l in my pocket for now. We, I can say We now - which is very cool, are continually striving to make Dash the product you are excited to own, to use, to share, to tout and to boast about. Stay tuned… Hello Everyone, It has been a few weeks since my last update. I want everyone to know Dash is progressing well. We have completed design and are moving forward with firmware and app development. We have three designs we have developed for the Dashboard app. This week I will be sending out another update and email to ask for your input and vote on which design direction we should proceed forward with for the Dashboard app. This will also affect our other apps because we want a universal design theme. T-Shirts will be arriving in our offices the end of this week and we begin shipping them out to you. The our international team is meeting in Denver at the beginning of June, following the meeting I will send out the post cards of the Team to that reward level. Following a graphical decision on our Dashboard app, we will move it into Alpha testing. If you are interested in signing a NDA and playing around with the App for a while let me know by emailing <email> . We would love your input. The website has been updated, if you havent been over there in a while, check it out. www.devium.com Its almost June and we are going to have some big updates (packaging design, physical faceplates and body, and more) and news next month! If you have any questions let me know. Thank you for your support! Paul Hello Everyone, It has been a very busy couple weeks since the campaign completed. We are finalizing board design and moving into prototype production. Dash’s new internals includes all of the awesome features introduced because of your desires and feedback: HD AM/FM Radio Bluetooth Video out Front, Rear, and Sub 4V PreAmp Outputs External Microphone Auxiliary In Audio Routing (More on this in coming weeks)! We are also in the process of selecting our contract and packaging manufacturer here in the US. In parallel we are developing our distribution and logistics network so that we can get Dash to you and our national retailers quickly ;). It’s incredible the amount of work that goes beyond product development to deliver that product to customers. I am learning daily. To help cover the amount of work required our team is growing. We have brought on two new members over the last few weeks. There is a lot of work to go but the team has a guttural fighter-type excitement driving us. We are beginning development of the applications to control Dash, the Dashboard and the Radio controls. Our apps are moving along. Here are a few snapshots of those apps. I can't go into detail on the Radio app but its has that "Ahh hell yeah!" vibe. We also have a new logo! I am going to work hard to keep everyone informed on where we are and how we are doing. Your trust and respect is paramount to our success. The road ahead is rough, hard, and new but it’s also exciting, incredible, and fresh. We are onto something extraordinary here and I am not going to slow down or relax until Dash is in your hands. Let me know if you have any questions. Thank you, Paul Lizer Hello Everyone, 60 edays ago I knew Dash was an incredible idea but I had a lot of unknowns. Dash has gotten even better over the last 60 days. Its more capable, more refined, more incredible and its more than an idea now. Dash will be a reality. I appreciate every single person who provided insight, ideas, constructive criticism, thoughts, praise, and encouragement. I appreciate those who have donated a dollar or ordered a T-Shirt. I appreciate those that pre-ordered Dash, you saw a product that will take your car and your phone to the next level. You wanted to be the first to have a Dash while kickstarting a company. I want everyone to find someone in their house or apartment to high five because you are a part of a community that believes anything is possible. Over the next few days I will be contacting everyone who pledged monetary support to get your mailing address and confirm the faceplate(s), and T-Shirt(s) you backed. If you haven't ordered a shirt but you want to let me know and I will send you our Paypal link and you can order as many as you want then. Today is an exciting day. I want to thank my team for helping me turn my idea into a product; Andrew Vorhies, Zbigniew Sobolewski, John Stamatiou, Tim Vlach, Jarrod Holland, and Mark Moran. I want to thank the Springs Startup for letting me know there is a world outside the vacuum of development; Jan Horsfall, Nick Lee, and Ian Lee. I also want to thank Jenny Schaub for her support and encouragement. Thank all of you, Paul Lizer One more push technologically before the campaign completes. I am happy to announce that Dash is now supporting worldwide AM Radio (520-1710 kHz) to supplement the worldwide FM Radio (64-108 MHz). This will allow sports fans, outdoor adventurers, and local radio supporters to continue getting what you need. Our radios are also HD capable so if you can get more out of Dash and your AM/FM stations if they are broadcasting in HD. 59 hours to go... Check out the shirts below! Following the completion of the Devium Dash campaign I will contact all of the T-shirt level supports and get your size. For those who preordered Dash if you throw in 15 dollars more I can send you a T-shirt. I wish I could send you one without the extra cash but we are running lean and mean here. I am incredibly thankful for everyone who has supported, shared their thoughts, and got the word out there. Let me know what you think of the T-Shirts. Dash for Dudes! Dash for Divas!! Pictures of the T-Shirts will be posted this weekend. I wish I could high five every one of you. The campaign has been amazing. I am incredibly grateful for everyone's encouragement, insight, and support. Its hard to believe we are near the end! One week to go! Good morning Everyone, We are increasing the number of Pre Amp Outputs to Three(3)! Now there is a Front, Rear, and Sub output. Also, the Pre Amp outputs are now running at 4 Volts! What does this mean? You have move control of your external amplified speaker system. With the 4V output you can run you amps at a lower power thus reducing the noise and have clearer audio and bass! Let me know what you think or if you have questions. Thanks, Paul tl;dr - Now, 3 Pre Amp Outputs running at 4V! We are developing a Car Connectivity Kit for release later in the year. This kit will connect Dash and your phone to the car computer and provide steering wheel controls. This will give you access to reading and clearing faults, and using apps like DashCommand by Palmer Performance and Rev by DevToaster . We are developing apps to take advantage of this capability as well. You will also gain access to your steering wheel controls. This kit will retail for 40 dollars plus shipping but for those who have preorder Dash will receive it for the cost of shipping. A real world thank you for your feed back and support. Check out Dash on TV. KTLA's Morning Show <url>"Fund it!" Check it out and let me know what you think! The campaign to get Dash funded is doing awesome. Everyone's support getting the word out is one of the big reasons why we are 58% funded with 41 days to go! Today I was forwarded a youtube clip of KTLA 5, Los Angeles and Southern California, Morning Show! Starts at 1:44 <url>’s support. Thank you, Paul <url>"5" may be released this summer and if its dimensions are similar to the current iPhones then it will work without purchasing a new faceplate. If the new iPhone varies too much, a new faceplate will be developed and released as soon as possible. Phone Cases I am listening to feedback and Dash will support iPhones with the bumper case and cases of similar size and iPhones with no case. This is possible because of the way phones are secured in the faceplate. The cavity, where the phone is located, uses rubber to grip your phone. The cavity will be expanded to fit iPhones wearing bumper cases snuggly. When you receive your Dash you will have the option to put the rubber piece in the cavity wall or not based on whether your iPhone is in a case. Output Dash has 4 x 50w to power your speakers but also has 2 preamps running at 2V a front and rear/sub. We are using Maxim developed amps, a company out of Sunnyvale, CA. Dimensions The body is double din standard, 4 inch by 7 inch. If you can install a GPS Nav unit in your car you can install Dash. We are developing general installation instructions for DIY but recommend a professional. Basic installation costs run about 50 dollars but that could vary based on your location.
