whats up y'all... I fucked up a good amount of these packages. I've come to find out I'm not very good at logistics, shipping and keeping this organized at all. I'm sorting out what went out and what didn't. In the meantime, I did the only thing I really know, which was make another album which all of you will be getting free along with anything else I do from here on out. I know this didn't go exactly as planned and I should've done a much better job but I allowed life and my own weaknesses get in the way. I know I'm not the most personable guy on the Internet either and I can be quite abrasive and I do apologize.. Please just bare with me. It will be worth everyone's while. LANDON THOMAS I never received shipping info from you, email <email> ASAP Mike Murray, you're email bounced back the digital download and i have no shipping info or other way to contact you. Joe DePietro I haven't received shipping info from you. Daine Rogers I haven't received shipping info from you. Please email <email> ASAP with your shipping info. There is still quite a few people who haven't provided shipping info. Email <email> with the package you backed in the subject and your info so I can get your stuff out to you. I emailed every single person that backed this project with this info it could've possibly gotten lost in junk mail, can't call it.. Hit me up. For those of you who haven't received your packages and continue to be patient I appreciate it and I will make it worth your while which is why I have been recording a new album which will be available soon. I will be getting the remaining packages out this week. For those of you like Glenn and this other clown, I'm gonna explain something to You very simply. Kickstarter does NOT provide shipping info, they give me spread sheets without names and only emails which I have to match to your replies. Nothing more. Between traveling and being a one man operation I have almost completed the entire thing. Kickstarter does not release the funds until over a month after the campaign ended, then the fun starts of organizing the sideshow that they give me via excel spread sheets. Now, I don't think I look like the type of guy who works in a cubicle and organizes spread sheets between touring and every other thing it takes to make a record successful but none he less I did it and continue to finish MY JOB. If you're an Internet troll who insists on harassing me, you can eat a dick. That's the one and only time I will explain myself. Peace. Sorry I've been out of touch... CD packages are on the way. Vinyl packages will be shipping soon, that shit takes forever to press. Shirts came in fucked up so I sent them back, didn't want to give you guys half assed material. All other packages shipping soon. I apologize for all delays, didn't have any clue how many of you liked me, it's a little overwhelming and I'm truly grateful for the support and I appreciate your patience. PS... Signing everything is a bitch!!! <url>
