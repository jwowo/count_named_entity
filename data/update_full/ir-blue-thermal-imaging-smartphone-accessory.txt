We have shipped all of the rewards and hopefully most people have received them by now or will soon. International orders please be patient as some countries are taking 3-4 weeks for delivery. We have a new support forum up at rhworkshop.com/forums and you can contact us for anything at rhworkshop.com/contact Thanks again for all your support for the IR-Blue project! All of the kits are shipped out to everyone who has filled out the survey. If you have any problems or did not receive a shipment notification please email <email> The Assembled units have started shipping today. It will probably be sometime next week before they are all shipped. Thanks to everyone for being so patient. The first batch of kits will be ready to ship on Friday. The rest will be shipping the middle of next week. The assembled IR-Blue manufacturing has also started and we should be ready to ship those in the 3rd and 4th week of June. Surveys have been sent out to collect shipping addresses, please fill them out so we know where to send the kits and assembled units. For those that are interested in a 2 sensor IR-Blue, we have not been able to figure out a way to offer that at this point. The main problem is a compliance issue. We can not sell an assembled device with 2 sensors without FCC and CE testing it which is around $3500 in this case. The budget getting these made was pretty tight so investing in a 2 sensor version isn't possible yet. We hope to get it sorted out in the future and you will get a special discount / trade in deal when it is available. The IR-Blue passed FCC and CE testing. It will be a week or so before the report and documentation is ready but the testing is done and passed. The IR-Blue iPhone app is now available in the Apple App Store . The Android app is available in the Android Play Store and the .apk file is also available on GitHub if you need it. If you have problems or suggestions for either app you can check existing issues or open a new issue on GitHub for iPhone or Android . Hey everybody, the kits will start assembly in the next 2 weeks. The contract manufacturer will run a couple of boards called a first article and we will then verify that everything looks good and approve the rest of the run. We hope to be shipping kits by the last week of May. The sample run of 100 cases looks good so the production run is in process now. Those should be here within 2 weeks. The assembled units are scheduled for manufacturing the first or second week in June. We hope to be shipping those by the third or fourth week in June. The Android App is available in the Play store and the iOS app is waiting for review and should be available in the Apple App Store soon. We will have a couple of updates this week. First off is the injection molds are done and sample parts are on the way here to be approved. Once they are verified the rest of the cases can be made next week. We are using Protomold for the molds and they were nice enough to take some pictures of the molds for us. Just wanted to post some pictures of the sample cases. The black one is milled out of ABS and is almost exactly like the injection molded ones that will ship with the IR-Blue. The white one is a 3D printed case made by Shapeways with selective laser sintered nylon plastic. . If you are a "PCB Only" backer your reward shipped Wednesday. Kit and Assembled backers hang in there, the parts are on order and the case is almost finalized. The PCBs for the "PCB Only" Backers are here! We hope to have them all in the mail by Wednesday. Hey everyone, just wanted to get a quick update out. We have been gearing up for sending out the PCB backer rewards. The shipping mailers are here, the labels are here and we will soon have them all printed and ready to stuff for when the PCBs show up. We expect those next week and will get them in the mail as soon as possible. In the picture below you can see the testing boards for the different versions. There is the Dual Mode kit version in the top left, the Bluetooth 2 version with two sensors in the top right, the SMT Dual Mode version in the bottom left and the Bluetooth 4 version in the bottom right. The Bluetooth 2 and 4 versions are for PCB Only backers. We have been tweaking the firmwares and ironing out things on the iPhone and Android Apps. For mounting the IR-Blue to phones, tablets or whatever, we will be including a set of small reusable sticky pads that hold really well and leave no residue. They are washable and should last for quite a while. The Kickstarter collections period is over and all but 7 backers were processed successfully, thanks everyone! We have been busy getting the change to Dual Mode Bluetooth finished and ready for production, it has been a lot of work to get things changed for this but the schedule is still on track. The PCB Only backers were sent a survey last week to choose which board they would like and collect shipping information. (If you are not a PCB Only Backer then you do not have to choose anything, you will be getting the Dual Mode Bluetooth IR-Blue. We will wait to collect your shipping information when we are ready to ship since Kickstarter only allows us to send one survey for each backer level.) The PCB Only boards were just ordered from Laen who runs OSH Park , they have an excellent service with great quality boards. The eagle files for the boards are posted on Github and the bill of materials for each will be up there soon. The layout of the board now has room for a second sensor. Marcel tested it and apart from a few small issues it seems to work well. It is at this point an unsupported feature but will be there for people who want to tinker with it. We would just like to say thank you so much for all the support for this project. It was an amazing 30 days and we couldn't have done it without you. We will be sending out surveys for each tier to collect your shipping information and any other information we need. We are going to wait for the 14 days Amazon requires to collect all the payments so we know who has paid and who hasn't. Now to get things moving! Thanks, Andy Rawson RH Workshop LLC The last 24 hours of the IR-Blue Kickstarter are here. We would like to thank everyone for the overwhelming support. It has been simply amazing. If you know anyone else who might want one please let them know that time is running out. We are getting ready for production, some design changes still need to be made and validated but we are moving right along with things. I will be meeting with the Assembly partner on Tuesday to go over the production plans and get things kicked off. Thanks, Andy Rawson RH Workshop LLC Thanks so much for all the support! We are very excited that the stretch goal has been reached. It means harmony between Android and iPhone users, a simpler choice for everyone and a better product overall. (Well maybe not harmony between Android and iPhone users...) We will be updating the project page soon to reflect the change to the Dual Mode Bluetooth model. The next stretch goal We don't have one! There have been some great ideas put out there but nothing that we feel we can actually promise and deliver in a reasonable amount of time. People have been asking for higher resolution for the sensor, it would be great but we can't find a sensor with better resolution that is anywhere near the cost of this one. You could add a lens to change the resolution of the sensor but the IR lenses we have found are more expensive than the cost of the sensor itself. So, if you have a great idea for a stretch goal let us know and we will see if it can be done. PCB Backers If you are a PCB backer the change to a Dual Mode Bluetooth module makes the soldering of the module much harder since the pads are only under the module board. You would need to be comfortable using solder paste and a reflow oven or skillet to mount the module. So, you will have the choice of the Bluetooth 4 only board, the Bluetooth 2 only board or the Dual mode Bluetooth board. The Bluetooth 2 only and the Bluetooth 4 only boards each use a module that can be soldered by hand. You will be able to pick which one you want after the Kickstarter ends. Here is a video of the assembly of a Bluetooth 4 version PCB. <url>
