Hello all, It has been over 18 months since I projected shipping for this campaign. For those International pledges still waiting I can't apologize enough. The wait has been unbelievably and painfully long. But it is finally over. I've wanted to make sure everything was truly moving before false reporting once again. I have confirmation of the preparation and packaging of all remaining pledges. See the photos below, taken at our factory and awaiting pickup to be taken to Hong Kong and shipped. I wanted to post this update some time ago but the final paperwork for customs and export drug on and on. The pitfalls of a startup are many. We've weathered them. I truly thank you all for your enduring support and patience. For those still waiting I am extremely excited to finally get your SHOTBOX in your hands. You should start seeing tracking numbers within the next 7-14 days as the shipping commences. Thank you again. And again. And again. Aaron ______ _____ _____ Hello all, Just a quick update that I've been able to resolve the processing issues at the new provider and shipping will resume this week. Thank you always Aaron Hello all, The difficulties keep mounting as many of you are still awaiting your package. After getting a jump on the remaining international orders with the new carrier I've now had numerous packages returned within the last two weeks. We are down to under 100 to ship but I've had to pause until I can understand why and fix the process. It's much too costly and affects everything. As mentioned in a previous update I have to find a source that is as close as possible to the shipping that was collected, but the average cost is still coming in around $85. I understand the frustration of those still waiting. I'm still here and WILL get your Reward delivered. I once again apologize. It's my least favorite thing in the world because I just want this done. But it's all I can do while still closing this out. Thank you again for your enduring patience and support. Aaron Hello all, We're making progress. European pledges are going out and will be complete by end of next week. Asian and Pacific Area orders through Hong Kong are closer, and fulfillment should also begin by the end of next week. My sincere goal is that all orders be complete by Christmas. Thank you all so much, Aaron Hello all, All pledges to Canada have been shipped at this point. Many may still be en route but please message me or email me at <email> if you haven't received yours or seen any tracking emails come your way. I'm made progress on the European front as well, down to about 30 more to fulfill. The Asian, Pacific and Australian pledges are still pending, though I should have confirmation from the carrier on pricing and fees within the next week. I will update that status as soon as I know. Thanks for sticking with me on all this. We're getting there. Aaron Hello all, Over 800 of you have your Pledge. 150 of you scattered around the globe don't. I've neglected communication until I had knowledge of the necessary solution. I apologize for the lag. You deserve better. I would never have expected to be one year later and that a good number of you are still waiting. This is all on me. It's been an unbelievable year of ups and downs. Everything a start-up stands for and incredibly long hours keeping everything afloat. There's a reason most start-ups fail, but we've made it this far and will complete this campaign. I won't go into full depth of the obvious tailspin but you deserve to know the key elements. It started slipping a year ago when the timeline went forward 2+ months and we barely made it on the boat. It's been catch up ever since and unforeseen roadblocks at every step, it seems. Many campaigns fail to get out of the manufacturing. That wasn't our issue. It was shipping and the inordinate difficulty and expense of moving a somewhat heavy and bulky product around the world. That's all part of the business. I've learned the hard way, and unfortunately at some of your expense. Cutting to reality, the core problem is that I didn't calculate nor collect enough for international shipping so I have been having to make it up from other sources. I've been overpaying, often more than double what was collected, to do so. Amidst the other hurdles, this all hit a wall about 3 months ago when a number of loan sources didn't come through. I've been scrambling and clawing and putting anything personally I have on the table to make up the difference. It's finally come together, but the only way that I can complete everyone's orders around the world is getting these last Pledges shipped from the China factory. I have worked a deal there to get the product configured, released and processed direct out of Hong Kong. The shipping to the remaining addresses is at least closer to the original fees collected. In this way, I can manage ALL of the remaining pledges with the additional funds that I've now been able to secure. The drawback is that this process will still take a number of weeks. I don't know exactly yet, but I will commit a weekly update to each of the remaining Backers with exactly where it is all at. I'm sorry for this but I'm doing all that I physically and mentally can, and won't quit. The exception to the above solution is any Backers in Canada. US-based shipping is best due to proximity. We resumed shipping to there two weeks ago and will finish this week. I apologize deeply for the delays and difficulties, and can't adequately express my thanks, but we're alive, kicking and not relegated to the belly-up category just yet...or ever. Thank you sincerely, Aaron Hello all, I'm very happy to announce that shipping will resume early next week. All the pieces are back in stock and we can finally make the final push to get everyone fulfilled. I've kept track of everyone that has contacted me or commented to verify you are still in the queue, but we'll be extra careful to make sure we get everything right before shipping out the door. It's been very tricky with the international orders, both with the cost and strange delivery attempts to some of the countries. We don't want anything coming back. Thank you so much for your unending patience and support. Aaron Hello all, This is a hard update to write since it will address even more delays. I'm embarrassed that this campaign has been so challenging. We are down to about 100 international orders to process but have run into an issue with the inventory for backdrops, magnets, and the Kickstarter Choice Print set. In the transition from one shipping service to another, the cases ended up in limbo. I was notified about two weeks ago and have been digging into it since, assuming that we would locate them. We haven't yet and I don't want to just hope they show up. I've ordered enough reprints and magnets and am air-freighting backdrops from China. This has been messy and one curve after another. I'm so sorry for you who have not gotten your product yet. I'm still committed to completing this. If you are a U.S. Backer and haven't received your box yet, please let me know or if you are international and just want to check in to make sure it's still in the queue. Thank you again for your patience and support. Aaron Hello all, This is a great day for U.S. orders, but only partially so for international. Barring a few loose remnants that we'll find, all the U.S. domestic orders have been shipped! If you are reading this and still haven't gotten yours or any recent in-transit tracking emails just let me know via Kickstarter PM or my email at <email>. International orders are being packed for transit to a facility in Pennsylvania that I've finally found that can flat rate anywhere in the world. They are the most optimal for both volume costs as well as customs clearance. It's been a very big wild west for this and I'm grateful to finally have the right solution. I wish I had them from the get-go. This area was NOT what I would have expected to be the most difficult. And I'm very thankful for the patience worldwide. I appreciate the constant support and encouragement that I receive from you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you find anything amiss or have questions. Aaron Hello all, I'm so happy to announce that we are around 80% fulfilled now of all the U.S. orders. The shift to a new warehouse and shipping was completely the right move. Intense, but right. I'm confident that we will be 100% by the end the next week. So if you haven't seen some processing emails lately please private message me and I'll make sure your order is still live. I worry about any slipping through this whole process. International is still the challenge. We're still getting reports of customs whoa's. We can't control what the different countries do. All we can do is declare a low, yet believable value ($50) that doesn't raise eyebrows too much or flag the package. Since each country has their own processes and fees we're all at their mercy on this. And it's so varied. We're just a significantly sized and weighted package so the process is more involved, it seems. A way to soften it is to freight forward palettes of product into the areas with more orders and have the local carriers take it from there. The drawback is more time. I'm looking at Australia, Canada and the EU for these solutions. I'm also still trying to pull new product out of China to Hong Kong for Asian distribution. I'm just still at the factory with that but should have some released product within the next few weeks. It doesn't make sense to air freight back over from the U.S. to Hong Kong, Taiwan, and closer countries when we can truck it over the border soon. Hindsight would have yielded much better results and I apologize for that. So all of you on the international front, I so appreciate your time and patience. It's not just getting it to you for close to the shipping cost we collected, it's getting the least cost impact on your receiving end as we can. But please contact me as needed. We're making progress. Thanks again for all of your support and patience, Aaron Hello all, I've officially fired and moved our warehousing and shipping service. The processing has been unbearably slow and I've found out this week of other issues with their business that has hindered ours. They've also been throttling and delaying us behind other accounts as well. It's unacceptable, of course. We will restart shipping early next week (including Memorial Day) as enough product moves to the new facility. It will be key to have more direct control. Even with the problems we're about 60% fulfilled on domestic and Canada. We've improved a bit on international, but I've needed to give those orders a better solution and have finally partnered with an acceptable service out of Hong Kong. I truly expect domestic will now crank forward, and international will follow. I apologize deeply for all those of you that still haven't received your product. Please know that I am still on this 100%. Thank you so much for your patience and support. Aaron Hello all great backers, We are trudging away. On the U.S. domestic front, we have shipped about 45% of the orders. I'm not as far on the international side. We've shipped only around 20%. I'm trying to consolidate the geographic areas that we have greater amounts going so we're not just shipping ala carte. This is combined with finding best how we prep the parcel to avoid excess customs charges on the recipient side. Those seem to be all over the place. As you know, I've struggled to find adequate solutions here. Contributing leads and suggestions from choice backers in specific areas have been very helpful. I appreciate the many supportive messages, comments and emails that have come. And I love hearing the unboxing ones. We're gearing up for a good push next week, and more traction on international. Thanks so much for your patience and support. Have a wonderful weekend. With appreciation, Aaron Hello all backers, An update is overdue, and I am still trying to catch up with personal messages and comments from a handful of you. I apologize once again for delays in response but will strive to be caught up soon. I need to give you a comprehensive update of where SHOTBOX and all of its components are at. So this one will be a bit longer. We are still plugging away with fulfillment, but as indicated in the past, it is still pretty messy and slower than desired. The fulfillment house has been a challenge, but I don't blame them entirely. The campaign itself has done so well that it is caused a back up in the flow between us and other clients of theirs. However, that is only a weak excuse. I am doing what I can to continue that as quickly as possible, but it is the little things that have added up, such as running out of the cover prints for the Print packages. We opened up remaining boxes from the factory and found that the guide sheet was missing. We needed to hurry and print more up and get them put in. That delayed us a couple of days. Again, these are only excuses and ultimately still on me. Also, I have received and fulfilled many requests for more time-sensitive needs, based upon the invite in previous updates. While I have tried to respect and accommodate those, I have also been trying to balance getting the early backers out first. I need to focus more on that first-in-first-out process. I will still consider urgent requests but can only do so much out of respect for those that came in earlier than others. On the international side, it is been far more consuming and difficult than I imagined and planned for. I am still trying to find a more appropriate solution that focuses on international from the China location but have struggled with finding sources that would support our smaller start-up size. So I have been filling the orders from the States. However, in many cases the cost of shipping these out is over double what was projected on Kickstarter, hitting $120+. That is not your fault in the least. This is still my responsibility, even if it eats into remaining profit on that order. We also have had many reports of customs being charged on the receiver side, and I don't know exactly the details of how that works. But because that incurs more fees for the backer, in some cases $80 or more, it is a significant problem for orders in those countries. Overall I simply need to find a better solution for international costs and shipping. I will continue to ship the international orders as quickly as I can, regardless of the cost. On a side note, and to help with better communication of the Kickstarter campaign, you will start to see more coming from Debra, my assistant and manager over Customer Service. Now I want to be more transparent and open towards what is going on with SHOTBOX as a business. I have received much support from so many of you that have been in similar situations of trying to get a start-up off the ground. I have been doing entrepreneurial businesses for the past 25 years, and have had many ups and downs. I am extremely confident in our success for SHOTBOX, but this one has been a bigger challenge than any of the others for me., largely because I needed manufactured products to start the ball rolling to the rest of the product line, which will include software and services. The roadmap of SHOTBOX is very healthy and promising, but because of the magnitude of keeping inventory in stock, I just simply need to continue to raise capital. Please note that your orders are not at risk. We have set aside all of what is spoken for. We have already run out of stock three times in the past and it kills all of our momentum. So to be transparent, much of my focus over the last two months has been in preparing the company and materials for a seed round. By any means, I don't lessen my responsibility to fulfill my Kickstarter obligations to you, but I also need to be able to inject fuel and life into the company to continue to get lift. SHOTBOX has received a good amount of initial capital from myself, friends and family at the beginning of this business, but I find it an extremely different game when it comes to angel-level money. Even though we are a success when it comes to bringing a product to market, it seems that most of the angels that I talk with are more interested in software and services instead of hard goods, even though that is part of our future. I have received interest in more what I consider base-hit amounts and it raises the question of a potential crowdfund for equity campaign. In a very big way, we are a crowdfunding company. It's the whole reason we've gotten this far. So it's very interesting and appealing to continue to do so, even though it is unorthodox in the angel community and adds potential complexity to future rounds. To seriously consider this direction I want to address the possibility of interest from this group of supporters. The benefit of turning to the crowd is that it opens the door for an opportunity to be involved with the potential ROI of a start-up that is usually only available to sophisticated investors. It is a high risk, but also a potential of high return. So to gauge interest of potential participation in a future campaign, I would love your feedback in this following short survey. This will help me consider this overall direction. I'd love to have this way succeed. It would be a great story of start-up success in this world of crowd, angel and "shark" investing. For securities law and compliance reasons, please note that this does NOT constitute an offering or terms definition. It is only a feedback survey. <url>| Perfect Posture Instantly Effortlessly align, support and strengthen posture. Relieve neck, back and shoulder pain with the most advanced wearable solution!

CLICK HERE Hello all, I apologize for the delay in getting everyone updated on our progress. We've experienced our fair share of bumps and curves with getting setup at the warehouse. We had switched our shipping and cart software over the last month and the dump from Kickstarter didn't quite go as smoothly as we hoped. Anyways, those problems aren't excuses. We're working away. We've gotten about 30% of orders processed so far, but have now been able to pick up more steam and are getting in the flow. We're averaging 50-75 a day so it will still take us some time to get them all out since we started out with over 950 awesome orders. What I would like to offer is that if any of you need it right away, please contact me (via KS or <email>) and I'll take that request into the flow. I know many of you are waiting with specific needs and I would like to accommodate as much as I can. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I really appreciate your patience. Always. Aaron Hello all, That pic above is a scene of beauty. It's our second container...the one that ended up with all the PANELS and Prints product. Our first one unloaded Monday and PANELS wasn't part of the load. The 2nd container got in town and we got it unloaded last night. PANELS and all. My paperwork had those reversed and somehow the containers played leap frog. But it's in, onboarded to the warehouse software and now we can start getting it out the door Monday. We will start at the front of the line with those Pledges that came in first. I'm gonna tell ya that I'm impressed with this generation of the SHOTBOX. The previous ones have been awesome but the full 2.0 is worth the wait. It's tighter and more durable, has better reflection and glare control, and just a bit more polished. It was worth the wait and I appreciate everyone's patience and support, especially over the last 2 months of waiting. On the international front, what I thought was a slam dunk with fulfillment out of Hong Kong just simply turns out a bust. I've shifting to a handful of other prospects but nothing has stuck yet and I'm working with the factory for better outbound solutions straight from them, but they're not a pick and pull fulfillment service so it's taking more time. I will start fulfilling from our US operations in the meantime. We have over 1000 amazing orders to fulfill overall and will do them as quickly as we can, but it will take the course of a week or two, I think. That's a lot of product to manhandle and get out the door. See below for some more beautiful warehouse glamour shots. Once again, thank you for your marathon support.

It will be dropped off next Friday and loaded by the following Monday. It's later than I ever intended it to shift to but we're nearly there. We've been up against the end-of-year and pre Chinese New Year crunch that everyone is trying to beat, but our factory continues to give us a ton of focus and do everything they can. I'm up late with them every night making sure it's all flowing as smoothly as possible. It's amazing the logistics it takes to get all the way through manufacturing and move stuff around the world. It's nerve- racking, but I love all of this challenge. My wife says I'm nuts. Not much defense to that, I concede. I've set up non-North American shipping to come out of Hong Kong. This is good news for all those international Pledgers. I'm not sure exactly the dates on these but the product should be at the fulfillment house within 2 weeks. See below for the pics of the final PANELS and Prints products. I'm getting some more photos of the frenzy the factory is currently in and will post those in the next update.

I will be sending them out today. They will be coming from Backerkit so be looking for those. We use Backerkit to help manage the fulfillment process as well as offer additional accessories and products that are part of our SHOTBOX system. So take a look at some of the pieces that we are introducing there. The second item is an update on the magnet portion of the Reward. I've been struggling with finding an overall source of the rare earth magnets as well as really finding them difficult to use. The samples that I've brought in are generally too strong to pull apart and frustrating to manipulate with fingertips. And they chip fairly easily. I thought the square ones would be better, but not too much as it turns out. Even worse on the chipping. So a few weeks ago I set out to find a better solution and fell in love with the magnets shown above. They are a Hematite polished magnet rock. They don't chip, are strong and extremely easy to manipulate. I've made the call to switch our reward to a bag of 12 of these, rather than the 8 indicated in the campaign. I hope this doesn't upset anyone but it really is a better solution and fits into the budget I had for this part. I was able to increase the count to 12 for everyone. I think you'll like them. This will be the last update before the Christmas weekend. I wish everyone a wonderful holiday season. May it be warm and peaceful.

See the pics below. I'm very pleased on how they've turned out. These are close to full production and I needed to get some feedback to the factory. There's some final tweaking that will make them easier to use. I love these things. I also opted to add a protective carry sleeve for the Print sets. See those pics below as well. It added some cost but I felt it necessary, especially as we expand into other sets that we can offer. Speaking of that...part of the survey will include a few more Print sets. I've gotten the artwork in for that as well and am excited to show you those. I travel to Oakland tomorrow for a quick day trip with my software engineer, and then will send out the surveys on Wednesday. Be looking for them coming from Backerkit.com.

CLICK HERE Hello all, I need to give you an update of where everything is at. The process has slowed down more than I'd like. Our factory is great and fully engaged but it's just extremely busy for them as well, and the holiday season is starting to push back on us too. Even though we are definitely high priority it's just taking longer for all the pieces to come in from suppliers, assembly to finish, and then get things into containers to move around the world. We're still working on a Hong Kong fulfillment center for all international orders. We feel that product should hit there the first part of January and get out the door. That means that we're pushing the end of January for full product to hit the U.S. shore. We're setting up a fulfillment center in California to accelerate getting it out to each of you. Now, that all said, I know some of you were counting on this for a Christmas gift. If that is the case, I can't bear the thought of that not happening if I have any control over it. I have a very limited supply of SHOTBOX bundles WITHOUT the PANELS kit that I can ship next week for Christmas emergencies. I will then need to send the PANELS later. Please let me know if you're in a bind with this. You can email me directly at <email> as well as through Kickstarter. IMPORTANT: There are some improvements to the 2.0 box that is coming from China. That is the overall reason for the need of the full shipment being built right now to fulfill to all of you. For those needing it for Christmas, I'll send a couple of pieces with the PANELS Kit that you'll need to install yourself to bring the box up to speed. I just wanted to make sure you know that the box that you Pledged for is improved in some areas over what we still have left on the website itself, most notably a black ceiling that helps reduce or eliminate reflection off glass or shiny materials for top-down shooting. Thanks all for your ongoing support, patience and enthusiasm. Be looking for the survey early next week. We'll start collecting all the needed info.

CLICK HERE Hello all, I first traveled to Shanghai for a trade show there and found some great stuff that I will share at a later date I then relocated last weekend to our factory in Dongguan. Our guys here are amazing. They are always hard working, earnest, effective and excited to work. We're still on track to start shipping in December but I can honestly say that we won't get them all out the door by the end. It will trail into January. In part, it's because this campaign did so well. I can honestly admit that I thought we'd only have 500-600 Pledges. But we ended with nearly 1000. What a great problem to have, but we're scrambling to make up the difference. It's very close. I feel good about that. But I wish I was more certain of how many we'll actually get out the door by the end of the month. Here is the current schedule, barring anything we can't anticipate right now: 1- We are setting up International (non-U.S.) Pledges to be fulfilled out of Hong Kong. This will allow us to hit our December delivery for international. 2- We will have limited product available to start fulfilling U.S. based Pledges in December. We'll crank out as many as we can based upon the order when the Pledges came in. 3- The PANELS and Prints product is looking good for completion within 3 weeks. We've been pounding on final design and prototypes and I should have a production sample by this weekend. See below for some pics from the factory. All in all, we're in great position and literally working day and night. I love this stuff. I'm so excited to get it all in your hands. And I'm giddy to see what's coming down the pipe for 2017. But more on that another time. :-) Thanks so much for all of your support and backing. This doesn't happen without each of you. Aaron Check out these other campaigns that I love!

I will be finishing up the touches needed for the SHOTBOX all well as finish out the PANELS extension. We've been working toward a source in U.S. to fulfill our domestic pledges, as well as one at our factory to fulfill international. It's going well and we're pleased with what we see. The PANEL is simple, very rigid, with a full magnetic sheet on the back portion. This can be flipped around to have the magnet on the floor instead. It will most likely be black or charcoal on the outside to show less fingerprinting and such. I'll be sending out another update regarding the artwork winners for the 12 Prints. I'm excited to finish that part and get the printing going. Thanks so much for all of your support and enthusiasm. Aaron Hello all amazing backers, In the spirit of the World Series, I would say that you all helped deliver a massively incredible Grand Slam for SHOTBOX. I'm still basking. I woke up this morning still glowing. Words aren't adequate. We haven't let up with development and production at all. We've opened up another build at the factory and I'll be heading that direction within a few weeks. Things are snapping along. We'll keep updates coming. So thank you, thank you, thank you.

In fact, we blew by it over the weekend and are fast approaching $70k. The first stretch was a set of square magnets. I've found these easier to manipulate and use, especially for thicker materials. These will be added to all Pledge levels (except the Chuck-A-Buck). We're getting close to a new prototype for PANELS. We've been scrambling a bit with the sourcing but are working on doing as much in-house as we can. It's coming together quickly and is still on track. Thanks again for your support and backing.
