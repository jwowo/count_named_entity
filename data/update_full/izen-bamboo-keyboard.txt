Thanks again to everyone for your amazing support! We hope you had a wonderful Easter or Passover weekend. One of our backers made a great comment (Thanks Tom!) about increasing your pledge to receive additional keyboards. If you would like another keyboard for a friend or family member, you can add $85 to your pledge, or add $100 for a keyboard and stand, or $15 for a stand. We are so thankful for all the great press we’ve seen over the last few weeks. Here are a few of our favorite quotes: “it’s a revolutionary concept capable of really changing the course of business history.” <url>“The keyboard is a step forward in electronics make-up.” <url>“Figure this to be a fairly common workplace addition, as people configure their cubicles for better feng shui, what could be better than the alluring beauty of bamboo?” <url>“Don’t you want to help starving children on the moon by switching away from nasty plastic keyboards?” <url>“Its slim design and natural look set it apart from many keyboards, and the bamboo can stand up to vigorous typing” <url>“It’s recyclable and lightweight, but that doesn’t mean it’s not durable. Bamboo fibers are notoriously tough.” We made it to our goal this morning! Thank you sooooo much for contributing your support and helping us spread the word. Words cannot express our sincere appreciate and gratitude. We couldn't have done it without you! Be on the lookout for a request for your mailing address which will be sent via email after the funding period is over in 12 days. With the help of a private loan, we have already begun producing more keyboards and are hoping to be able to send your rewards earlier than June. We are aiming for mid May and will keep you posted! Thanks again for helping us make this happen! Robin and Ryan Hey everyone! Thank you so much for supporting our project. We are really excited about the progress we've made so far. We still have a long way to go, so please help us spread the word! We have some good news to share- based on feedback from our graphic designer friends, we are changing the logo on the keyboard. Check out the new logo and please let us know what you think...
