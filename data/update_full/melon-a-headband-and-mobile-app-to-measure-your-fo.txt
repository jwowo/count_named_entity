Hey Backers, Hope all is well! This update is focused on timeline and how we’re approaching problems. Some info on remaining orders: When your headband is processed in our warehouse an email is sent to you with your order number and tracking information. This email is standardized from our warehouse and is sent automatically. So, if you have not received this email yet, your order is still in our warehouse, soon to get processed and shipped. Shipping has taken longer than we thought in part because it has been more expensive than expected, so we’ve made sure to improve our shipping methods to be more cost-effective and to ensure that all Kickstarter units will be shipped and Melon can continue to provide support and grow. Now that we have some more of the kinks worked out (although certainly not all of them), we expect shipping speed to pick back up next week and the following. Our top priorities are making sure that everyone gets their Melon and that the team can continue to improve the product and provide support once everything is all shipped. Delivery schedule: As of today, we feel confident that all units will be shipped in the next 20 days. Once we’re done shipping all of the orders, we will be sure to announce that to all of you. So, it’s going to be an exciting and busy 20 days for the Melon team. And as mentioned in our last update, we’ll also be working on improving communication, transparency, and support during that time and afterwards. Android: As we mentioned in a previous update, while the Android app is not currently ready for release, the Melon team is hard at work finishing it and preparing it for launch. We have enlisted extra support specifically around Android to make this launch happen. The Android app has been our most requested item and with that in mind, we are working to release it as quickly as possible. We’ve asked this new Android team to provide us with an estimated launch date for us to post in our next update on Wednesday, January 25th. iPhone4S and iPad compatibility: This is developed and will be launched in the next version of our iOS app, which we are submitting to Apple next week (in 4-5 days). Happy weekend to all of you, and we’ll be in touch soon. All the best, The Melon Team Hey Melon Kickstarter backers! It's Melon mass production and shipment time! We have accepted all testing that we previously mentioned: production of 100 units (tested, found some issues, and fixed), and production of 500 units (tested, all looking good) and are now in mass production for all of your units (2,723). Packaging is finalized, signal quality is stable, the app is in an exciting stage, Android will ready, and our researcher and developer platform is in good shape! Now it's just a matter of completing mass production, shipping your units, and making sure all the software is live. We hope that everyone has updated their shipping addresses, but if you have not, now is the last chance to do so. You can do this via your Kickstarter account, or you can message us directly via Kickstarter. Also, once all of the headbands are shipped, we will transition our communication with all of you to email, so please make sure that we have your preferred email address. This is also important for receiving your tracking number! It has been a very long path to get here. It has not been easy. It is still not easy, and we are working through weekends and day/night to build this product and company. The fact that you are all still here, supporting us, caring about us, and understanding the effort it takes for a small team of 5 to build an amazing product is what keeps us going and truly means so much to us. Also, a nice surprise - the team recently found out that we were named a Fast Company Design Award Finalist in 2014 for the Health Category, check it out and tweet about it here: Melon Fast Co Design Award . Also, a few nice pictures of Melon in action :) All the best, Arye, Laura, and the Melon Team *This update contains information only on our SDK and researcher/developer tools. An update on shipping will be posted next week.* Hello Developers, First, I would like to say that it’s been almost a year since I joined the Melon team, and I am very excited to be so close to launching our software (and, of course, delivering the Melon hardware). I was really excited about the opportunity to join Melon, because I love building technology that has awesome potential to improve people’s day to day lives. The last year has been filled with amazing times and incredibly challenging, exciting, and fulfilling work. We all appreciate your patience as we’ve worked so hard on the product. In order to get our app out by the time we start shipping, we have pushed the first launch of the SDK to Wednesday, June 11th. We have been using the SDK to create our mobile app and have worked during our development process to pull out the most useful and exciting parts of what we’ve built to put them into the SDK to be accessible to our developer community. Over the last few months, we have also built a graphical UI research/developer platform that will be made available around the same time as the SDK, because we believe this will be an important tool to many who want to build things and perform research with the Melon headband. Here’s more info the on the SDK and research/developer platform: Melon’s SDK (internally known as the MPlatformKit) is built to provide a set of tools that allow you to establish a connection with the Melon headband, read EEG data streams from both channels of the Melon headband (left and right hemisphere prefrontal cortex), control different EEG classifiers (our first algorithms will be for focus, stress levels, hemispheric correlation, and blink detection), applying filters to raw data (FFT, band pass, etc.), and requesting specific filters (alpha, beta, theta, delta, gamma). Additionally, the SDK supports seamless multiplexing of multiple headbands and devices in real time, providing you with a pretty simple way to create complex applications and perform research with data from a group of people. We’ve built the SDK to be accessible to a wide range of developers and researchers, from those familiar with EEG and who want the raw data packets, in all of their noisy glory, to those who prefer filtered data showing cleaner signals or classified data such as focus scores. Classified data will be displayed on normalized scales (e.g. 1-10), which will allow you to create apps that use this linear scale as a controller or measurement that drives action in the app. The Melon SDK will require you to sign up on our website for full access and register for an SDK key for each application you build. The Melon developer/researcher platform will act as a graphical user interface that allows for EEG data recordings, visual manipulation of filters, data to text file exporting, visualization via spectrogram, and classification analyses (e.g. blink detection). This platform is flexible and will allow for developers and researchers to create custom modules that can be placed into the platform with just a few lines of code. Our hope is that this platform will easily extend into whatever research and/or development tool you need. Compatibility: iOS - Done Mac - 95% Windows - In development, will be in V.2 update Android - In development, will be in V.2 update If any developers have suggestions, comments, or just want to offer us help :), please message us or email us at <email>! All the best, Eric, Arye, Laura, and The Melon Team Hi Backers! We are sending you this super quick update to let you know that later this year we will be sponsoring an epic hackathon in Los Angeles with our friends from OpenBCI! Details will be announced at a later date, and, of course, all of you will receive an invite! OpenBCI ( currently live on Kickstarter ) believes in giving everyone access to high-quality brainwave data and has created a customizable and fully open brain-computer interface platform. Melon totally stands behind their mission, and therefore is teaming up with the folks there to create an awesome experience for developers, hackers, and everyone interested in working on meaningful EEG projects. We showed our support by purchasing one of their ‘Hackathon’ levels, and wanted to share their campaign with all of you before it ends on Wednesday, January 22, at 8:00pm EST. If you love what Conor and Joel are doing as much as we do, please share their campaign and/or support it, if you can! All the best, Arye and Laura Hey Kickstarter Backers! We wanted to update you on what the last few weeks have been like at Melon! When we have news regarding an updated delivery schedule, you will all be the first to know. Until then, here’s some of what we’ve been working on: Software Because we won’t be there to guide you through your first Melon experience, we’ve been designing the app to teach you how to use Melon. This includes learning how to connect the headband, navigate through the app, start a monitoring session, play the origami game, and more! We’re making sure that everything is as intuitive as possible to use, so that your training period is short and you can jump right into enjoying Melon. Headband The hardware is getting closer and closer to its final design. Lately, we’ve been testing different manufacturing processes before finalizing our tooling. This is so we can be certain that when we make thousands of Melons they come out with the same detail as our prototypes. We’ve also been working a lot on our packaging design and making it functional and reusable. Melon Labs As we get closer to the production of our headbands, we have been engaging with doctors, researchers, and our advisors to think about how we can create research studies using Melon. There is a lot of desire to see what EEG data looks like in situations where that type of data has never been captured. Melon’s comfortable and sleek design makes it an enticing research tool to many. Growing the Company We’ve been growing the team and will begin introducing all of the new Melon-heads soon! Thank you all so much for your amazing support over the last few months while we have been working to build our dream project, the Melon platform. We love all of the awesome feedback that you send our way, and it’s truly awesome to see your enthusiasm for Melon! All the best, The Melon Team Greetings from the Melon Team! The Melon team recently received the first batch of designed-for-manufacture headbands. That means we’ve been busy testing and finalizing the hardware before purchasing the custom tools that will be used to build all of the devices ordered on Kickstarter. As we close in on the final design, here is some of the Melon team’s daily to-do list: • Building and testing the Melon mobile app. • Creating the API for Melon developers. The developer docs will become available several weeks before delivery of the headband. • Rigorous testing of the headband’s electronic design, firmware, Bluetooth reliability, battery life, and industrial design. • Developing the Melon website and web dashboard for data analytics, downloads, and storage. • Growing the Melon team. We’re adding outstanding people to the team to help us make Melon even more awesome! As you all know, we have made several big and exciting changes to the headband since we launched the product on Kickstarter, thanks to all of your insightful suggestions during the campaign. A couple of the larger changes included adjustability and the incorporation of a 3-axis accelerometer. At the time we launched Melon on Kickstarter, we did our best to predict an accurate delivery timeframe. Unfortunately, it has taken longer than expected to incorporate the new components and headband design into our manufacturing process, so we have to push back the scheduled delivery date since. The team at Melon apologizes for any inconveniences caused by this change. More details about our updated schedule will be posted soon. If you have any questions, please send us a message and we will do our best to provide you with a prompt response. We can also be reached at <email>. All the best, The Melon Team Hey Backers! Preparing to manufacture the Melon headbands is going great. We’ve sourced all of the components, finalized the electrical and mechanical designs, and, most importantly, figured out the best way to make the headbands adjustable. The #1 question we received from all of you was, “Will the headband be adjustable?” So, we spent a lot of time working to make that possible without sacrificing the industrial design (style of the headband). Below, check out some pictures from the design process: Each headband will come with 5 interchangeable units (XS, S, M, L, and XL). Melon headbands will now be able to comfortably fit most people, ages 10 and up. Also, with 5 sizes, Melon headbands will be even more secure during activities requiring movement, such as yoga or other exercise. Now, we are going through a process called RFQ, or request for quotation. Basically, we’re just finalizing which factory is going to be making your Melons! Once that is complete, we will be testing our production lines with a couple runs of approximately 100 headbands. Check out this article about our process so far: <url>’t wait to see how you help us create a platform that is powerful and informative to all of our end users. Stay tuned for updates on our test runs! We love you guys &amp; thanks for all the support :) All the best, The Melon Team Hello backers! Thanks for waiting patiently for our latest update on Melon. The first news I wanted to share was that thanks to all of your support on Kickstarter, ESPN's award ceremony called "The ESPYs" thought our product was so cool that they featured it in this years VIP gift bag for the athletes and celebrities that attended. We were really excited about this opportunity! Now, here's the product update: 1) The software is coming along great, and our ability to generate insights about your focus is becoming more and more refined every day. 2) Headband sizing: We have designed what we think is the best possible solution for allowing the headband to fit any head size, while still keeping the sleek design of the Melon headband. We are really excited about this decision, and once the design for manufacture of this part is finished we will be well on our way towards tooling, the next big step in production! (We'll also share some pictures in our next update) 3) Lastly, Melon took a trip to NY last week and tested one of our new features. The location mapping of all the places you use Melon, and tagging of your average focus. Check it out: Thanks for all the support and we've been working really hard so look for some bigger updates in the next few weeks!! All the best, The Melon Team! Hey Backers, Here's what we've been up to since the Kickstarter ended: Meeting with our manufacturers We're all so excited to start manufacturing thousands of Melons. Finalizing our manufacturing contracts and converting our prototype manufacturing setup to one suitable for larger scale takes time and careful planning. We've been working with our team to set this up and start assembling a few smaller test batches. Finalizing headband sizing One of our most important challenges as we go through the manufacturing process is designing our headbands to fit different head sizes. We have spent a lot of time over the last couple of weeks testing different materials, finalizing the industrial design, and creating manufacturing tools that will make the headband size flexible and able to fit many head sizes while staying true to the design of the headband. Creating new games for Melon On the software side, we've been creating new games for the Melon app so that you'll have plenty of fun ways to wear Melon and train your focus when you get the product. We're really excited about this feature and everyone in the office is addicted to the game we call "Focus Birds." Check it out: Thanks! The Melon team is hard at work to deliver an amazing experience. We will continue to update you on the important moments of the process as we work towards delivering your Melon to you. If you have any questions or comments, you can always reach out and send us a message on Kickstarter! All the best, The Melon Team PS: Check out how Melon looks with Google Glass, worn by Co-Founder Arye Barnehama. Hey Backers, Wow! The whole Melon team is thrilled by how awesome the Kickstarter experience has been. THANK YOU SO MUCH to all of you who supported us and are helping turn our dream into a reality. Also, thank you to all of you who shared Melon with your friends and family! Your help growing the campaign was amazing. We received $290,941 from 2,732 backers , an overwhelming show of support for our company! Our goal is to make the invisible activity of the mind visible and to help people understand themselves better in their everyday life. With your support we can now launch our first product that helps people understand and improve their focus! We can also launch the SDK to grow the Melon platform. As you know, we lowered our stretch goal to $300K in the final few hours of the campaign. Since we almost made it, we have decided to go forward and build the web dashboard , hopefully in time for delivery! Next for Melon: Please stay tuned to our updates over the next few months for important news about the product! Also, we will also be sending you a survey to finalize what colors you want, what size , what address you want the headbands shipped to, as well as other details. This will likely be sent out in the next few weeks as we finalize the production plans! Thank you again for being such an awesome community behind Melon; we love you all! All the best, The Melon Team Melon backers and friends, We're so close to the end of this amazing campaign. We wanted to thank all of you for your support!! This is the last offer of the Melon campaign but if we reach $300k we will add the Melon web dashboard for larger scale analysis of Melon data. That means for those awake for the next 6 hours you can help by: -adding $5 to your pledge to get Melon stickers. -adding $40 to your pledge to get the limited edition Melon poster. -or share Melon with someone you think will be interested. The support we have gotten has been more than amazing and we cannot wait to deliver to all of you the amazing product we believe Melon is! All the best, The Melon Team Hey Everyone! Exciting news! As a team, we have decided to lower our latest stretch goal to $300,000 for the web backend. We need your help to make this happen! Please take a couple of minutes tonight and ask a friend to support the project! Thank you so much for supporting us! All the best, The Melon Team Hey Backers! Over here at Melon, we can't believe that there are less than 24 hours left in our campaign. Thank you again to all of you - we are so excited by all of your support and enthusiasm! Help us finish strong! Please click the link below to tweet and let people know that today is the last day to order a Melon on Kickstarter. <url>’s time to announce our final stretch goal: a web dashboard! The Melon web dashboard will have analyses and visualizations of your historical data and personal trends, all designed to provide you with as much insight as possible. Our goal for this is $350,000 on Kickstarter. We have one week left, so please help us spread the word. Help us out by liking Melon on Facebook! <url>’re halfway through our campaign and amazed that we’re so close to reaching our stretch goal! It's time for a big push, can we get to $200k by the end of the week? Announcing the new Melon Pledge Level: For $500, get 4 Melon headbands and special office hours with the Melon team via phone or Skype to support project/research/development setup... or just to chat :) All the best, The Melon Team Today at 3:18pm PST Melon reached its funding goal on Kickstarter. Thank you again to all of our amazing backers! Reaching 100% of our funding goal will allow the team to manufacture and deliver the headband, mobile app, and developer package to our backers! Based on your feedback, the Melon team has a few ideas for features we'd like to add to the Melon. The first addition that we'd like to add to the Melon headband is an accelerometer . Although it would cost more money for the team to develop, an accelerometer would allow the headband to measure physical activity . A number of unique insights could be drawn from correlating movement data with brainwave data. The accelerometer would also provide another source of data for Melon developers. We are setting a stretch goal of $200k to add a accelerometer to the Melon headband, based on our estimates for the additional development required. If you support this goal, please help us share the word: Tweet about Melon Like Melon on Facebook Also, check out the awesome video discussing Melon on Mashable . Thank you again to everyone for all the support! It truly inspires us to hear all of your kind words about Melon. All the best, The Melon Team Melon passed 100% funded mark a few moments ago. The team will be sending out a more in-depth update this evening, but we wanted to take a moment and say a huge thanks to all of our backers! This is a really special moment for the team and we owe it all to you! All the best, The Melon Team First and foremost, we'd like to give a big thanks to our backers . We can't believe that we are already over halfway funded, and we are so grateful for all of your support.
