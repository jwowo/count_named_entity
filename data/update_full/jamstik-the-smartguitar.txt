Talk to you soon! -Matt &amp; the Jamstik+ Team Hey Everyone, JamTutor is Ready to Play! We are happy to announce that the JamTutor update has been approved on the App store! We apologize for any confusion for those who have previously tried to connect, but this update adds official support for the jamstik+. Here is a video showing you how to connect your jamstik+ to jamTutor. Alternatively, if you're connected through the jamstik+ app, jamTutor will recognize your device. Now, let's get learning! New Firmware is live! The next time you open up the jamstik+ app, you'll notice that a firmware update is available. As previously mentioned, this update provides a lot of great performance tweaks, adds beta hammer-on / pull-offs (accessible via the settings menu) a few custom tunings, and more. For a full update list, check out this article . Remember that updating can take up to 15 minutes, but it's definitely worth doing! Please watch the video below which explains best practices for updating your firmware. <url>"any color choice" tier, you will let us know which color you'd like when we send out our official backer survey which will most likely be next week. If you'd like to make a change, you can do so until the project ends tomorrow night at 11:59PM CST. Progress: We continue to make great progress on your products! Final testing is being done on the pilot run with encouraging results, cases are being made, and app development is moving forward at a great pace. Bonus Feature: Connect Multiple jamstik+'s to the same device! We also have a little known secret to reveal.. with the jamstik+ app, you can connect more than 1 jamstik+ to the same iPad or iPhone and play different sounds at the same time! This is going to make for some fun group jams, and we'll come up with a video for you soon. For now you can see how fast it is to connect :) How many jamstik+'s can connect at one time? We're still testing, but we'll just say AT LEAST 3. *note pre-release interface shown. If anyone has any questions over the final hours, let us know! It's hard to believe we're finally here with all of you supporting us.. it's truly a vision come true for the team here. The whole experience has motivated us even more to deliver the best experience we can.. and that's what we plan to do! Thank You !!! -Matt &amp; The jamstik+ Team Projects We Love: We have to tell you about an awesome crowdfunding project run by our friends at Soundbrenner. They've developed The Soundbrenner Pulse: The world’s first wearable device for musicians. It literally allows you to FEEL the beat when playing your jamstik+! This is the smart-metronome to our smart-guitar, but so much more. It connects to your smartphone and adds tons of extra functionality including multi-player synchronization and MIDI support! Check them out today as they have a special One Day Only Sale going on. Wow this came up fast.. we are thrilled to announce that we’ve reached the 150 donations mark, and we’re ALMOST keeping up with donations! We’ve already shipped over 100 original jamstik's to Music Education and Music Therapy, and some awesome things are happening in music programs and schools across the nation. Everyone.. thank you so much for being with us to make these donations happen! 150 donations also means you’ve unlocked the 4th stretch goal! As for your stretch goal, this one’s a variety pack. MAC APPS - As you know, the jamstik+ works with the Mac with GarageBand and other DAW's, but originally, our Apps were built only for mobile devices. Reaching this point means, we'll plan to have the official jamstik+ app, AND the jamTutor series ported to Mac this summer. THIRD PARTY INTEGRATIONS - As we’ve hit the 150 mark, we’ve begun serious talks with other app developers for some really cool integrations on both the educational and production sides. We’ll be working to release developer tools so even more of this type of stuff can happen! We may not be able to announce the full details on everything just yet, but know that we are fully committed to provide a robust and compelling suite of options for you, our supporters! This will be a big deal so stay tuned. LEFTY MODE - In case you missed the announcement, we are officially supporting lefties! Delivery for lefty models will have to be in August due to extra testing and modifications, like restringing them for you in the office, but we will have full app support ready when you get them! We’ll have you tell us in the final backers survey if you’d prefer a lefty model. See the FAQ for full details! EXTRA BONUS AWESOMENESS We were going to save this for a final stretch goal, but we just couldn’t wait to show you. We love you all so much that we put together a little test to see how extreme we could take the, “Play Guitar Anywhere” concept. Actually it all happened pretty organically, and we are excited about how the project turned out! Again, thank you so much for your continued support, the sharing and the feedback and input. We'll be back with you soon! Stay tuned as we are just getting started. For now: Enjoy your weekends! We’ll leave you with this. - Matt &amp; the Jamstik Team <url>" Approaching Nirvana " - " Stars " Hey Everyone!

Watch above as Chris lays down a track in Logic Pro X on Mac. Below, he demonstrates use in another one of our favorite programs, Ableton Live which is available for Mac and PC. Jamstik+ in Ableton Live on Mac Apps We Got To Have Many of you have been curious about the different apps that work well with the jamstik+, so we've responded by launching a new blog series on our website: " Apps We Got To Have " which will showcase different compatible apps, and why we love them. Check it out, we've got 3 great videos to start off the showcase series, and you can expect more soon. It's hard to believe, but we are 30 days into our campaign. Thanks to everyone for making this such an awesome experience, we hope you're as excited as ever! There's just 12 days left but we still have plenty of new content coming your way. Talk to you soon, -Matt, Chris, &amp; The jamstik Team Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Projects We Love Sometimes there's another Kickstarter project we just have to share with you all.. and our friends over at Ignite Lighters are changing the way you light candles forever. Great for setting the mood before a nice long jamstik+ jam session :) Check it out below! This revolutionary new lighter has no flame and requires no fuel. Instead, it's powered by a rechargeable battery and produces a super high-intensity electric arc that can instantly light candles, incense, gas stoves, and a whole lot more! JamTutor Walkthrough: Here, we take a first-time guitar player, Malin, through the various parts of our free instructional app series: jamTutor. Wow, she surprised us at how quickly she picked it up! Thanks so much for your participation, Malin! Our First Accelerometer Demo: You guys helped us blow past our 3rd stretch goal last week to incorporate an accelerometer into the jamstik+. We've been hard at work on a prototype and are having a lot of fun with it. We're happy to announce that every unit will be shipped with this functionality built right in! Check out the demo using a prototype model with Ableton Live. *Note the accelerometer will be built inside the jamstik+, not externally like in the demo. Projects We Love: MAGZET: The Audio Jack Reinvented with the Power of Magnets We'd like to give a shout out to another company who launched a Kickstarter campaign for something incredibly cool that you should definitely check out. It's called MAGZET , an audio jack that connects to your devices via magnets. Think Apple MagSafe but for audio jacks which helps save your devices, headphones, and audio cables from damage! If you plan to use headphones or portable speakers with your jamstik+ (and we think you should) we definitely recommend you check it out! Thanks for following along and helping the campaign continue to grow! We've still got plenty of new content coming to you in the final two weeks! As always, we appreciate any sharing of our campaign that you can do. Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Talk to you soon, -Matt, Chris, &amp; The jamstik Team One of the biggest reasons we made the jamstik is to help to make a new generation of guitar players. With your support, we're already committed to over 100 donations, and it's amazing to see what just ONE can do in a classroom. We've been working with an talented and dedicated group of music educators, and the benefits of the jamstik are really catching on. Here's an inside look into the classroom of one of our first pilot programs run by Troy Strand - Music Composition and Music Teacher at MacPhail Center for Music and Paideia Academy. We met up with Troy earlier this week to watch how he uses the jamstik with his 6th grade guitar class, and to drop off one of our first rounds of donated jamstiks. What an awesome experience.. we’re excited to see how the the kids in his classes are learning and growing musically with the jamstik. Another exciting initiative with the jamstik is its use in Music Therapy. This past fall, we were fortunate enough to be contacted by Destiny Henn, an undergraduate student in Music Therapy at Augsburg College who had heard about the jamstik through her advisor, Peter Meyer MT-BC. After they expressed interest in obtaining a few jamstiks to do research on its practicality and functionality of design in a clinical setting, we were happy to lend them a few. Since then, Destiny has completed preliminary research and together with Peter, they hope to begin plans for clinical research soon. They've also introduced the instrument to many music therapists with impressive ideas for the future of the jamstik and how it can advance the field. This past weekend, they spoke at the Great Lakes Region of the American Music Therapy Association's 2015 Conference in Minneapolis, MN. We are thrilled to have such forward thinking and caring professionals on our side! In closing for today, we'd like to thank everyone involved with our efforts so far. It's incredible to work on such a fun product, but to have the chance to make a difference in education and therapy is above and beyond what we could ask for and has become one of our biggest missions. Music is empowering, it can heal, and its something you can take with you for a lifetime. The connections that have happened so far have been spontaneous and built through proactive networking, so if you appreciate the stories above, please share our mission with the buttons below.
