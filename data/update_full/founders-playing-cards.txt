One small step. One giant leap. So, the surveys have not gone out yet. We've gotten some good suggestions from a few of you that it makes more sense to hold off on sending them out until we are a bit closer to actually getting the orders fulfilled and shipped. This way, we can hope to avoid any confusion for shipping addresses and other details. So you shouldn't expect those for a few weeks still. The main reason for the delay since the last update is that we were originally trying to hold off on this one until we had our pop-up shop ready to launch, so that we could take orders for those that missed the project, those that just missed the add-on options at the end, or those that were just interested in picking up the Founders Booklet (we are just now setting the last of the type). We'll certainly keep you posted as to exactly when the Store will be open, but for right now, we look like we are about a week or so away from launching. Beyond that, production on the cards is moving along smoothly, as we've been working with the US Playing Card Company, and are hoping to see our first proofs very soon. We also think we may have found the right Engraver for the coin, but are still weighing a few options. We will have some images of the Founders Booklet to share in our next update, and hopefully, the first images of the card proofs. Once again, thanks to everyone for backing our project, we'll be working on getting your feedback on our next releases very soon. We have submitted our design to USPCC. We have decided to hold off on the survey for a few days. After hearing the input from a few backers and seeing the amount of people that have yet to have their payments go through, we wanted to make sure we didn't leave anyone behind. We are going to aim for mid week, so if you are having issues with payment let us know. Thank you. So, as many of you have requested it, we've decided to open up the option for add-ons in these final hours. For each Inaugural Coin you'd like, simply add $ 13 to your reward, or you can choose an American Ace Tshirt, for the same price, just $ 13 . We hope this comes as welcome news to many of you, and hopefully it can help push us past our 300% goal to get the Founders Booklet made. We've also opened up the Uncut Collector's Sheets as a solo reward, as many have requested this. At $ 55, It will come signed and numbered. Lastly, as we are approaching our goal to get everyone a Free Founders Booklet, you can help in the final push by going to the Founders Facebook page , and sharing your favorite card , or your favorite album or image . Thank you all so much for your support over these last 30 days, we appreciate all of you. We are excited, and very much looking forward to getting these produced and in your hands as soon as possible. .:. Diamonds, once known as the suit of Coins, or Pentacles, represent the classic urban third estate, the Merchant Class. The Founders version covers the era from the ‘Square Deal’ to the ‘New Deal’, WWI, WWII, and the peace and prosperity that followed. . . . The King of Victory Franklin Delano Roosevelt . . . “His love of his own country, his respect for its constitution, his power of gauging the tides and currents of its mobile public opinion, were always evident, but, added to these, were the beatings of that generous heart which was always stirred to anger and to action by spectacles of aggression and oppression by the strong against the weak.” Winston Churchill’s famous friendship with FDR, regarded by many as “the partnership that saved the world”, still echoes through time as a model for international partnerships. He went on to describe him as “the greatest American friend we have ever known and the greatest champion of freedom who has ever brought help and comfort from the new world to the old.” Roosevelt is best known for leading America through the Great Depression with his New Deal, building an international coalition that defeated Nazi Germany, Italy and Japan in World War II and creating the United Nations. View Full Resolution (1485 x 2085) View Full Resolution (2750 x 1350) FDR is seated in his “throne” with a ribbon bearing three stars, signifying his unprecedented three terms as President. His fireside chats, embrace of technology, and legendary oratory skills are symbolized with the microphone in his hand. . . . The Queen of Vigor Rosie the Riveter . . . “While other girls attend their favorite cocktail bar, Sipping Martinis, munching caviar, There’s a girl who’s putting them to shame, Rosie is her name” She is a cultural icon that represents the millions of women who took over in the manufacturing plants, producing munitions and material support during World War II. Rosie first showed up in a song by Redd Evans and John Jacob Loeb, in 1942, based on a woman named Rosie Walter, who worked the night shift, building the F4U Corsair fighter. Visually, she eventually became associated with Rosie Monroe, a woman who built B-24 and B-29 bombers in Michigan, and starred in popular films promoting the war effort at home. Rosie the Riveter represents the drastic shift in the relationship between women and the workplace, as by the end of the war, nearly one out of every four married women worked outside the home. View Full Resolution (1485 x 2085) View Full Resolution (2750 x 1350) Rosie holds her Rivet Gun, representing the blue collar worker, and the manufacturing industry that served our nation so well during her era. . . . The Jack of Valor Theodore Roosevelt . . . Upon hearing of Roosevelt’s death, Vice President Thomas R. Marshall said, “Death had to take him in his sleep, for if he was awake there'd have been a fight.” He was a naturalist, explorer, hunter, author, soldier and public servant that held such offices as Assemblyman, New York City Police Commissioner, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Lieutenant Colonel of the ‘Rough Riders’, Governor of New York, Vice President, and still managed to become the youngest President ever at only 42 years of age. On February 14, 1884, at just 27 years old, Roosevelt lost both his wife and mother. His diary entry for that day was simply a large X and the line, “The light has gone out of my life.” He never once again ever spoke publicly or privately about his first wife, and he soon headed west to become a Ranchman in the badlands of the Dakota Territory. He began rebuilding himself, writing about frontier life for magazines, publishing three books, and serving as Deputy Sheriff, where he would meet and eventually become lifelong friends with Seth Bullock, the famous Sheriff of Deadwood, South Dakota. View Full Resolution (1485 x 2085) View Full Resolution (2750 x 1350) While campaigning in 1912, Roosevelt was shot as he entered an auditorium in Milwaukee. The bullet tore through his 50-page speech, lodging itself in his chest. He continued onto the stage, saying, “Friends, I shall ask you to be as quiet as possible. I don't know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot; but it takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose.” He went on to give a 90-minute speech. This moment is immortalized with the red bullet wound found at the center of this card. Also, in his hand, he holds his Winchester Model 1895 .405, or as it became known, “Big Medicine”. The Clubs were originally known as Wands or Batons, representing the number 3 and thus the classic Third Estate, the largest class of people comprising the Commoners, the Peasants, the Working Class. We have decided to refer to this suit as simply representative of the People, and as the true defenders of freedom, liberty, and justice, their American Suit is the Shield. . . . The King of Liberty Abraham Lincoln . . . “O Captain! My Captain! our fearful trip is done; The ship has weather'd every rack; the prize we sought is won; The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting, While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring” The great American poet, Walt Whitman, had dreamt the night before the assassination of the President about a ship entering harbor under full sail, with his idol, Abraham Lincoln as the archangel Captain. After hearing of his passing, he translated this vision into what would become his most famous poem, “O Captain! My Captain”. Seven score and ten years ago, Lincoln gave his Gettysburg Address during the Civil War, declaring that “we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain — that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.” View Full Resolution (1485 x 2085) View Full Resolution (2750 x 1350) Lincoln is seen holding his walking stick and timepiece, set to 7:20, the time of his death, serving as a Memento Mori for us all. Also, however, representative of 720 degrees, thus two circles, a classic symbol of infinity, or moreover, Lincoln’s immortality. The chains, representing the Emancipation Proclamation and the severed bonds of slavery, are broken in the middle by the divided red vest, representing the blood shed during the Civil War. . . . The Queen of Freedom Harriet Tubman . . . “We have had the greatest heroine of the age here, Harriet Tubman, a black woman, and a fugitive slave, who has been back eight times secretly and brought out in all sixty slaves with her, including all her own family, besides aiding many more in other ways to escape. Her tales of adventure are beyond anything in fiction and her ingenuity and generalship are extraordinary — the slaves call her Moses.” Thomas Wentworth Higginson wrote of Harriet Tubman to his mother in 1859. Her lasting impression on him would eventually result in his becoming Colonel of the First South Carolina Volunteers, the first federally authorized regiment of freedmen. Harriet Tubman carried out over 13 rescue missions, personally saving over 70 slaves through the Underground Railroad. During the Civil War, she began serving the Union Army as a cook and nurse, but went on to become an armed scout, spy, and the first woman to lead an armed expedition in the war, the Combahee River Raid, liberating over 700 slaves. View Full Resolution (1485 x 2085) View Full Resolution (2750 x 1350) As a leader of the Abolitionist Movement, and a head of the Underground Railroad, she is seen here as a more humble and realistic visual representation of Lady Liberty, holding her torch as a beacon to freedom. . . . The Jack of Justice Frederick Douglass . . . “He stood there like an African prince, conscious of his dignity and power, grand in his physical proportions, majestic in his wrath, as with keen wit, satire and indignation he portrayed the bitterness of slavery, the humiliation of subjection to those who in all human virtues and capacities were inferior to himself. His denunciation of our national crime, of the wild and guilty fantasy that men could hold property in man, poured like a torrent that fairly made his hearers tremble.” Fellow abolitionist and civil rights advocate, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, wrote these words after hearing that her friend, Douglass, had passed. Going on to say, “Frederick Douglass is not dead! His grand character will long be an object lesson in our national history; his lofty sentiments of liberty, justice and equality, echoed on every platform over our broad land, must influence and inspire many coming generations!” Internationally respected as an uncompromising abolitionist, a tireless servant for justice and equality, and an unyielding defender of women's rights. He became a trusted advisor to Abraham Lincoln, United States Marshal for the District of Columbia, Recorder of Deeds for Washington, DC, and Minister-General to the Republic of Haiti. View Full Resolution (1485 x 2085) View Full Resolution (2750 x 1350) Douglass is seen holding the abolitionist newspaper he founded and edited, The North Star. Representing the printed word as a powerful tool of the people. Also, at the center of his design is a visual allusion to the Underground Railroad. Before we announce the goals, we just wanted to acknowledge what may have been a small, but significant error on our part ... we forgot to mention that all shipping within the USA is included. We apologize for any confusion, and hope things are a bit clearer now. So, stretch goals ... after considering the possibilities, here's what we came up with: 300% - Purchase (2) two decks or more, get a FREE Founders Booklet. 400% - Purchase (3) three decks or more, get a FREE Founders Coin. 500% - Purchase (3) three decks or more, get a FREE Deck of the Executive Editions. View Full Resolution (1920 x 1080) . . . We know that you all responded pretty resoundingly to the Greenback Edition as your favorite Founders of the future, and we really appreciate you all taking the time to give us your feedback. However, the plan for the Greenbacks has always been to create a whole new set of court cards, featuring engraved portraits of the same figures, in the same poses, but done in the style of classic American bank notes. So, with that in mind, while we continue developing the illustrations for the Greenbacks, we wanted to say thanks by releasing the Executive Editions early. And if we manage to get past 500% funded, we’ll simply give you one for free. A little later, we’ll post with some more details and images of the Executive Editions, and the Founders Booklet. Hearts (originally Cups) classically represent the Clergy. Each of the figures selected for this suit are children of the Enlightenment, and lived as leaders and visionaries with a devout sense of duty and purpose to all mankind. . . . The King of Independence Thomas Jefferson . . . As he welcomed the Nobel Prize winners of 1962 to a White House dinner, President John F. Kennedy opened by saying, “I think this is the most extraordinary collection of talent, of human knowledge, that has ever been gathered together at the White House, with the possible exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone.” A true Renaissance Man, Jefferson spoke five languages fluently, was deeply interested in nature, science, invention, architecture, religion and philosophy, and as JFK went on to say, “he was a gentleman of 32 who could calculate an eclipse, survey an estate, tie an artery, plan an edifice, try a cause, break a horse, and dance the minuet.” View Full Resolution (1485 x 2085) View Full Resolution (2750 x 1350) His most famous contribution, was in primarily authoring the Declaration of Independence (seen in his hand), and specifically these famous American words; “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” . . . The Queen of Revolution Susan B. Anthony . . . “She was the most harmoniously developed character I have ever known—a living soul whose individuality was blended into oneness with all humanity. She lived, yet not she; humanity lived in her. Fighting the battle for individual freedom, she was so lost to the consciousness of her own personality that she was unconscious of existence apart from all mankind.” Anthony not only cast the first female vote in a Presidential Election in 1872, but after her arrest, trial and eventual conviction, she promised “I will never pay a dollar of your unjust penalty”, a promise she kept to the end of her days. She lived her life without apology, famously believing “failure is impossible” and teaching that all Americans should “forget conventionalisms; forget what the world thinks of you stepping out of your place; think your best thoughts, speak your best words, work your best works, looking to your own conscience for approval.” View Full Resolution (1485 x 2085) View Full Resolution (2750 x 1350) She is seen dressed in her Late Victorian dress, which she famously wore at many speeches and public events. In her hand, she holds her most powerful weapon, the election ballot. . . . The Jack of All Trades Benjamin Franklin . . . “He seized the lightning from Heaven and the scepter from the Tyrants.” Franklin exemplified the American spirit as perhaps the first great self-made man of our nation, going from a poor son of a candlemaker to an influential man of international acclaim; accepted, respected, and embraced by all social classes. He led the way as a prolific author, printer, political theorist, politician, postmaster, scientist, musician, inventor, satirist, civic activist, statesman and diplomat. As the elder adviser and sage, he was truly the American Merlin. View Full Resolution (1485 x 2085) View Full Resolution (2750 x 1350) Franklin’s kite experiments with electricity are immortalized here, with his string and key seen carrying the electric charge. In his hand, a quill, signifying his process of publishing his experiments, as he believed his scientific works were to be used for increasing efficiency and human improvement. . . . We will be posting our next update in just a few moments, announcing the stretch goal plan that we've managed to come up with. And again, we want to thank you all for your support. Those that show it patiently, and those that show it passionately, we appreciate you more than you realize. Stretch goals for the final week coming up next! Before they were the Spades they are now, this suit was known to the classical world as Swords (many Latin and most Tarot cards still employ these old suits). Representing the number One (1) and Nobility, the Founders Spades display the era of the original founding, the birth of America. . . . The King of Unity George Washington . . . “First in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen, he was second to none in humble and enduring scenes of private life. Pious, just, humane, temperate, and sincere; uniform, dignified, and commanding; his example was as edifying to all around him as were the effects of that example lasting … Correct throughout, vice shuddered in his presence and virtue always felt his fostering hand.” His friend and comrade, Henry “Light Horse Harry” Lee, famously described Washington posthumously better than anyone ever could. He really needs no introduction, and the selection is obvious. Washington could have been King of America, but in an act more noble than that of any royal figure before him, he stepped down and handed the power back to the people, thus setting the standard of perpetual peaceful revolution in America through Presidential elections. View Full Resolution (1485 x 2085) View Full Resolution (2750 x 1350) Washington is shown ready for combat in his General’s Uniform, brandishing his Battle Sword to represent the Strength &amp; Honor of America. He also bears the Washington family crest over his heart, and is anchored at center by a ring of 13 rings containing 13 stars and a 13 pointed sun, symbolizing his role in bringing together all 13 colonies into a single nation. . . . The Queen of Peace Pocahontas . . . “a child of tenne yeares old, which not only for feature, countenance, and proportion, much exceedeth any of the rest of his people, but for wit and spirit the only nonpareil of Powhatan’s country” Captain John Smith, documented his first visit from Pocahontas in 1608, famously describing her as “the only nonpareil”, a Middle French phrase meaning “unparalleled” or “without equal”. Known also as Matoaka (“Little Snow Feather”), Amonute, and eventually Lady Rebecca, ‘Pocahontas’ was more of a nickname that her father, Chief Powhatan, gave to his daughters (meaning “little wanton”, or “playful little one”). She represents the native people of this land, the Eve from our garden of Eden, exemplifying the time before colonization and European expansion. View Full Resolution (1485 x 2085) View Full Resolution (2750 x 1350) She is wrapped in her native dress, and wears two white feathers in her hair in reference to her original formal name, Matoaka. She carries a white flower and pipe symbolizing peace &amp; prosperity, and over her heart is a red gem representing the sacrifice made by her people. . . . The Jack of Justice John Adams . . . “He is vain, irritable, and a bad calculator of the force and probable effect of the motives which govern men. This is all the ill which can possibly be said of him … He is so amiable that I pronounce you will love him, if ever you become acquainted with him.” Thomas Jefferson wrote this of Adams in a letter to James Madison in 1787, before any rivalry between them had even begun. Their time as political opponents eventually resolved into one of the longest and most enlightening friendships in American history, giving us some of the finest discourse from two of the sharpest minds of the day. In addition to assisting Jefferson in drafting the Declaration of Independence, serving as the first Vice President, the Second President, the first ambassador to England, and authoring the Massachusetts Constitution, Adams was a firm advocate for a government held strong through a system of checks and balances, a nation without slavery, and achieving peace through diplomacy.

In our next update, we will cover the Hearts, and we hope to have an announcement on our upcoming stretch goals as well ... stay tuned. So before we get to the rest of the Spades, we wanted to share this look at some of the alternate back designs for the other editions we have planned. Let us know which is your favorite, and we may try to figure out a way to include it early as part of our stretch goal plan. View Full Resolution (4070 x 1490) The Founders back design takes its inspiration from many elements found historically in early American architecture &amp; engraving work. The ornamental features are seen most prominently in bonds &amp; stock certificates, bank notes, &amp; official print material. View Full Resolution (1424 x 2000) View Full Resolution (2750 x 1300) All four of the classic suits are each imprinted with a unique American symbol to represent their respective classes; Spades (Nobility) has the Perched Eagle, Hearts (Clergy) has the Eagle in Flight, Clubs (The People) has the Shield, and Diamonds (Merchants) has the Star. All of these symbols are brought together only on the back. Over the center seal is a banner bearing the latin phrase ‘Libertas Et Justitia Omnibus’ (Liberty &amp; Justice for all), which is, of course, taken from final line of the Pledge of Allegiance, as written by Francis Bellamy in 1892. . . . View Full Resolution (1780 x 2500) View Full Resolution (2750 x 1300) The American Ace brings together 13 unique symbols from the American visual language. The Eagle, the Shield, the Flag, the Motto (E Pluribus Unum), the Founding (1776), the Scales of Justice, the Arrows, the Olive Branch, the Declaration, the Constitution, the Unfinished Pyramid, 13 Colonies (13 Stars), &amp; 50 States (50 Stars). In our next update we'll take a closer look at the rest of the Spades with Washington, Pocahontas, &amp; Adams as the King of Unity, the Queen of Peace, &amp; the Jack of Justice. We know that we certainly aren’t the first to design a set of playing cards honoring important figures in American history, but we did try to bring a new approach to this classic idea. For us, it began about a year ago, while searching through the Archives of the Department of Design. We came across a nearly 200 year old playing card set designed by J.Y. Humphreys in Philadelphia in 1819, called the ‘Seminole Wars Deck’. It is considered to be the first four color deck, and it introduced yellow Diamonds, green Clubs, blue Spades, and red Hearts. It featured Andrew Jackson (Spades), George Washington (Hearts), Thomas Jefferson (Clubs), and John Adams (Diamonds) as the Kings. The Queens were goddesses of mythology; the Queen of Wisdom, Minerva (Spades), the Queen of Love, Venus (Hearts), the Queen of Agriculture, Ceres (Clubs), and the Queen of Justice, Justitia (Diamonds). While the Jacks were represented by Native American Chiefs; Red Jacket (Hearts), Joseph Brant (Clubs), Gy-ant-wachia (Diamonds), and an unidentified Chief as the Jack of Spades. The ‘Seminole’ deck was clearly designed as a celebration of the overthrow of monarchical rule, and the desire to create a world without royalty. And so, we considered restoring and releasing a deck representing these same or similar images, but with updated engravings to more accurately match our modern visions of these legendary figures. This deck, however, did not use the classic symmetrical design theme, and lacked corner rank and suit markings. In today’s setting, this was more of a collector’s deck than that of a player’s for practical purpose. This forced us to the decision of whether we wanted to create a collector’s deck, or something brand new, something which has never yet existed … a casino style playing card set featuring the Founding Fathers of the United States. A new American standard, holding true all modern card conventions (One Eyed Jacks, Suicide King, etc), while adding a new layer anchored in each figure’s story and place in history. The choice was simple, and we then had only to decide upon which figures and the model we would use to select and arrange them. First, was acknowledging that the suits were already designed in a numerical order from 1 to 4 as Spades (one (1) point), Hearts (two (2) bumps), Clubs (three (3) parts), and Diamonds (four (4) corners). We applied this order to time, creating a chronological model, then overlayed the classic class structure of the suits as Nobility (Spades), Clergy (Hearts), the People (Clubs), and Merchants (Diamonds). The Founders suits essentially break down as follows; the Spades are the original founding, as we went from Colonies to Revolution to America (the selection and breaking of ground), the Hearts are the birth and infancy of early America (the first heartbeats of a new living, breathing nation), the Clubs are the Civil War and Post-Industrial Revolution (the Preservation of the Union and Emancipation of Slavery), while the Diamonds represent our most recent founding, from the ‘Square Deal’ to the ‘New Deal’, WWI to WWII, and the peace, prosperity, and baby boom that followed. In the next few updates, we’ll be going through each suit and each card design in more detail, as well as sharing some sketches and process work. Thanks again everyone for supporting this project, we are excited to share more with you all soon. Wow, thank you all so much for the overwhelming support! While we had hoped for a good reception, we never imagined to come flying out of the gate as we have, hitting our goal in just 3 days! Thank you all, we will be doing all we can to make sure you will have your Founders Playing Cards in hand for your July 4th celebrations! We've heard a few requests for some different reward packages, and we will definitely be working to try and set it as you all would have it, just as soon as we can. Right now, we are looking into sorting out some stretch goals, so you can look forward to possibly getting a little extra something. Also, we are looking to likely introduce a few new items to go along with the cards. We've set up a Facebook page for the Founders , so swing by and like us. Or, if you really like us, share these recent promo images that we put together for you all for President's Day: Also, we will be posting more frequent updates over the next few days, to discuss the back story of these cards, and some details on the designs and decisions for each card. Let us know if there's anything else you'd like to see, or if you have any suggestions for requests for new Founders related items to include in our stretch goals. Thank you all again so much, you are the founders of the Founders, and we appreciate you more than you know.
