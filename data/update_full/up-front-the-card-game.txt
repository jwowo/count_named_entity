Hello All, We have finally concluded the lawsuit with Phil Sauer, this has left our company depleted of all resources as most would understand happens from lawsuits. We were unable to post status updates during that time and now that the case has been dismissed, we can speak to the future of Up Front. We are trying to find some help from some other publishers to complete this project and move forward. There is interest and we are working to sort out the details but nothing has been agreed to. Your understanding during this time while we try to get this completed will be appreciated. Once we have solidified a deal, there will be an announcement. We appreciate these folks listening to our plea and we are hopeful to come to an arrangement as quickly as possible. Our biggest concern is that the supporters of this project can see the finished product. Best Regards Here are the links to the Finns, please have a look! <url>’s most important weapons. The critical squad weapons like the machine guns, mortars, and ATR are trusted to your steady hands, earned through years of real “time in”. On a lighter note, we are confident that no self-respecting British professional soldier would want to be referred to by an American or French army rank title anyways. Your new Section Commanders, Corporals Banister and Scarborough have the troops formed up and are awaiting your inspection. Platoon, Platoon-SHUN! <url>– this is because we have moved the ROUT process to be greater than or equal to – so its now consistent with the PAN and KIA procedures. So please be aware of that. That being said, this team of people, from all over the world, deserves your support and they need to be congratulated for their accomplishment. It has been a long road with this and these guys have busted their asses to make it perfect. The team's hard work and demand for perfection is going to deliver a new edition deserving of the legendary Up Front game. If you are a supporter who is going to have their name on one of the nationality cards as a reward for supporting, please double check that the spelling of your name or the name you wanted on there, is correct. If you find an error, this is the time to get it fixed. Alright, enough chatter, I am proud to present to you the USA as our first nation revealed! <url>’t have had to be. For that we apologize, these are not things that we projected in our planning and that has caused the game to be delayed. We are happy to report that Ron Volstad is recovering well from his surgery and that the volunteers have stepped up and really thrown their backs into helping us get the game done. We have had many more volunteers come on board since the beginning of the project and we are so grateful for them, they are the saviors. Here is what we can tell you, first, this game has evolved far beyond what was initially discussed with Courtney Allen. There have been a bunch of great people that have come on board with brilliant design ideas and fantastic knowledge to grow the title. You, our supporter, need to know that the additional content in this game is absolutely amazing. The level of detail put into each and every one of them is something that we never imagined when we started talking about the additional material. When you see it and play it, you will understand that the wait is well worth it. The artwork and layout are very close to completion, it has been said before but there are things that change and with those changes we have had to make adjustments to art and that doesn’t just happen over night. Schedules change and while people are part of the equation, there are going to be things that happen. Again, we are extremely grateful to everyone helping and with a large team there are snags and problems that come up and they are not always solved quickly, much to everyone’s disappointment. The card stock is just getting the final okay, the sizes of boxes defined, the artwork to surround those boxes etc. All of these things are coming together and while we don’t have an exact date for completion, we are closer than ever in knowing when that will be. We ask you for your patience in this, we understand and are equally frustrated with the delay but we can’t make it go any faster. The project has morphed into something much bigger than initially planned and it just means a little while longer. We are going to get this game produced, we are working through the issues and we will update you with a completion date as soon as we know it. Thank you again for your understanding, your patience, and your support in making Courtney Allen’s Up Front. We realize the wait has been long and Ron Volstad passes on his apologies to you all. However, he has delivered of an absolutely stunning piece of artwork for the cover of Up Front. Todd has now given approval to reveal to the world the Limited Edition rules that all Kickstarter supporters will be receiving in a leather bound format. Remember, this rulebook is intended to be a one-stop reference book for ALL the core rules AND all the rules required to cover all the stretch reward items. NOTES NOT yet final the random reinforcement tables for the new nations are still incomplete Here's what's in the LE rules above and beyond the core rules; 38 New Terrains 6 New Terrain Decks Weather Hypothermia and Heatstroke Heavy Machine Guns Katana Molotov Cocktails PIATs Rifle Grenade Launchers Field Medics Human Wave Mine Sweepers Paradrops 8 AFV Attributes 18 Troop Attributes 38 New Armies/Forces Aera Attacks Banzai Attacks Dare-Death Attacks Here is the link to the rules: Limited Edition Rules As you have just seen, the VERY extensive limited edition rules have been posted and Todd has requested some more eyes on this tome. Please email Todd Banister directly at <email> if you are interested. Of course, not everyone will be able to participate and Todd will advise once he has all the proofers needed. Oops, I misunderstood Todd and the rules I just posted were NOT the limited edition rules but instead, an updated version of the core rules. We will be posting a print version with artwork shortly for the core rules. The below statement still stands true though and will post those once proofed. Todd has recently "finished" the Limited Edition rules that all Kickstarter supporters will be receiving in a pleather bound format. Remember, this rulebook is intended to be a one-stop reference book for ALL the core rules AND all the rules required to cover all the stretch reward items. Here's what's in the LE rules above and beyond the core rules; 38 new Terrains 6 new Terrain decks Weather Hypothermia and Heatstroke Heavy Machine Guns Katana Molotov Cocktails PIATs Rifle Grenade Launchers Field Medics Human Wave Mine Sweepers Paradrops 8 AFV Attributes 18 Troop Attributes 38 new Armies/Forces Aera Attacks Banzai Attacks Dare-Death Attacks As the title states, these are NEAR final but will give you all a REALLY good idea of how these will look on the table. We have some final tweaks to do on the layout but here is a peek at the artwork for some of the AFVs so far. All the painting has been done by David Bocquelet. AFV Preview Here is the first piece of finished work by an artist you have not yet seen material from; Mark Stacey. As you all have seen from our updates, all the artwork for the nationalities are not yet posted and therefore not yet complete. Until this is done, we simply don't want to go to the printer. PLEASE, don't read into this. It is simply a matter of the material not yet being complete and we are pretty sure you would not like to receive blank Personality cards for Norway, Italy, Folgore, 101st etc... We have tried as best we could to get some definite dates for delivery from the artists but as you all know, they are doing their best to fit this into their existing schedules. On one hand we would love to have them give us a hard date and on the other hand, we need to be gracious for their efforts to help us out. So, with the feedback we have gotten from the remaining artists, we are aiming for a November release date. Special thanks to "Hawkeye" for taking the time to take some excellent photos during his visit to the Special Warfare museum at Fort Bragg and providing them as reference for Peter Dennis. Look what just fell from the sky compliments of Peter Dennis. Steve Noon did some great poses for the French! Won't these look awesome as life sized stand-ups in a booth? Peter Dennis did a great job on these guys. Some more stunning art work by Adam Hook. You thought the Japanese pencils looked good? Well, here they are in color! Please enjoy the second set of art by Adam Hook - the Fallschirmjager. Here are the swords you asked for; For your viewing pleasure. For your viewing pleasure. The color versions of the Soviets were just submitted. One of the new artists on the team, Adam Hook, has just submitted the pencils for the Russians. Yes, Brad Knoll has asked him to change the belt on the officers to the officer's belt with the star buckle. Peter Dennis has just delivered the Aussies. Again, let us be VERY clear that Radiant Gaming is perfectly viable and plans to proceed with business which includes producing Up Front. All Kickstarter supporters will get the game they paid for. Will there be a delay, yes, but that is due to our main artist no longer being able to deliver the art as promised due to health concerns. We think we have responded well though in hiring Peter Dennis and Steve Noon (each of whom you have seen art from already) and more recently Stephen Walsh, Gerry Embleton, Adam Hook and Sigve Solberg. Thank you. Todd says: After we released the rules to the Internet, there was several players concerned that entry into CC with the new rules was now too easy when compared to the previous edition. While there are some constraints as to the changes to CC (like infiltration should be totally separate at this point, etc), there was still plenty of wiggle room to see if we could modify the ruleset to get it more in line with the previous edition. Thus I reached out to several of the previous UF World Champions to see if we could come up with a modified solution. Over the last couple of weeks, the CC Group have thrown out a variety of ideas – some I had directly tried to work through myself in the past and others that were totally brand new. But in the end, sometimes the simplest solutions are the best. The essence of what we did was try and reproduce the same (or as close as possible) entry percentages from the 2nd edition rules with the new rules. What I found was if I applied a simple –1 to the Morale Check for CC Entry, the percentages suddenly fell relatively in line. For example: Morale 1: old system 22% new system 14% Morale 2: old system 40% new system 27% Morale 3: old system 53% new system 49% Morale 4: old system 64% new system 67% Morale 5: old system 72% new system 80% While not 100% exact, the numbers were close enough to start to work through other examples If we apply an additional –1 modifier to the new CC entry morale check due to being outnumbered, we find that the relative percentages are equal to: Morale 1: 11% - exactly the same as old system vs 4 defenders Morale 2: 14% - exactly the same as old system vs 5 defenders Morale 3: 27% - exactly the same as old system vs 4 defenders Morale 4: 49% - approximately the same as old system vs 2.5 defenders Morale 5: 67% - approximately the same as old system vs 1.5 defenders Or another way to look at it – vs a group with 1-3 additional defenders (using an additional –1 to the MC combined with the previous –1 for charging): Morale 1: old system outcome 11-18% - new system 11% Morale 2: old system outcome 20-33% - new system 14% Morale 3: old system outcome 27-44% - new system 27% Morale 4: old system outcome 32-53% - new system 49% Morale 5: old system outcome 36-60% - new system 67% And finally – vs a group with 4-6 additional defenders (using an additional –2 to the MC combined with the previous –1 for charging): Morale 1: old system outcome 4-8% - new system 8% Morale 2: old system outcome 8-15% - new system 11% Morale 3: old system outcome 11-20% - new system 14% Morale 4: old system outcome 13-24% - new system 27% Morale 5: old system outcome 14-27% - new system 49% We continued to work through more and more cases applying the ever changing percentages and in the end, we have come up with a slightly modified procedure for CC Entry that is nearly on par with the previous edition. What these changes also do is: 1.) Strengthen the reason why infiltration is important (they are now the only ones that can bypass the entry morale check). 2.) Gives leaders a slight bump in importance. 3.) Rebuilds the reason for Japanese Banzai attacks. 4.) Reintroduced certain CC Entry Restrictions based upon terrain. 5.) Again, the most important is it brought the entry percentages relatively back in line with the previous edition. Now what are the changes? 1.) Now you can get into CC by passing a Morale Check or by Infiltration – no automatic via a Move card. 2.) The Morale Check has a small number of modifiers that essentially reduce the soldier's overall entry Morale. The Move card now supplies a positive bonus instead of the automatic entry. 3.) I created a new sliding target scale to allow for target numbers for very low (essentially negative morale ratings). This works perfectly in conjunction with all other morale checks in the game as none of the other checks have modifiers to them. Thus the target values are all the same – regardless of which morale check you are performing. The team has been busy on the rules and trying to incorporate suggestions from the previous post and here are the results. A big addition is the index at the end. The page numbers are slightly off but that doesn't matter at this point as all of the page numbers will have to be reassigned once these rules go through final layout anyways. <url>"spam" update but can those worried about customs issues around the Swastika please comment on whether there will be any problems with the Hakarista used by Finland in World War II? This is the symbol we would like to use for the Fins but not if it will create a customs nightmare. Tiers will open at 10:00 AM EST. Who's interested in seeing this opened up for both CAP and LTC in the last 48 hours? Another chapter from the Book of Arvold... General All Infantry Guns, of all nations, have a Breakdown rate of Red 5-6, unless otherwise noted.. They also have a Repair rate of a Black 0-6 and Elimination of a Red 6. All have the Range and To-Hit Numbers as follows: Range 0 – 0-5 Range 1 – 0-4 Range 2 – 0-3 Range 3 – 0-2 Range 4 – 0-1 Range 5 – 0 Medium Mortars (81mm) have an inherent three man crew and move like infantry guns (two movement cards, first one in sideways position). They have a Repair rate of a Black 1-5 and Elimination is a Red 4-6. Medium mortars may not employ Moving Fire. Certain infantry guns presented here were too heavy for a crew to move the distances portrayed in Up Front. Thus these guns, which will be so designated, may only be set up at the beginning of the scenario and brought in as reinforcements (where it is assumed that they are being man-handled into position after being dropped off by their transporting vehicle). They may not move at all during the game and thus may not play movement cards except to remove wire cards and arrive as reinforcements. They may not have Stream or Marsh cards placed on them as they would not set up in these types of terrain. While one may question including these infantry guns at all as they usually supported the infantry from behind the lines, history has shown that all too often these infantry guns found themselves in the front lines and required infantry to protect them. GERMAN lGrW 36 – This is the 50mm crew served light mortar used by the Wehrmacht and SS during the war. It was used in front line service through 1942, after that it was largely used in second line units. Effect number is 2. Breakdown rate is a Red 5-6 [4-6].

Though they were normally deployed as the infantry battalion level mortars, starting in 1943 they were deployed as the company level mortars to the tune of two mortars per company. Effect number is 4. Breakdown rate is a Red 5-6. Morale Value is 4 and Panic Value is 5. Rout: 0r RNC&gt;5. CCV: 4/4. Pinned CCV: 0/0. KIA: 9. Pinned KIA: 9. Pinned requires RALLY 3. Range and To-Hit Numbers as follows: Range 0 – NA/5FP Range 1 – NA/3 FP Range 2 – 0-3 Range 3 – 0-2 Range 4 – 0-1 Range 5 – 0 PAK 36 – This is the 37mm anti-tank gun. It was used through out the war though after 1941 was largely confined to second line units. While its normal penetration was useless after 1941, its ability to shoot the Stielgranate 41 (a shaped charge) staring in 1943 (not shown in the game) kept the gun in service to the end of the war. Effect Numbers are 1 and Boxed 1. Morale Values are 5 and Boxed 3. Panic Values are 6 and Boxed 4. Rout: 0r RNC&gt;6. CCV: 5/5. Pinned CCV: 1/1. KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned requires RALLY 3. No Moving Fire. PAK 38 – This is the 50mm anti-tank gun. It was used from 1941 to the end of the war.

PAK 40 – This is the 75mm anti-tank gun. It was used from 1942 to the end of the war. Though certainly the most massed produced AT gun in the German armed forces, there were never enough to go around which is why the PAKs 36 and 38 soldiered on to the end of the war. This is a heavy gun and may not be moved in the game. Effect Numbers are 4 and Boxed 5. Morale Values are 5 and Boxed 3. Panic Values are 6 and Boxed 4. Rout: 0r RNC&gt;6. CCV: 5/5. Pinned CCV: 1/1.

Pinned requires RALLY 3. No Moving Fire. leIG 18 – This is the 75mm light infantry gun. It was used through out the war. While normally a direct fire weapon, the high elevation capability of the gun (70 degrees) also allowed to be used in an indirect role at longer ranges. Effect Numbers are 4 and Boxed 2. Morale Values are 5 and Boxed 3. Panic Values are 6 and Boxed 4. Rout: 0r RNC&gt;6. CCV: 5/5. Pinned CCV: 1/1. KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned requires RALLY 3. No Moving Fire. sIG 33 – This is the 150mm heavy infantry gun. It was used through out the war. Being a very heavy weapon it can not be moved in the game. The gun had a special high explosive armor piercing round that was used on bunkers and fortification but was not meant for armored vehicles and its boxed effect number reflects its normal HE round on AFV armor. Effect Numbers are 9 and Boxed 4. Morale Values are 5 and Boxed 3. Panic Values are 6 and Boxed 4. Rout: 0r RNC&gt;6. CCV: 5/5. Pinned CCV: 1/1. KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned KIA: 9 and Boxed 7.

It served in both the Army and Marines through out the war. It was the main anti-tank gun for the US Army in North Africa and Sicily but by the time that Italy was invaded it was replaced by the 57mm ATG. However it was used in the Pacific during the entire war due to the reduced threat that Japanese tanks posed. Effect Numbers are 1 and Boxed 2. Morale Values are 4 and Boxed 2. Panic Values are 6 and Boxed 4. Rout: 0r RNC&gt;6. CCV: 4/4. Pinned CCV: 0/0. KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned requires RALLY 3. No Moving Fire.

Although it was listed as a 3 inch (76mm) mortar, it was in actuality an 81mm mortar. During the first half of the war it was plagued by a short range (about 1600 meters) but by 1942 improved propellants pushed the maximum range to about 2800 meters, thus making it comparable with the other 81mm mortars of the time. Effect Number is 4. Breakdown rate is a Red 5-6. Morale Value is 4 and Panic Value is 5. Rout: 0r RNC&gt;5. CCV: 4/4. Pinned CCV: 0/0. KIA: 9. Pinned KIA: 9. Pinned requires RALLY 3. No Moving fire. Range and To-Hit numbers as follows: Range 0 – NA/2 FP Range 1 – NA/2 FP Range 2 – 0-3 Range 3 – 0-2 Range 4 – 0-1 Range 5 – 0 Model 34 25mm Anti-Tank Gun – During the Battle for France in 1940 the British did not have enough 2 Pounder AT Guns to equip their whole British Expeditionary Force so the French loaned some of their 25mm ATGs to help them out. However they lost them all and after the Fall of France never used them again. QF 2 Pounder Anti-Tank Gun – This is the famous “2 Pounder” anti-tank gun which served in the British and Commonwealth armed services through out the war. The gun actually came in two different models, the differences being in the carriage that it was mounted in. In both models the carriage had three legs which when deployed gave the gun a very stable firing platform and 360 degree traverse. However in the Woolwich Arsenal’s carriage the wheels had to be removed thus giving the 360 degree traverse but essentially locking the gun in place during combat. In the Vickers carriage the wheels could at option only be raised but this restricted the traverse though it did give the gun the ability to be quickly moved during combat. By 1942 it was being replaced by the 6 Pounder AT Gun and so was gradually removed from service in North Africa and Europe but it was used against the Japanese right up to the end of the war. Effect Numbers are a Red 0 and Boxed 2. Morale Values are 5 and Boxed 3. Panic Values are 6 and Boxed 4. Rout: 0r RNC&gt;6. CCV: 5/5. Pinned CCV: 0/0. KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned requires RALLY 3. No Moving Fire. QF 6 Pounder Anti-Tank Gun – This is the 6 Pounder anti-tank gun which served in the British and Commonwealth forces from May of 1942 to the end of the war and for many years thereafter. It also served in the Free French forces. The British version of the gun had a shorter barrel that the American version (M1 57mm ATG) which is why it has a lesser boxed effect number than the American version. However one third of all US 57mm ATG’s produced were supplied to the British through Lend Lease so the British ended up using both versions. Effect Numbers are a Red 0 and Boxed 3. Morale Values are 5 and Boxed 3. Panic Values are 6 and Boxed 4. Rout: 0r RNC&gt; 6. CCV: 5/5. Pinned CCV: 1/1. KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned requires RALLY 3. No Moving fire. M1 57mm Anti-Tank Gun – This is the US 57mm ATG in British service. In British service it would have Morale Values of 5 and Boxed 3, CCV: 5/5, Pinned CCV: 1/1, and a DYO Value of 228 Points. QF 17 Pounder Anti-Tank Gun – This is the crew served 17 Pounder anti-tank gun in British and Commonwealth service from February 1943 to the end of the war and beyond. This is a heavy gun and can not be moved in the game. Effect Numbers are 4 and Boxed 7. Morale Values are 5 and Boxed 3. Panic values are 6 and Boxed 4. Rout: 0r RNC&gt;6. CCV: 5/5. Pinned CCV: 1/1. KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned requires RALLY 3. QF 25 Pounder Howitzer – This is the 25 Pounder howitzer which was in British and Commonwealth service all through out the war. While normally used in an indirect role and would not be in the front line, in North Africa from June 1941 to May 1942 the 25 Pounder was used in an anti-tank role for which it had an anti-round especially designed for it. After the introduction of the 6 Pounder ATG in British service, the 25 Poinder resumed its regular duties in the indirect role. This is a heavy gun and can not be moved during the game. Effect Numbers are 5 and Boxed 4. Morale Values are 5 and Boxed 3. Panic Values are 6 and Boxed 4. Rout: 0r RNC&gt;6. CCV: 5/5. Pinned CCV: 1/1. KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned requires RALLY 3. JAPANESE Type 89 50mm Grenade Discharger – This is the infamous 50mm crew served “Knee Mortar” which was in service through out the whole war. This also represents the earlier Type 10 Grenade Discharger which was also in use. The discharger fired both grenades and regular mortar rounds, grenades for the short ranges and mortar rounds for the longer ranges, hence the two effect numbers. Breakdown rate is a Red 5-6 [4-6]. Repair rate is a Black 1-6 and Elimination is a Red 4-6. Close Combat Value is 0. No Secondary Weapons Allowed. No Moving fire. Range, To-Hit, and Effect Numbers as follows: Range 0 – NA/2 FP – NA Range 1 – 0-3 [0-2] – 1 Range 2 – 0-2 [0-1] – 1 Range 3 – 0-1 [0] – 2 Range 4 – 0 [1] – 2 Range 5 – 1 [3] – 2 Type 11 70mm Medium Mortar – This was the first mortar that the Japanese ever made. It was a crew served 70mm mortar which had been in service since 1921. By 1941 it had been replaced by more modern medium mortars and was largely used in 2nd Line and Reserve units. It was used to the end of the war. Effect Number is 3. Morale Value is 5. Panic Value is 5. Rout: 0r RNC&gt; 7. CCV: 5/5. Pinned CCV: 1/1. KIA: 9. Pinned KIA: 9. Pinned requires RALLY 3. No Moving Fire. Range and To-Hit Numbers as follows: Range 0 – NA/5 FP Range 1 – NA/3 FP Range 2 – 0-3 Range 3 – 0-2 Range 4 – 0-1 Range 5 – 0 Type 97 81mm Medium Mortar – This is the crew served 81mm medium mortar which served in the Japanese Army through out the war. The similar Type 3 Model served in the Japanese Navy’s SNLF troops. This mortar was used in Japanese 1st Line units. Effect Number is 4. Morale Value is 5. Panic Value is 5. Rout: 0r RNC&gt;7. CCV: 5/5. Pinned CCV: 1/1. KIA: 9. Pinned KIA: 9. Pinned requires RALLY 3. No Moving fire. Range and To-Hit Numbers as follows: Range 0 – NA/5 FP Range 1 – NA/3 FP Range 2 – 0-3 Range 3 – 0-2 Range 4 – 0-1 Range 5 – 0 Type 94 90mm Medium Mortar – This is the crew served 90mm medium mortar which served in the Japanese Army through out the war. This also includes the later Type 97 mortar which was a modified Type 94 made simpler for ease of production. These were a sort of “heavy” medium mortar which the Japanese designed to be used in difficult terrain where regular artillery could not deploy. While these were usually used in China, they were also used in the Japanese conquest of the Philippines and in the Guadalcanal campaign. After that they were encountered on various islands that had difficult terrain when the Allies were on the offensive. This is a heavy gun and can not be moved in the game. Effect Number is 5. Morale Value is 5. Panic Value is 5. Rout: 0r RNC&gt;7. CCV: 5/5. Pinned CCV: 1/1. KIA: 9. Pinned KIA: 9. Pinned requires RALLY 3. Range and To-Hit Numbers as follows: Range 0 – NA/5 FP Range 1 – NA/3 FP Range 2 – NA/2 FP Range 3 – 0-2 Range 4 – 0-1 Range 5 – 0 Type 96 25mm Anti-Aircraft/Anti-Tank Gun – This is the crew served 25mm anti-aircraft/anti-tank gun which was used by the Japanese Navy’s SNLF troops through out the war. Though its primary use was for anti-aircraft, it was also designed to double as an anti-tank gun and in practice was effective against lightly armored vehicles. However against the better armored Allied medium tanks it encountered later in the war it was a failure. While the gun came in single, double, and triple permanent mountings, it also came in a single gun wheeled carriage and that is what is being presented here. Note that the wheeled version had no armored gun shield. Effect Numbers are 1 and Boxed 0. Morale Value is 5. Panic Value is 5. Rout: 0r RNC&gt;7. CCV: 5/5. Pinned CCV: 1/1. KIA: 9. Pinned KIA: 9. Pinned requires RALLY 3. No Moving Fire. Type 94 37mm Anti-Tank Gun – This is the crew served 37mm anti-tank gun which was in service in the Japanese Army through out the war. Although it was originally assigned to all units, when the later Type 1 entered service it was largely used by the 2nd Line and Reserve units. While pretty effective against lightly armored vehicles, it was totally ineffective against the later Allied medium tanks it went against. Effect Numbers are 1 and Boxed 1. Morale Values are 5 and Boxed 3. Panic Values are 5 and Boxed 3. Rout: 0r RNC&gt;7. CCV: 5/5. Pinned CCV: 1/1. KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned requires RALLY 3. No Moving Fire. Type 1 47mm Anti-Tank Gun – This is the crew served 47mm anti-tank gun which served in the Japanese Army from 1942 to the end of the war. It was largely assigned to the 1st Line formations, thus supplanting the older Type 94 AT guns there. While it could defeat the armor on the various Allied light tanks, it was only marginally effective against the armor of the later Allied medium tanks. Effect Numbers are 2 and Boxed 2. Morale Values are 5 and Boxed 3. Panic Values are 5 and Boxed 3. Rout: 0r RNC&gt;7. CCV: 5/5. Pinned CCV: 1/1. KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned requires RALLY 3. No Moving Fire. Type 11 37mm Infantry Gun – This is the crew served 37mm infantry gun which served in the Japanese Army through out the war. It was based on the French 37mm Infantry Gun Model 1916. Besides being an infantry gun, it also doubled as an anti-tank gun. However by 1941 it had been replaced by more modern designs and it was usually found in the Reserve units during the war. Note that this gun had no armored gun shield. Effect Numbers are 1 and Boxed 1. Morale Value is 5. Panic Value is 5. Rout: 0r RNC&gt;7. CCV: 5/5. Pinned CCV: 1/1. KIA: 9. Pinned KIA: 9. Pinned requires RALLY 3. No Moving Fire. Type 92 70mm Infantry Gun – This is the crew served 70mm infantry gun which served in the Japanese Army through out the war. This also represents the Type 94 75mm Mountain Gun. Both guns took the place of both the Type 11 infantry gun and the Type 11 medium mortar in the 1st Line units. Effect Numbers are 4 and Boxed 2. Morale Values are 5 and Boxed 3. Panic Values are 5 and Boxed 3. Rout: 0r RNC&gt;7. KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned requires RALLY 3. No Moving Fire. ITALIAN Brixia Model 35 45mm Light Mortar – This is the crew served 45mm light mortar which served in the Italian Army through out their part in the war. While it had a good rate of fire and was able to cover most ranges well, it had a weak round which detracted from its overall performance. Effect Number is 1. Breakdown Rate is a Red 5-6 [4-6]. Repair rate is Black 1-6 and Elimination is a Red 4-6. Close Combat Value is 0. No Secondary Weapons Allowed. No Moving Fire. Model 35 81mm Medium Mortar – This is the crew served 81mm medium mortar which served in the Italian Army through out their part in the war. It was actually one of the better mortars in the medium category. Effect Number is 4. Morale Value is 5. Panic Value is 4. Rout: 0r RNC&gt;3. CCV: 5/5. Pinned CCV: 1/1. KIA: 9. Pinned KIA: 9. Pinned requires RALLY 3. No Moving Fire. Range and To-Hit Numbers as Follows: Range 0 – NA/5 FP Range 1 – NA/3 FP Range 2 – 0-3 Range 3 – 0-2 Range 4 – 0-1 Range 5 – 0 Breda Model 35 20mm Anti-Aircraft/Anti-Tank Gun – This is the crew served 20mm anti-aircraft/anti-tank gun in Italian service through out its part in the war. As an anti-tank gun it did well against lightly armored vehicles but poorly against even the moderately armored tanks of the mid war period. Effect Numbers are 1 and Boxed 0. Breakdown rate is a Red 4-6. Morale Values are 5 and Boxed 3. Panic Values are 4 and Boxed 2. Rout: 0r RNC&gt;3. CCV: 5/5. Pinned CCV: 1/1. KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned requires RALLY 3. No Moving Fire. Model 35 47mm Anti-Tank Gun – This is the crew served 47mm anti-tank gun in Italian service through out its part in the war. This was a combination anti-tank/Infantry gun and it worked well in both roles. It was also used by the Finns and the Romanians. However, despite how it was portrayed in the previous Editions of Up Front, the 47mm ATG never had an armored gun shield and so will no longer have a boxed Morale, Panic, and KIA rating. Effect Numbers are 2 and Boxed 2. Morale Value is 5. Panic Value is 4. Rout: 0r RNC&gt;3. CCV: 5/5. Pinned CCV: 1/1. KIA: 9. Pinned KIA: 9. Pinned requires RALLY 3. No Moving Fire. Model 13 65mm Infantry Gun – This is the crew served 65mm infantry/mountain gun in Italian service through out its part in the war. It worked well in both roles and even did yeoman work as an anti-tank gun in North Africa. Effect Numbers are 3 and Boxed 1. Morale Values are 5 and Boxed 3. Panic Values are 4 and Boxed 2. Rout: 0r RNC&gt;3. CCV: 5/5. Pinned CCV: 1/1. KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned requires RALLY 3. No Moving Fire. Model 37 75mm Field Gun – This is the crew served 75mm field gun in Italian service through out their part in the war. Besides being a field gun, it was also used as an anti-tank gun in North Africa as it had an anti-tank round. Effect Numbers are 4 and Boxed 4. Morale Values are 5 and Boxed 3. Panic Values are 4 and Boxed 2. Rout: 0r RNC&gt;3. CCV: 5/5. Pinned CCV: 1/1. KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned requires RALLY 3. No Moving Fire. FRENCH Model 37 50mm Light Mortar – This is the crew served 50mm light mortar in French service during the early part of the war. It was a platoon level weapon but only the 1st Line Divisions received it and not all infantry platoons received one by the time the Battle of France started. After the Fall of France the 50mm mortar fell out of favor with the French and it wasn’t used anymore. Effect Number is 2. Breakdown rate is a Red 5-6 [4-6]. Repair rate is a Black 1-6 and Elimination is a Red 4-6. Close Combat Value is 0. No Secondary Weapons Allowed. No Moving fire. Range and To-Hit Numbers as follows: Range 0 – NA/2 FP Range 1 – 0-3 [0-1] Range 2 – 0-2 [0] Range 3 – 0-1 [1] Range 4 – 0 [2] Range 5 – 1 [3] Model 35 60mm Light Mortar – This is the crew served 60mm light mortar that served in the French, Vichy French, and Free French Forces through out the war, both in its original form and in the Lend Lease American M2 Light Mortar (which was a licensed copy of the French version). It was a company level weapon and all 1st Line Divisions and most 2nd Line Divisions were equipped with this mortar. Effect Number is 3. Breakdown rate is a Red 5-6 [4-6]. Repair rate is a Black 1-6 and Elimination is a Red 4-6. Close Combat Value is 0. No Secondary Weapons Allowed. No Moving Fire. Range and To-Hit Numbers as follows: Range 0 – NA/2 FP Range 1 – NA/1 FP Range 2 – 0-3 [0-1] Range 3 – 0-2 [0] Range 4 – 0-1 [1] Range 5 – 0 [2] Model 27/31 81mm Medium Mortar – This is the crew served 81mm medium mortar that served in the French, Vichy French, and Free French forces through out the war, both in its original form and in the Lend Lease American M1 Medium Mortar (which was a licensed copy of the French version). It was a battalion level weapon in the French forces. Effect Number is 4. Morale Value is 5. Panic Value is 6. Rout: 0r RNC&gt;6. CCV: 5/5. Pinned CCV: 1/1. KIA: 9. Pinned KIA: 9. Pinned requires RALLY 3. No Moving Fire. Range and To-Hit Numbers as follows: Range 0 – NA/5 FP Range 1 – NA/3 FP Range 2 – 0-3 Range 3 – 0-2 Range 4 – 0-1 Range 5 – 0 Model 34 25mm Anti-Tank Gun – This is the crew served 25mm anti-tank gun in French service in the early part of the war. It was the main anti-tank gun in the French Army in 1940. It was also used by the Finns and Romanians during the war and the British in the British Expeditionary Force in France in 1940. After the fall of France in 1940, the Germans confiscated all 25mm ATG’s and what they did not use themselves, sold the rest to foreign countries. It appears that the Vichy and Free French did not use this gun. Effect Numbers are 1 and Boxed 0. Morale Values are 5 and Boxed 3. Panic Values are 6 and Boxed 4. Rout: 0r RNC&gt;6. CCV: 5/5. Pinned CCV: 1/1. KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned requires RALLY 3. No Moving Fire. Model 16 37mm Infantry Gun – This is the crew served 37mm infantry gun in French service in the early part of the war. This was an old relic from the First World War which served as both an infantry gun and as an anti-tank gun as well. It was also used by the Americans in that war and the Japanese based their Type 11 Infantry Gun on this model. Note that while most pictures of this weapon shows it without a gun shield, by the Second World War those Model 16’s still in French service were equipped with gun shields and thus do get the boxed values for Morale, Panic and KIA ratings. After the fall of France in 1940, the Germans confiscated most of the 37mm IG’s for themselves for use by the occupation forces in France, leaving only a few to be used by the Vichy French. It appears that the Free French did not use this gun. Effect Numbers are 1 and Boxed 1. Morale Values are 5 and Boxed 3. Panic Values are 6 and Boxed 4. Rout: 0r RNC&gt;6. CCV: 5/5. Pinned CCV: 1/1. KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned requires Rally 3. No Moving Fire. Model 37 47mm Anti-Tank Gun – This is the crew served 47mm anti-tank gun in French service in the early part of the war. Only a few hundred were in service in May 1940 and all were confiscated by the Germans for use in their own forces after the fall of France. Neither the Vichy nor the Free French ever used these guns. Effect Numbers are 2 and Boxed 2. Morale Values are 5 and Boxed 3. Panic Values are 6 and Boxed 4. Rout: 0r RNC&gt;6. CCV: 5/5. Pinned CCV: 1/1. KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned requires Rally 3. No Moving Fire. QF 6 Pounder Anti-Tank Gun – In 1943 the British supplied the 6 Pounder ATG to the Free French Forces. All the values on the card would be the same under French service as they would under British. M1 57mm Anti-Tank Gun – In 1944 the Americans were totally re-equipping the Free French forces (except the French Commando who stayed under British supply) and so the 57mm ATG became the main anti-tank gun of the Free French forces. Under French service the Morale Numbers would be 5 and Boxed 3, the CCV: 5/5, The Pinned CCV: 1/1. Model 97/38 75mm Field Gun – This is the famous French crew served 75mm field gun. Although the picture on the card shows its WW1 configuration, during the 1930s several thousand guns were upgraded with split trails, rubber tires, and increased elevation and traverse capabilities, thus extending its service life into the Second World War. It also doubled as an anti-tank gun however its performance was poor in that regard during the battle for France in 1940, given a poor AT shell then in service. However in North Africa its performance improved due to better AP rounds produced by the Americans and supplied through Lend Lease. It was also in service with the British, Americans, Poles, Belgians, Spanish, and Portuguese at the beginning of the war. The Germans confiscated hundreds of these after the fall of France and converted them to an anti-tank gun, which they used themselves and also sold to the Finns and the Romanians. During the mid war years it was used by both the Vichy and Free French forces. Effect Numbers are 4 and Boxed 4. Morale Values are 5 and Boxed 3. Panic Values are 4 and Boxed 6. Rout: 0r RNC&gt;6. CCV: 5/5. Pinned CCV: 1/1. KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned KIA: 9 and Boxed 7. Pinned requires RALLY 3. No Moving Fire. Note: After the Liberation of France in 1944, the French recovered much of their old equipment that was confiscated by the Germans in 1940. However, since the main Free French force, the First French Army, was being American supplied and using American equipment, it was decided that the recaptured guns would be used to equip reserve French units on duty on secondary fronts. Here is an excerpt of the write up that Alan Arvold has provided for us in creating the alternate weapons. This is NOT a complete list, not fully playtested yet and therefore NOT final yet. This is intended to give you all an idea of what we are doing with the alternate weapons. Pistols: All pistols have firepower factors of 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, and 0. Breakdown rate is a Red 6. Repair rate is a Black 0-6 and Elimination is a Red 5-6. Close Combat Value is 0. GERMAN Gewehr 41w – A semi-automatic rifle of the Wehrmacht in the middle of the war. Only about 150,000 were produced and it was only used on the Eastern Front. Has a breakdown rate of a Red 5, or 6. Repair rate is a Black 0-6 and Elimination is a Red 5-6. Gewehr 43 – An improved semi-automatic carbine version of the Gewehr 41. In service from 1943 to the end of the war, about 400,000 were produced. Was supposed to be two per squad in both the Wehrmacht and SS but production never reached these goals and usually one showed up if it showed up at all and it was usually a squad leader’s weapon. Firepower factors are 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, and 0. FG42 – A minority assault rifle/light machine gun that was used only by the German airborne forces from 1944 to the end of the war. Took the place of the machine gun in the squad. Only about 2,000 were produced. Firepower factors are 6, 6, 5, 4, 3, and 1. AMERICAN M12 Shotgun – The US Armed Forces used several militarized models of shotguns, the most common was the M12. The Army only used them on the home front but the Marines did use them in the Pacific during the war. Firepower factors are 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, and 0. Breakdown rate is a Red 6. Repair rate is a Red 0 and a Black 0-6 and Elimination is a Red 6. Close Combat Value is 5. M3 “Grease Gun” – Supplemental sub-machine gun meant to replace the Thompson but never did during the war. This would also include the later M3A1 model. Was used by rear area troops but by late 1944 front line troops started to receive them in place of the Thompson. M50 Reising – Another supplemental sub-machine gun used during the war. Was used by the Marine special forces (Raider and Paramarines) in 1942 in place of the Thompson but by early 1943 was withdrawn from front line service and most were sent back home. Main reason for its early retirement from front line service was the moderate malfunction probability, which was worse than the Thompson. Therefore its breakdown rate is a Red 5 or 6. M1940 Johnson LMG – A light machine gun that saw service in both the Marines and the Army during the war. In the Marines it was used in their Special Forces (Raiders and Paramarines) in 1942 but phased out by the middle of 1943. The Army used it in its Special Forces (Rangers and Devil’s Brigade) through out the war in place of the BAR although the Rangers also used the BAR. Firepower factors are 6, 5, 5, 4, 3, 3. Breakdown is a Red 6. Repair rate is a Black 0-6 and Elimination is a Red 5-6. Close Combat Value is 2. SOVIET UNION PPD-40 – Early submachine gun that the Red Army used in the Winter War and the first year of the main war. Was more complicated than the later PPSh 41 and as that gun entered service the remaining PPD-40s were withdrawn from front line service and reserved for internal security and NVKD forces. PPS – A low cost submachine gun meant for reconnaissance troops, vehicle crews, and rear area troops but was used by front line troops as well. Had a box magazine as opposed to the PPSh-41 which had a drum magazine. First entered service in early 1942 and served the entire war. BRITISH Thompson SMG – The American Thompson SMG in British service. It was used from 1941 to the end of the war. Mostly found in the Commandos and other Special Forces but also found in the line infantry mostly during 1941-43 until enough Stens were produced to replace it. Repair rate is a Black 1-6. JAPANESE Nambu 94 – A small semi-automatic pistol that was used by weapons crews, aircrews, and AFV crews during the war. By late war it was also issued to NCOs as a substitute for the Nambu 14. Note: This pistol has a trigger bar mounted on its left side that made it a very dangerous weapon when loaded with a round in the chamber as an accidental bump against it could set it off. While the safety when engaged was supposed to prevent this from happening quite frequently it did not. Breakdown rate of a Red 5 or 6. Captured Rifles: While it is true that all of the major and minor powers used captured weapons to some extent during the war, but was done on a unit by unit basis and not as a matter of army wide policy. The Japanese were the exception to this as they made a very liberal use of captured weapons in the latter part of the war when normal war production could no longer keep up with demand. The following captured rifles came from surrendered American and British forces from early in the war. In Up Front terms, one would not find more than one Japanese soldier armed with a captured weapon in any scenario and thus this should be restricted to DYO. M1903 Springfield – These were captured Springfield rifles pressed into service in the latter part of the war. Mostly used by units facing American forces. Lee-Enfield Rifle – These were captured Lee-Enfield rifles pressed into service in the latter part of the war. Mostly used by units facing British/Commonwealth forces. M1928A1 SMG – Captured American Thompsons pressed into service in 1944. About 100 were captured in the early part of the war so this was a very rare SMG. However they were recaptured by American forces in just about every one of the island assaults in 1944 and 45 and also in the Philippines so they were out there. Close Combat Value is 3. Nambu Type 99 LMG – This was the modified Type 96 which fired the 7.7mm round. It became the main LMG in the Japanese Armed Services by 1943. It was issued to squads which were armed with the 7.7mm Arisaki rifle. The extraction problem was fixed in this model and so it has a normal breakdown rate of a Red 6. Nambu Type 11 LMG – An older 6.5mm LMG that served in the Japanese Armed Forces through out the war. Like the Type 96 it was only issued to squads armed with the Model 38 rifle. It too had a bad extraction system which led to frequent malfunctions which is why it has a breakdown rate of Red 5 or 6. M1918A1 BAR – Captured American BAR’s which were pressed into service in 1944 which was issued to units facing American units. Again these were recovered by American forces in the latter part of the war but in far less frequency than the Thompson SMG’s. Firepower factors are 5, 4, 4, 3, 3, and 2. Breakdown rate is a Red 6. Lewis LMG – Captured British Lewis LMG’s pressed into service in 1944 issued to units facing British/Commonwealth forces. These were recovered by British/Commonwealth forces in the latter part of the war in about the same frequency as the BAR. Breakdown rate is Red 6. Close Combat Value is 1. FRENCH Berthier Rifle – An older series of bolt action rifles and carbines in French service. The older models were originally 8mm and had a 3 round magazine. However in the early 1930’s new models of both the rifle and the carbine came out in 7.5mm and with a 5 round magazine. Was used to equip the 2nd Line and Colonial troops in the French Army and was also used in the French Foreign Legion. Lebel Model 1886 – Another series of older bolt action rifles and carbines of pre-World War 1 manufacture. Originally in 8mm, in the 1930’s the last models in production fired the 7.5mm round. Also used in the 2nd Line units in World War 2. M1917 Enfield – As the war dragged on and the supply of the MAS 36 rifles shrank, the British supplied the Free French with the M1917 Enfield, which they in turn had bought from the United States. When the Americans took over the task of re-equipping the entire Free French Army in early 1944 they continued the issuing of the Enfield to the Free French which the French used in their 1st Line units, leaving all other rifles for the secondary and rear area units. MAS-38 SMG – A 7.65mm sub-machine gun which was just entering production when the war began. Only about 2,000 were made before the Fall of France and were used mainly by the French National Guard units. After the fall of France it was used by the Vichy French, the Free French, and the French Resistance but it was a rare gun whose numbers dwindled as the war dragged on. Sten SMG – After the Fall of France the British took over the task of supplying the Free French and the Sten was used to replace the MAS-38. The Repair rate is a Black 0-6. M1928A1 Thompson – When the Americans took over the job of supplying the Free French in 1944, the M1928A1 Thompson took the place of the Sten except in the French Commandos who kept the Sten. M1918A2 BAR – When the Americans started supplying the Free French forces in 1944 they offered the BAR to the French as the squad automatic weapon but the French preferred the Me 24/29 instead. Still there were times in 1944-45 that the Me 24/29 was in short supply and the Free French used the BAR in its place but only as a temporary measure. Firepower factors are 5, 4, 4, 3, 3, and 2. The Breakdown rate is a Red 6. The Repair rate is a Black 0-6 and Elimination is a Red 5-6. Close Combat Value is 2. ITALIAN Still in development... As we approach the end of the campaign, it is time to remind all the supporters that will have their product shipped to a location outside the United States that shipping needs to be added to your pledge at the time of placing the pledge. Kickstarter does not allow us to go back later and simply charge the shipping to you if you forgot to do it and sending emails to each supporter who did not pay for shipping and organizing PayPal payments after the campaign is a frustrating process for both us and the supporter. So, if you are a Canadian, European or International supporter AND intend you have your product shipped to a location outside the United States please take the time to ensure you added your shipping to you pledge. If you did not, please adjust your pledge to ensure it now includes shipping fees. As a reminder, the shipping fees are as follows; Canada - $10 shipping for first complete tier and $5 for each additional complete tier (to a maximum of two additional copies). Europe - $35 shipping for first complete tier and $20 for each additional complete tier (to a maximum of two additional copies). International (other than Europe) - $45 shipping for first complete tier and $25 for each additional complete tier (to a maximum of two additional copies). Thank you so much for your support and understanding. And here is how we plan to commemorate the Band of Brothers... &lt;edit - this is not the final soldier image&gt; Note, in all cases the cards will have rounded corners. So, as we have mentioned in the comments, we would have posted these images earlier but due to all the positive response that Lana Knoll's AFV cards received on Board Game Geek, we asked her to come on board and work with us to come to a design that all would like. This was not as quick a process as one might think it would have been as there were a few card sizes and configurations that were tossed around. Throughout this campaign we have read ALL (yes, ALL) the comments on font choice, font size, card size, orientation, table real estate, sleeve compatability etc... All good points but only one format can be produced. In the end, we chose a 54 x 80 mm card for the Personality and Weapon cards now as it minimizes dead space on the cards, maximizes presentation of Ron Volstad's artwork and minimizes table space requirements. This size is available in sleeves as it is the standard size for Settlers of Catan resource cards and Settlers is a fairly well supported game. We are showing the Personality cards combined with Weapon cards so that all can see how they will look when paired together on the table. As requested, the image was moved up to allow more of the Weapon card to be hidden by players who have limited table space. We are showing you the arrangement with image completely hidden, image showing and then with a malfunctioned weapon. Again, this is NOT final but we are pretty darned close. It looks like the Captain tiers for Australia are sold out now to! So, we have now opened 8 more LTC - AUSTRALIA slots on a first come, first served basis to enable others to also have their chance to get their name printed on a personality card but as a Private First Class. Private First Class rank (or its nation's equivalent) are typically the soldiers that carry the non-rifle/carbine/machine pistol weapons. Thus if you want your soldier to have a chance at carrying a flamethrower, LMG, MMG, ATR, etc in the standard scenarios, then this is your opportunity. They are priced at $325. Thank you so much for your continued support. Sorry for the delay in responding to this. This crossover will involve two tiles called "battle fields", some AIYP weapon cards and some scenarios. A game will play just like existing head-to-head scenarios but involves the process of mustering your squad AND finding weapons to equip your squad. At game start, you only have basic rifle and/or machine pistols and a number of soldiers equal to your health. If a player finds the battle field, they don't have to end their turn there necessarily if they feel they are not well enough equipped or have not mustered enough of a squad. However, the first player to end their turn on the battle field has initiative and can decide who goes first. It is a small game that is played to decide your starting units and weapons. Likely, there will be either a squad with numbers and basic weapons or a squad with lower numbers and better weapons. Will some games start uneven? Of course! When's the last time you planned your own ambush? A small gift from Rik and Torben at Radiant Gaming. Wishing you all a fun-filled and safe holiday and all the best in the coming year. Thanks for all your comments on the AFV card layouts. Please keep in mind we have already said that we have removed the rivets and increased the font size on AFV cards. We have seen the third party mock up and yes, it looks good but we will not be using it. There are two things that it does not accommodate for; long named AFVs which will run over the image and no room for rules reminders. Also, our team (which involves BOTH a graphic designer and a type setter) has chosen a more graphic background instead of just white. However, we will be making the background lighter. We have customized the Gunplay font to make it more legible and we have replaced it all together with Myriad Pro in the reminder text section. We understand there are lots of graphic designers that can make some good looking cards but we are not opening up submissions because we know that our final decision will still not be liked by all. We have a team and we trust the team will deliver. We have listened to all your comments and will make (already have made) improvements to the cards. Now, let's turn our focus back to getting USMC before the end of the world and the bag by campaign end :-) Thanks so much again for all your support. The UP FRONT team. Sooo sorry everyone, had some "logistics" issues I had to deal with regarding kids :-( Soldiers, support has arrived! Well, we think so. So, after much review of comments out there and discussion within the UP FRONT team, here are the rewards we are adding (with existing rewards highlighted in bold within); $187,500 - Third set of tokens (can we say UP FRONT night?) $192,500 - Alternate Cower Replacement Cards $200,000 - Leather Rulebook $210,000 - Heavy Machine Guns (HMGs) $220,000 - Additional AFVs (Amphibious Vehicles, APCs, Flail Tanks, Multi-Turreted Tanks, Soft Skin Vehicles) $230,000 - Medics and Minesweepers $240,000 - Alternate Weapons (these are the less commonly used weapons but allow for some more accurate reenactment of specific DYO scenarios) $250,000 - Devil's Brigade + Mountain Action Deck (how awesome is that!?!) $260,000 - Rifle Grenade Launchers $270,000 - Heavy Mortars $275,000 - Canvas Carry Bag Thanks so much for your support and like we said, we want you to get that canvas bag as much as you want it. "Sergeant, we're not going to make it! We need more support!" "Private, get on the radio and tell the men that Command has responded. Support is coming!" Hope this helps :-) Lots of demand for China. Lots of demand for many other nations actually but unfortunately, we are nearing unmanageable weight limits for this game with the card count :-) :-( We are currently working on the logistics of another campaign very shortly after this one that will allow you to pledge for; Korean War (done) (will allow for a China for both WWII and Korean war) Indo-China War (done) Arab-Israeli War (mostly done) Spanish Civil War (being considered) These are not being included in the UP FRONT campaign because of weight concerns but also because they are separate wars and we decided to leave this campaign for World War II. Be sure you are heard :-) <url>"UP FRONT" on the cover) with the rules in it, complete with section tabs, to allow for errata if (OK, when) it happens to be included? This way, we could release official updates of the rules, all formated to the original size and appearance, enabling people to just print the pages they need in the binder. Talk about a living rulebook! However, this would be slightly less exclusive as now anyone can go out and get a nice zippered binder but theirs wouldn't have "UP FRONT" in gold leaf on the front AND they'd have to pay a fortune to print all those pages in full color and then trim them to not have any white borders on the pages. * *EDIT * - The current leather-bound rulebook we are offering likely will not fit in the box and neither will the zippered binder. Both will be too thick as they will be thicker than the 10" x 10" base rulebook that will be included. Yes? No? It looks like the Captain tiers for Canada are sold out. WOW! We have had some requests to open up more Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) slots to enable others to also have their chance to get their name printed on a personality card but as a Private First Class. Private First Class rank (or its nation's equivalent) are typically the soldiers that carry the non-rifle/carbine/machine pistol weapons. Thus if you want your soldier to have a chance at carrying a flamethrower, LMG, MMG, ATR, etc in the standard scenarios, then this is your opportunity. So, we will be opening more on Wednesday, December 19, 5:00 PM EST. Due to the demand these have gained, we want to put all pledgers on the same level playing field in terms of opportunity to get them. This time was chosen because it covers a time when most can be awake to respond. It will be first come, first served. This will be for the Canadians only and 5 spots will be available. They will be priced at $325. Thank you so much for your continued support. Here are the group tokens. OK, so from what we are reading, it looks like there might be some misunderstanding around the effect the various action decks will have in a game of UP FRONT. The one thing that will not change from deck to deck is the RPC/RNC numbers. All those will stay balanced in order to keep the statistical chances of random events occurring the same across each deck. What does change significantly though are the terrains AND the effect they have on the game. So, if there are 2 marsh cards in the country deck this does not necessarily mean that there will only be 2 deep snow (the equivalent of a marsh) in the winter deck. There might be 3 deep snow but only 3 brush (as opposed to the normal 4). Also, the inability to repair a malfunctioned weapon in the marsh does not apply in the snow. Another example would be in the city deck and the swap out of marsh for rubble. Both hinder movement, but again you can repair a weapon in rubble AND you can entrench in rubble which you cannot do in the marsh. We hope this illustrates that the various action decks are not just straight swap outs and redresses. They each will play very differently and offer a much improved game experience in UP FRONT to better simulate the various theatres of WWII. As an added incentive to get us at least to Poland, we have added a little special to the $150,000 reward. Also, we want you all to have that canvas bag as much as you all want it. So, no more sleeves and the canvas bag instead. Not only that, we've moved it $25,000 closer. C'mon everyone, tell two friends... Thanks so much for your support! Here are previews of how the terrain cards will look. Please note, this is the final layout and art. However, these are NOT yet final in terms of wording hence the "protoype" on the bottom of the card. Thank you so much for being patient everyone. Attached is a preview of how the rules will read in our edition of Up Front. This is section B. Game Concepts and section C. Basic Game Rules . Please note, this is just to show you all how the rules will be written and what size paper they will be presented on. This is NOT the final graphics. Will show some final Action Cards shortly... Click here to see rules . For those of you who are worried that the SS Pack may cause issues with your customs, we will put a question on the campaign-end survey that lets you opt out of the SS Pack. If you opt out, you will receive all the stretch rewards EXCEPT the SS Pack and thereby avoid any potential issues through customs. Here is a sneak peak of what the weapons cards will look like. We know you all have been eagerly anticipating some final art. Unfortunately, Ron has been quite under the weather of late (as has most of Southern Alberta recently) and we would rather he just get better than push himself and have the cold drag on. Anyways, the first art board of 14 US soldiers is completed and the next step is to paint it. We promise, as soon as we have more to show, you will all be the first to know about it. Thanks so much for you support everyone and let's keep this campaign moving upwards. In response to questions regarding the difference between Private and Private First Class from a game point of view. Private First Class rank (or its nation's equivalent) are typically the soldiers that carry the non-rifle/carbine/machine pistol weapons. Thus if you want your soldier to have a chance at carrying a flamethrower, LMG, MMG, ATR, etc in the standard scenarios, then this is your opportunity. Don't forget, today at 5 PM EST we will open more tiers for supporters to get their name printed on a Private First Class rank personality card in Up Front. The nationalities that will be opened will be; Britain Germany USMC To clarify, expansions will only be published IF the stretch goal is obtained. Then, at some later date, they will be released to retail and sold to public. However, if the stretch goal is NOT reached, that expansion will not be published. Not even at a later date as printing a tiny expansion all on its own is not economical. The only items that are guaranteed to be printed are the base game, 5 major nationalities and the stretch goals we reach. All of which will be available in retail at some point later. Kickstarter supporters, however, get it all arriving at the same time in one big happy box. Well, the Captain tiers went really fast for USMC, German and British. USMC went in less than 10 minutes!?! We have had some requests to open up more Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) slots to enable others to also have their chance to get their name printed on a personality card but as a Private First Class. So, we will be opening more on Wednesday, December 5, 5 :00 PM EST . Due to the demand these have gained, we want to put all pledgers on the same level playing field in terms of opportunity to get them. This time was choosen because it covers a time when most can be awake to respond. It will be first come, first served. There will be a tier for USMC, German and British only and there will be 10 spots availalbe in each. They will be priced at $325. Thank you so much for your support UP FRONT TEAM Good day all. We are receiving a fair number of emails from people in the miltary stating that they just stumbled across this and were very interested. We got many similar emails during our Airborne In Your Pocket and D-Day Dice campaigns. So, our question is, "How do we give this game more direct exposure to those men and women in the military? Don't forget, today at 5 PM EST we will open more tiers for supporters to get their name printed on a Private rank personality card in Up Front. There will be LOTS of tiers due to all the nationalities and we will likely win an award for most tiers ever in a Kickstarter campagin :-) :-( The nationalities that will be opened will be; Australia Britain Canada Finland France German SS Germany Greece Hungary Italy Italian Folgore Japan Norway Poland Romania Soviet Union Tito`s Partisans USMC We will also open up two more BIG tiers that will enable you to have Ron Volstad draw your likeness on a soldier that will appear in the game on a nationality of your choice. These tiers will be as follows; Pledge $1500 or more 5 backers MAJOR GENERAL - You will receive 3 signed copies of the base game of Up Front (US vs. Germany) AND 3 copies of all 5 additional nationalities (Britain, France, Italy, Japan and Soviet Union) AND the UP FRONT cloth patch AND a numbered signed print of the new Up Front cover painting by Ron Volstad AND your name on a personality card (you choose which nationality and the name must be reasonable for the nationality and reasonable in general) AND you will be able to send in a photo of your choice and Ron Volstad will draw your likeness on a soldier that will appear in the game. Due to the nature of the game, only an appropriate male photo can be used and more than one photo may be required before Ron deems a photo suitable to use. Pledge $2000 or more 5 backers LIEUTENANT GENERAL - You will receive 3 signed copies of the base game of Up Front (US vs. Germany) AND 3 copies of all 5 additional nationalities (Britain, France, Italy, Japan and Soviet Union) AND the UP FRONT cloth patch AND a numbered signed print of the new Up Front cover painting by Ron Volstad AND your name on a personality card (you choose which nationality and the name must be reasonable for the nationality and reasonable in general) AND you will be able to send in a photo of your choice and Ron Volstad will draw your likeness on a soldier that will appear in the game AND you will receive the original drawing by Ron Volstad of your likeness used in the game. The original artwork will come signed, matted and framed. Due to the nature of the game, only an appropriate male photo can be used and more than one photo may be required before Ron deems a photo suitable to use. Good day all. Last evening I went for a visit to Ron Volstad's studio both to say hi (since I was in Edmonton), see his studio and get a feel of how Up Front art was progressing. You all know there will be a LOT of soldier and AFV art that Ron has to do for this game so Ron has been working on a method that will best enable him to "mass produce" hundreds of unique little soldier and AFV paintings. Unfortunately, he doesn't have any final paints yet but those should roll in soon as he has finished setting up a dedicated board just for Up Front and he has the majority of the US soldiers penciled now. The studio is amazing with 1000s of reference books, and closets full of ORIGINAL WWII uniforms that his models wear for his photo shoots. Below are a couple shots of the studio. We know you want to see art everyone but please, a little more patience. Ron will deliver beautiful art for us. A pledger was kind enough to bring it to our attention that the previous time we announced was not so Europe friendly. We will be opening more on Wednesday, November 28, 5:00 PM EST. We want to put all pledgers on the same level playing field in terms of opportunity to get them. This time was choosen because it covers a time when most can be awake to respond. It will be first come, first served. 5:00 PM EST equates to ; North America 2 PM - 6 PM Europe 10 PM - 12 AM Asia-Pac 5 AM - 8 AM We think this is about the best we can do. There will be a tier for EACH nationality and some willl have more available than others The stretch reward nationalities will also be available. This will add a LOT of tiers and many don't like multiple tiers but this is really the only way to do this and be able to track it accurately. Thank you so much for your support UP FRONT TEAM Good day all and let us start by saying just how pleased we are with the response so far! Thank you so much! As for the named personality cards, we will be opening more on Wednesday, November 28, 10:00 PM EST . Due the demand these have gained, we want to put all pledgers on the same level playing field in terms of opportunity to get them. This time was choosen because it covers a time when most can be awake to respond. It will be first come, first served. There will be a tier for EACH nationality and some willl have more available than others The stretch reward nationalities will also be available. This will add a LOT of tiers and many don't like multiple tiers but this is really the only way to do this and be able to track it accurately. Thank you so much for your support UP FRONT TEAM Good day soldiers! We have fixed the issue around needing to state that you are a US resident and now supporters all over the world can pledge on UP FRONT. Thanks for your patience and let's see if we can get the Canucks and Aussies ($60k) to join the batlle real soon. We cannot sell multiples of limited quantity tiers under one username. However , for all the unlimited tiers, you can buy multiples under one pledge. Simply pay the amount for how many copies of the tier you want and the required amount of shipping fees. Shipping for multiple tiers will be discounted slightly as follows; Canada - $10 shipping for first complete tier and $5 for each additional complete tier. Europe - $35 shipping for first complete tier and $20 for each additional complete tier. International (other than Europe) - $45 shipping for first complete tier and $25 for each additional complete tier. WOW, those went fast! With MANY requests to open more of these up we are currently looking into which nationality current supporters are wanting their names on. We realized that not everyone will want their name on a US Personality card but likely most people will. There are only a limited number of personality cards per nationality. So, once we hear from those that have pledged, we will have a better understanding of how many more we can open and potentially what nationalities are no longer available. Thank you so much for your support. Hello everyone an let me begin with a sincere thank you for the support you have offered so far. As for the block that is currently imposed on the tiers for International supporters, we have sent in a request to Kickstarter this. Unfortunately, once a tier receives a pledge it cannot be changed. Will let you know immediately when we hear back from Kickstarter. Thank you for your patience. Sorry, yes we ship internationally. However, you must add the shipping fees for outside the US when you place your pledge. The "Ships in the US only" is referring to the free shipping. Sorry for the confusion.
