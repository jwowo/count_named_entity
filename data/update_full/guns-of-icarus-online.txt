Charging Ahead to Launch... It's been a busy time for us at Muse Games! As we're heading closer to Guns of Icarus Online's September 30 launch date, things are really heating up! We just got back from PAX prime where we met fans and held press previews, the first Guns of Icarus Online tournament is in the works, we're rolling out new features like custom games, spectator mode, a party system, friend lists, and an in-game store, and of course beta testing is ongoing as we continually tweak, balance, refine, and polish the game... Read on to see what we've been up to! Announcing THUNDERDUNES, the first-ever Guns of Icarus Online Tournament! As we hurtle towards launch in the last weeks of beta, it's time for all you airship Captains, Gunners, and Engineers to take to the skies and battle it out for the right to name yourselves CHAMPIONS OF THE DUNES! When: Saturday, September 15, 2pm EST Full details on the tournament page: <url>~ Jess Hi everyone, Guns of Icarus Online is nominated for Notable Kickstarter of the Year in Guild Launch's Dragonslayer Awards at Dragoncon this year!

So all I can really say is, crazy! And we'll be at Pax East. The game will be featured at Kickstarter's room, and we'll be there to demo the game! If you are going to Pax, please stop by and say hi. Next week, we'll have a new trailer ready, so stay tuned for that as well. Thanks! Howard Hi everyone, Great news! We just got the help we needed from Steam to continue work on integration. With this, we can finally proceed to complete the beta process on Steam. We still need to do a bit of work on our end, and I'll keep everyone updated on our progress. They are also helping us to build a coming soon page, so stay tune for that as well. On the gifts front, the captain's logbooks have been ordered, and we are working on sketching in them :) Art book and the USBs are being ordered as well. T-shirts and posters we are still waiting for a few more survey responses to confirm the final count, so if you haven't filled out the survey, please help us fill it out! Thanks everyone for being so patient! Also let me attach some new screenshots from our play test sessions today. Plus a render of more characters and costumes. Check out our blog post for more! <url>’ve got one last chance to get one for you and your friends! We really didn’t expect these packs to sell out like they did, and we’re amazed and delighted at the enthusiastic response. We’ve just got a few days left to go, and when it’s done, our beta enrollment will be pretty much full to bursting! I guess it'll be little to no sleep for while longer, but what else would we rather do anyways! Thank you so much for all your support, feedback, and encouragement, and for pledging and spreading the word. Thanks most of all for putting your trust in us and helping us make this thing happen. It’s gonna be great! Less than a week left - I wonder how far we can get? Howard Hi everyone, We found the custom USB design that we liked finally, and here's the design (Please note that this image is a mockup only!): The actual USB will have the Guns of Icarus Online logo etched, so it will look even better than this. We are still deciding on the art book and working on the male costume design, and we should have another update on those items very soon! Game progress wise, we are continuing to polish up terrain, particle effects, and UI. We are also doing a lot of testing and debugging. We have also done quite a bit of polish work on animations, and here are a few animation samples! Thanks very much! Howard Hi everyone, Thanks again for your support! The Guns of Icarus Online campaign has just reached the $20,000 milestone. We are really excited to have everyone join us in closed-beta. We have also reached out to the awesome people at Valve, and we are working on getting a Coming Soon page up on Steam. As soon as that happens, I will update again. For game progress, we are working on a lot of sound integration, as well as more UI polish. We are also working on testing different PvP maps and just testing by shooting down each other's ships. Here are more screen shots that we took during our test sessions. The missile launcher we are and showing posting for the first time. Enjoy! Best, Howard Hi everyone, Thanks a lot for your patience in waiting for us to decide on the log book and the exclusive costume. We are excited to have finally made our selections! After quite a bit of searching for a good Captain's Log Book and looking at quite a few choices, we've finally decided on the one we wanted. You can see the image of the log book below. It is 4x6, which is a great size for carrying it around, and it features leather covers and classical and clean look. We will also have a special Guns of Icarus Online logo stamped on the inside cover, along with a sketch and a signature by our artists on the first page of each book. The costume we've selected is also on display below. This is one of our favorite costume concepts so far. We only have the female version of the costume right now, but there will be a matching male version, and we will make sure it looks just as good. Thanks very much! Howard Hi everyone, As of today, we've sold out of the First Mate (2 copy pack) and are almost out of the Captain and Crew (4 copy pack). But we are still getting requests for the packs, so we have decided to increase the quantity limit to 100 each. Because the beta list is getting large, and to ensure that we can successfully fulfill the friend pack orders, the 100 limit is likely going to be the most we can do. Thanks so much for everyone's support and sorry in advance for any inconvenience. We are more than excited and can't wait to deliver the beta build for everyone to try. I also included some screenshots we took from this afternoon's test session. Have a great weekend! Howard Hi everyone, We updated the media page of the website t o include new sections dedicated to concept art and renders! The new page has quite a few concept art pieces that we've never shown before, especially some of the ones we did earlier on. It also has some exploratory works that we did on face, skin tones, and character silhouettes to give you more of a glimpse of our development process and how our in-game art evolved. We will be posting more art work there. Leave us a comment and tell us what you like or not like! Thanks very much, until next time, Howard Hi everyone, I know I know, 2nd post in a day... Sorry for the spam, but really proud and excited to note that Guns of Icarus Online is now on the Kickstarter front page! Just want to share the news with everyone. Also, to Jesper and anyone interested, the moddb page is up! <url>
