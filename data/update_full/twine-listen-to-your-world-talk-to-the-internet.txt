It’s been almost two years since we launched Twine on Kickstarter; we couldn’t have done it without your help. Time has flown by since then, and now we’re excited to announce our new Kickstarter campaign! Range. Smart thermometer, smarter cook. Talking to a lot of our Twine users who cared about monitoring temperature, we realized that many of them made food and drink as both professionals and enthusiasts, and wanted to do it better. This struck a chord with those of us who don’t have the cooking intuition that our moms and grandmothers do, but love experimenting in the kitchen, especially with old family recipes. With Range, you can take the guesswork out of cooking. Clip it on or stick it in and set an alert for the desired temperature with the Range app for iOS (we include presets for common uses). While you do the dishes or sip on a well-deserved glass of wine, Range graphs the temperature over time so you can learn and improve from each experiment. Once the temperature is reached and your roast has achieved perfection, Range tells you. You’re already a pro at using your iPhone — Range can help you become a pro at kitchen craft as well. Soon, your home brew will be the talk of the neighborhood. Better throw a few steaks on the grill to feed all your newfound friends. Welcome to the internet of poultry. And beef, and beer, and chocolate... Range has just launched on Kickstarter, and we wanted you to be among the first to know. (And we've included pledge levels with access to the API for the nerds.) If you’re interested, just follow the link above to check it out! Thank you again for supporting us with Twine; we wouldn’t be here today without you! -The Supermechanics Guess what, guys? We have a new sensor ready for you and your Twine! Have you wanted to monitor the temperature in your refrigerator or the deep freezer you keep your ice sculptures in? Have the metal walls been holding you back? The external temperature sensor is perfect for monitoring the temperature in your fridge, freezer, or anywhere else you wouldn’t want to stick your Twine because of a hostile environment or lack of Wi-Fi reception. The external temperature sensor has a 5 ft. cord, is rated for temperatures between -55ºC and 125ºC (-67ºF and 257ºF) with accuracy of +/- 0.5ºC over the entire range, and is water resistant. It draws significantly more power than the other external sensors, so you’ll want to have your Twine connected to external power when you’re using it. Just a reminder: we’ve mailed out all the Twines we have the information for, but there are quite a few stragglers (you know who you are) that we still need address confirmation and/or payment for international shipping from. If you haven’t gotten your Twine yet, email us at <email> so we can send it to you! -The Supermechanics Twine 2.0 Remember when we mentioned we were undertaking a major rework of Twine's radio firmware to improve battery life? It’s here, and it brought some friends! You can start this update from your Account page. Under "Your Twines" you'll see a link to "Upgrade to 2.0 firmware" — tap on that and follow the instructions. The website has been updated as well so make sure you clear your browser’s cache too. Read on to understand all the implications before you upgrade. Battery life With the radio update, we’ve doubled battery life for you. Twine will be able to run 2 months or more on 2 AAA batteries. Of course, your battery life will vary based on how you are using your Twine. Is your Twine happily sitting in your basement waiting to tell you if a flood is coming, or listening for another infrequent event? You’ll get more than 60 days. Do you trigger rules constantly or do a lot of tinkering? Battery life should still be improved, but not dramatically. Of course, if you don’t want to rely on batteries, that's why we gave Twine a micro USB port — you can use it to plug into the wall. The update comes with a change that makes this extended life possible: your Twine’s dashboard will update every 20 minutes. This will not affect how you receive notifications — when your rules are triggered, Twine will notify you right away, same as before. (If you don't mind even less frequent dashboard updates, you can change this to 60 minutes under your Account page for an extra couple of weeks' power.) If you’d like to keep your Twine updating every minute like it does now, you can ignore the update — you just won't get the battery life improvement. Sharing the dashboard You can now share your Twine’s dashboard, or just one sensor. Email a link to a standalone web page, or embed it in your own web page. We even made special widgets for Panic Status Board . In your Twine’s rule page, tap on the “Share” button in the dashboard and check “Let others view my data” to see all these options. Only the people you share the key with will be able to see the data. Don’t want to share anymore? Uncheck the box, and your Twine’s data is private again. Networking improvements and more What else is included in this update? Support for hidden networks (with the 2.0 radio update). Networking improvements for even better reliability. More accurate timekeeping. Quicker triggering of multiple actions. Celsius reporting in rules (if your Twine is already in Celsius, you’ll need to click on the ºC to switch to Fahrenheit and then back to Celsius to enable this). And lots of smaller tweaks to make things better all over the place. Pebble notifications aren’t included in this update. We’ve done everything needed on our end to get it ready, and we’re just waiting on Pebble to finish up. Last but not least, you'll notice that we've exchanged the formerly unwieldy address of Twine's web app for the svelte new <url>’s Day? (Of course he would). Tell us why he deserves a Twine for a chance to win a Twine + full sensor kit (retail value $199.95). All you have to do is follow us (@supermechanical) on Twitter, tweet what your Dad would do with his Twine (or what you'll do for him), and mention @supermechanical by 12:00 noon CST on Friday, June 7th. We’ll announce the winner and ship it out on Monday, June 10th, so you’ll get it in plenty of time for Father’s Day (open to US residents only). When you enter, we’ll send you a 10% off coupon code so even if you don’t win, you can get your dad a Twine! It’s that time of year. As they say, April showers bring May flowers (and flooded basements). Moisture sensor special Twine has already saved Rick and Ken’s basements from extensive damage — yours could be next! Rick sent us this tweet (you can check out how he set up his Twine in his blog ): Do you need a moisture sensor? For the rest of April only, get 10% off a moisture sensor or Twine + moisture sensor kit by entering coupon code SPIDERS at checkout. How-To use the moisture sensor Check out our blog to see how to set up your Twine to monitor your basement for flooding in 3 easy steps. You can also use the Twine to monitor the sump pump in your basement. A moisture detection rule combined with a vibration rule to let you know when/if the pump turned on is the perfect solution for your personal flood zone in one box. Don’t have a basement? Lucky you! You can also use the moisture sensor to monitor your AC drip pan. We post how-tos on our blog every week. See how to turn your Twine into a motion sensor with the Breakout Board, or an exercise bike with the Cloud Shield. What’s coming for Twine: Support for ºC reporting and other surprises will be included in the next update! We received our Pebble last week (it looks great on David’s arm), and we’re working with Pebble to add support for notifications. The Davids are in the middle of a major change in the way Twine's radio subsystem works – this will give Twine a significant boost in battery life. -The Supermechanics A couple things we forgot to mention last week: Long cable special Did you know that we now sell longer cables for your sensors? At 10 feet long (3 meters for our overseas friends), these can reach places the standard cable can't. They're also shielded to ensure signal integrity (which can be a problem at long distances and low power). Keep your Twine high and dry in the basement while the sensor does the dirty work! In honor of adding support for long URLs, we’re running a special on long cables in our store! We’ve dropped the price for everyone, and you’ll get free domestic shipping on long cables if you order by April 6 — this Saturday. Shhh... we're only telling Kickstarter backers. Austin hardware love We love living and working in Austin. Aside from the great food, weather and music, we like it here for the concentration of hardware makers. At SXSW Interactive last month, our pals at the brand new and already excellent ATXHW group put together a hardware Kickstarter Q&amp;A, and John got to take part alongside some of Austin's finest. Read more at MakeBlog. We want to give a shout-out to them — if you like what they're making, get yourself some new gear and support small businesses doing something unique. Cinetics raised $480K with their Cineskates slider tripod and another $114K with their CineMoco project. You can get these at <url>’s got a few new tricks up its sleeve, and no, this isn’t an early April Fools joke! Twine 1.3 Spring brings a new update for your Twine. Here’s what’s included: - Twitter support. Now your Twine can tweet to your friends that the basement is flooding (or just @you that the laundry is done). - Support for Cloud Shield ( <url>— our original promise was "Connect your things to the Internet without a nerd degree." But you might have had an experience with sending text messages that didn't meet this promise. We relied on carriers to support their email gateways to send free SMS, but the fact that it's worked inconsistently for some people hasn't been acceptable. So we've invested time into rewriting this, and now Twine can send text messages to virtually any number, regardless of carrier or country. Unfortunately, each message costs us money, so we're making this a paid option for Twine to cover these costs. But this allows us to add some new features, too: all texts and calls will come from one number so you can save your Twine as a contact; and your Twine can optionally call you and speak notifications with the new phone call action. We're not taking away anything — the Twine account you have now will always be free, and as you read at the top of this email, continues to get new features. If the previous email-based SMS works for you, you can continue to use it through the email action. Learn more about the SMS/voice call upgrade — it's pay-as-you-go and you can cancel anytime. Try it, and if you aren't happy with it, we'll refund the cost of the account — just let us know within the first month. Please email us at <email> if you have any questions or feedback! -Christina <url>– As spring approaches (at least in the northern hemisphere), we hope your Twine is bringing reports of warmer temperatures! We’ve got an exciting new external sensor ready, and some some details about Twine’s battery life for you. Announcing the Twine Cloud Shield Stack Cloud Shield on your Arduino, connect it to Twine, and get email, texting, calling, and more in a jiffy. With Cloud Shield, you can add the ability to trigger any Twine output from your Arduino sketch with three lines of code, so you can focus on your idea and not debugging networking code. Want to see how easy it is? Want to see how many bananas (spoiler alert!) we can fit in a minute long video? Check out the video . What could make this even better? For a limited time only, if you get a Twine + Cloud Shield kit now, you’ll get $10 off! Already have a Twine, but want the Cloud Shield? Free shipping for you (domestic only)! In the video, you get a special sneak preview of a soon-to-be released notification method, phone calls! Your Twine will call you with the text you type in the action. It will be available as a paid option. Battery life update First of all, don't worry! We're not done reducing power consumption and are continuing to invest development resources into improving Twine battery life. The Twine 1.2 release not only added new features like vibration support, but also reduced the power used by the accelerometer and external port. Here's the situation at the moment: 1. In fixed installations, you can use virtually any micro-USB power supply to run your Twine. Here's one on Amazon with free shipping. Twine will automatically fall back to batteries if external power is lost. 2. This pie chart below shows how much power each Twine component uses. As you can see, the WiFi radio accounts for about 76% of Twine's power consumption. That's a big, but unfortunately very necessary chunk! To further improve battery life, we have started a major rework of the way that the radio subsystem works. This effort will take some time to complete, but should make very significant reductions in the amount of power that the radio uses. We'll keep you updated as we get closer to release. We've gotten to meet some of you at SXSW, and we're happy that we have all of you as backers — of Twine and of our passion for making our world smaller and friendlier through connected objects. Our team continues to work on making Twine better. As always, please email us directly at <email> if you're having any sort of trouble or haven't yet gotten your Twine reward, and we'll help figure it out. - The Supermechanics Hello Backers, We have good news and more good news for you. Shipping Update: The whole team worked hard (because we love our Kickstarter backers so much) to ship out all the Twines we had the information for in December, but we still have some lonely Twines to mail. If you haven’t gotten your Twine yet, we probably need you to confirm your shipping information or pay for international shipping. Check your account at <url>’t want everyone to see your personal information). Twine Update: It’s been a great week for Twine! It's been reading self-improvement books and now it's got some new features to show you. Here’s what’s included in the Twine 1.2 update: 1. Vibration sensor functionality. 2. Several small reductions in power consumption. 3. Celsius temperature readings, for all our international friends. 4. UI improvements, including Wi-Fi signal and battery life bars and an improved fast mode switch. To get the update, resave the rules on your Twine. For more information on what's new, check out our blog: Update 1.2 If you’re looking to expand your Twine’s repertoire, you can get 10’ cables and additional sensors in our store. Looking for ideas on how to use your Twine? Check out our how-tos , and mingle with the Twine community (Where all the cool kids are hanging out these days — you should be there too.) -Christina and the Supermechanics Hello backers, New Breakout Guide Time for a quick update. First of all, we've put together a guide on how to use the breakout board to connect all sorts of things to Twine. Check it out here: Using the Twine Breakout Board If you don't have a breakout yet, you're missing out---grab one at the link below: Get your Twine breakout board! International Shipping We also been making some good progress on the international shipping front. First, we fired our previous international shipping company, and moved all international shipping in house to keep a closer eye on it. As of today all international Twine only packages have been shipped. We have also shipped 80% of international Twine + magnetic switch packages, and the remaining 20% should be out tomorrow. We are currently processing 150-200 international packages per day and are chewing through our ~600 package backlog rapidly. Thank you for your patience as we plow through our remaining shipments. Have a problem? If you think that your Twine should have arrived, but it hasn't---drop us a note. Chances are that there was a problem with your shipping address, or some other small issue. We'll try to get you fixed up right away. Take care, David, John, and the Twine team. — Giving thanks for the last year; Kickstarter status; a bright new hardware partner; Black Friday sale Greetings, supporters and friends — A year ago today, we (David and John) launched the Kickstarter campaign for Twine. As it took off in the first days, the two of us were excitedly texting back and forth, in the midst of (barely) helping with household Thanksgiving preparations. Our expectations for the campaign were blown out of the water because of all of you, and for this, we're thankful. However, our expectations for Twine have always been high. Those of you who have gotten your Twine now understand the standard we hold our work to, and know that we aren't resting any time soon. Your Twine is an infant, and we're expanding its capabilities. Closing out the Kickstarter The Kickstarter is not quite over yet. We still have a couple hundred Twines to ship out to backers. We've begun shipping to international backers, and we expect to have everyone's Kickstarter Twines in the mail in the next two weeks. You don't have to email us asking for your status yet — you'll get an email when your Twine ships. (Thank you for being patient just a little longer.) And Twine continues to get smarter. We're finding and fixing the inevitable early bugs with your help. And we're building up support, documentation and how-tos for the community. Christina, our new customer support chief, aims to smooth out any bumps in your Twine experience, and has a bagful of Twine ideas to share. When you get your Twine, visit the forums and share your own ideas and how-tos. Listen to your world, control your lights with Twine+Spark <url>— the campaign is in progress, and this won't become reality without backers. We want to create awesome Twine+Spark applications, so show them some of the same generosity you've shown us. Black Friday sale We're proud that we were able to completely design and manufacture Twine in the USA, and as an American company, we of course have to participate in the grand tradition of Black Friday. This Friday, November 23rd only, you'll be able to buy any Twine kit from our online store for $10 off. And now that our shipping crunch is easing, we promise to have your order delivered by Christmas if you're in the US. (We'll also do our best to do the same for other countries, but no promises.) Thank you It's been an eventful year. Like any parents, the two of us have experienced the extremes of elation and stress. We've learned much about building Twine as a product, and Supermechanical as a business that can keep building products. Your understanding of the insane amount of work that we've had to do as a tiny hardware/software startup has been great — and as we now start to grow, we'll be able to do even more, at a sustainable pace. We've had several valuable contributors, but the greatest has been our first full-time employee, David Clift-Reaves, aka the production chief and shipmaster. As shipping settles down, he'll be able to turn his engineering talents to product development, as will we. We have lots in store! Our thoughts from a year ago came back to us when one of you sent us the photo at the top, of his Twine monitoring the temperature of a turkey thawing in the garage. This is awesome — you are awesome! We're working to make sure you continue to play a big part — Twine's community is a strength, and for this, we're thankful. — John and David, for the Supermechanical team Many of you have received an email saying your Twine has shipped, along with a tracking number. You may have also discovered that the tracking number you got is completely wrong! This is a major screw-up on the part of our shipper — we're not happy about it, and we've fixed it for the future. We don't have the correct tracking numbers for you, unfortunately. However, the packages are getting delivered to the correct addresses. We applied the address labels to your Twine boxes ourselves, and the first backers to get bad tracking numbers reported that their Twines showed up. We're very sorry for this. We know how cruel it is to finally get that email, and then be told that your own Twine is going to some other person. Rest assured that this is not the case, and you'll soon have an aqua-colored bundle of joy on your doorstep. — John Hi Backers, It's time again for an update! The last month has been super busy---we're been testing every single Twine and sensor, folding and packing boxes, and shipping things out the door. There's so much to do that we even have a bunch of new help, Christina, Quinn, Matt, and Chris!!! Here's the current status by the numbers: 1,029 Twines shipped so far and accelerating. This week will be our first to hit 1000 per week. 2,800 Twines delivered from our New Hampshire factory and tested (more arriving every week). 9,000 Sensors manufactured, testing more than halfway complete. 48,000 pieces of cardboard folded to form 6,000 Twine boxes. That's about 678,000 folds! Shipping status for US orders: David Clift-Reaves, our ship master, has been rocketing through our shipping backlog. By the end of this week almost all US Twine-only, Twine+sensor, and Twine+breakout orders will have been shipped. Time in transit is currently 7-10 business days. Twine full packages are also going out, but it will take a few more weeks to process the entire batch. Shipping status for international orders: Shipping internationally in large quantity has been an adventure. We've gotten Twine CE approved and certified by wireless regulatory agencies in a variety of countries. We have to do all of this certification because otherwise customs might confiscate our packages. (Eek!) The last major hurdle is doing international address verification to make sure that we have all of the addresses in the proper format so that packages don't get lost or mis-delivered. The first small batch of Twine-only units has gone out, and David has been hard at work to accelerate us up to full speed. We anticipate hitting full throttle by the end of next week. New Developments The engineering department hasn't been asleep either. Today we launched version 1.1 of the Twine software which allows Twine to recognize external sensors, improves the setup process, reduces power consumption, and fixes a number of bugs that we've encountered so far. If you'd like to check it out, just re-save your Twine rules and you will be automatically updated. Take care, David, John, David, Christina, Matt, Quinn, and Chris Today we hit a huge milestone in the history of Twine—-we started shipping! More on the blog: <url>— read more at our blog . Designing an object for mass production is just as painstaking and amazing as any traditional artisanal process. It's a great feeling to make something that meets your vision and is produceable at scale, and we've hit that milestone with Twine's case, and pending a final assembly check, the electronics. Our hand is hovering over the button for full production — 500,000 parts coming together to make all the Twines! Read about it at the blog: <url>— all at the blog . Since our last update we’ve really gotten into a productive groove here in Austin. Maybe it’s the sunshine, maybe it’s the much cheaper beer — whatever it is, it’s really been working. Status report on all fronts at our blog: <url>— the schedule for the final stretch, a tour of the assembly process in New Hampshire, and lots of photos. Read it at the blog: <url>— it’s been a while. We’ve been working as hard as ever, but refactoring C functions and moving lines by .005” do not lend themselves to blog posts. We've now got a pile of things to share with you — literally. Read the whole update at our blog. (We also randomly post tidbits on Facebook and Twitter if you'd like more Supermechanical in your diet.) We also have some important homework for backers: the Spool site has been updated with your shipping address — please check that it's correct and make any changes there. Many of you haven’t yet signed up — if you didn’t get the registration email (check your spam folder), let us know at <email> with the email address you used for Kickstarter, and we’ll resend your registration link. Hi Backers, We've got a *huge* new update for your over at the Supermechanical blog. Grab a beverage, and have a gander! A nice big and juicy Twine update is now up on the Supermechanical blog: <url>"The kids have watched enough TV today." WHEN Bedside Lamp is turned off THEN tweet "Goodnight, John-Boy." Hello, friends and backers — as you can imagine, we've been very busy since our Kickstarter ended. Forgive us if we don't answer messages right away; we're clearing away the backlog. We finally had time to count the votes for the second additional external sensor (which we'll develop for sale after Twine has shipped), and the current sensor won with 45% of the votes. This sensor snaps over the power cable of your AC devices and measures power consumption from 0-50 amps, or whether a device is on or off. It will be priced at $45. If your choice didn't get picked, we'll soon have one more sensor vote. Second place was again the external high-temperature sensor, so that will get another chance. We'll have a big update next week! Until then, have a good weekend. John and David Hi Backers, We're starting to test Twine with lots of different brands and models of wireless access points. Would you please help us out by telling us what kind of access point you have? Please tell us what router you have here: <url>— you guys are amazing . When we started this 6 weeks ago, our expectations were modest, other than making a product that we wanted and that others would find useful, too. John and I cannot believe that you pushed Twine past 550K, making it one of the most successful crowd-funded projects ever! We are going to take good care of you. Twine will be that much more polished and ready to rock because of your support. Missed the Kickstarter? Not to worry. You can still join the thousands of other awesome Twine owners by pre-ordering at the Supermechanical site. It's the next best thing to being an original backer! It's time for us to hunker down and start cranking out Twines now. We'll keep you up to speed on our progress with updates every week or so. Until then, have a fantastic 2012! David Carr and John Kestner Friends, This crazy Kickstarter ride is almost over, and Twine is nearing $500,000 in funding. It sounds incredible to our ears, but our thousands of incredible backers have made it possible! Help us surpass that big round number by Tuesday — support or share the project one more time... here's a video to help if you need more ideas: <url>"Not a creature was stirring." WHEN motion sensor detects motion, THEN tweet "Someone's peeking at gifts under the tree!" Our backers have spoken, and the first additional external sensor (which we'll develop for sale after Twine has shipped) has been selected. The IR motion sensor took it in a landslide with over half the votes! This sensor senses movement from up to 5 meters away and has a 90º field of view. It will cost $40. If your choice didn't get picked, don't fret. Second place was the external high-temperature sensor, and that will get another chance in our second sensor poll next week. And between us and your more tech-savvy Twine fellows, there will be how-tos on building other sensors. Happy holidays, John and David So we've been cranking away on all fronts - hardware, software, and all the little things you have to do between. We've continued to have a flood of enthusiasm filling up our inbox, so forgive us if we're sometimes slow to respond. Those of you who requested gift cards can also look forward to something filling your mailbox: Our wonderful, wonderful backers have been busy, too, pushing us within spitting distance of 1000% funding! (Apparently, it doesn't hurt to be featured in Kickstarter's newsletter, either - thank you very much, compatriots.) Some of the great press we've received recently: <url>’t on the list send us a message and we’ll add it to the pool. We’ll cherry pick the best ones and offer them up for a vote in next week’s update. We’re excited already. A little note: Thanks to your fantastic support, your Twine is going to be able to connect to a lot more stuff. Good thing that we set a limit at three sensors, otherwise we’d have to make about 30 at the way things are going! In order to get everyone’s Twines and stock sensors out as soon as possible, we’re going to focus on those initially. Once those are all out the door, we’ll start taking orders for the new ones. Stay tuned. Thanks again — you’ve allowed us to kick this product to a higher gear. And keep talking about Twine! The more funds we raise, the more we can make your Twine do. We love you, David and John
