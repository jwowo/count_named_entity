Welcome and thanks for checking out our project! The WALdok is a small form-factor speaker/charger dock for iDevices that plugs DIRECTLY into any standard wall outlet. The WALdok allows you to plug-n-play and plug-n-charge in the bathroom, kitchen, office, or anywhere there is a wall outlet. It takes complete advantage of modularity. Go from jogging with ear buds to filling the bathroom with same music in an instant! MAIN FEATURES: * Wall plug-in cordless charger dock compatible with most Apple iDevices * High quality speaker that plugs directly into standard wall sockets * Bass chamber that reverberates and simulates a sub-woofer * Internal battery to it can also be used as a desk top speaker (we're shooting for 8 hours playback!) * Flip out retractable plugs for sleeker portability * Compatible with interchangeable international plug adapters for UK, EU and AU (these will be sold separately at WALdok.com - see animation at bottom of the page) The ORIGINAL idea for the WALdok came from using the iPod primarily on-the-go, then not having an easy way to continue the music without ear buds. Although we have many devices to play music, there were also a lot of times when we didn't want to fiddle with stereo systems or boot up computers (e.g. coming home after a run, waking up in the morning, flossing before bedtime, or just preparing a meal in the kitchen). Especially after working out, we wanted to conveniently unclip the iPod, just plug-n-play, and hit the shower. And while we're at it, it's automatically charging for the next workout! Of course, there are many portable speakers and docks out there - the speaker docks are mostly large and cumbersome, portable speakers were designed mostly for traveling, and they all took up precious desk and sink counter space. We also didn't like the idea of having any electronics on the wet sink, especially with unsightly cords snaking up to the outlet. Other disappointments were poor "tinny" sound quality and the lack of charging feature on portable speakers (which are mostly designed for any generic MP3 player). Design wise, we wanted to develop a product that was: portable and small in form-factor, convenient yet out of the way (no cords!), while not compromising on sound quality. Early form inspirations were wall plug-in nightlights and scented oil warming devices. Another important consideration was to complement both the minimalist Apple design, WHILE addressing the round form-factor of the large speaker driver. But don't let the small size fool you! - we have designed the WALdok to produce the biggest and best sound possible. Besides the small form-factor, we wanted the sound quality to be a top priority. After reviewing other portable speakers, we made the decision early on to go with a LARGE 40mm driver and not compromise for anything less. The sound quality difference in the 40mm driver was surprising in terms of the precise highs and clarity it produced, as well as volume in general. We also specifically designed a spacious "bass chamber" inside the body to reverberate the output sound like a sub-woofer, thus producing a fuller, richer low-end response. The result is a crisp and booming sound in a compact package.. You can even take it while traveling! For travel compactness, we incorporated the retractable flip-out plug feature. Why bring both portable speakers and a charger cord? Even if you have a full sized dock and speakers at home, the WALdok is the easiest way to plug-n-play for ambient music. KICKSTARTERS! This is where we need your support. We have so far designed and developed the FIRST proof-of-concept prototype. It looks, works, and sounds awesome. It fills the entire bathroom with music while showering. It even makes us brush and floss our teeth longer! What makes our project much more costly (than typical add-on products) is definitely the electronics - We're not just making a charging dock, we're making a high quality speaker as well. This is a significant added cost besides the tooling to make plastic parts, purchasing all components, design and development of packaging, and logistics/fulfillment. Also with your support, you are being a part of developing a cool new product from sketch to production! As a gift, you'll receive the first units fresh off the lines. Also, you'll gain private access to the development process as we'll be chronicling with details, insights, hurdles and issues that often arise in product development. In the higher backer levels, we'll run limited editions of the WALdok in BLACK, as well as offer our one-of-a-kind transparent body BETA level prototypes Interchangeable adapters for international outlets (UK, EU, AU) which will be sold separately on WALdok.com. *** iPhone4 *** *** iPod classic *** *** iPod touch *** *** iPod nano 6th Gen *** *** iPod nano 5th Gen *** Thanks for your support! Note: The first prototype we made is shown in the photos - the final product color & finish will be much sexier! Speaker driver cap may be red or chrome - depending on our final component sourcing.
