Throughout my life, I have been curious about geometric forms and folds. During my time at MIT, I was introduced to more elaborate forms of origami, and a language for analysing and generating those 3-dimensional shapes. As a child who always invented paper toys and dolls, it was my dream to transform them into something beautiful that I could have at home. Thus, bloom was born. The bloom blankets will come in two colours, white and grey. A customised version of bloom could have any pattern of colours and varying sizes of tetrahedrons. The care and keeping of bloom : It is best to spot clean or dry clean the bloom blanket, but it can also be hand-washed in cold water and laid flat to dry. The approximate dimensions of bloom are 110cm by 160cm, or 43in by 63in. I used Processing, an open source programming language, to make models of bloom, and experiment with different geometries.
