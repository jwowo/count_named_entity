Let me start by quoting my homie RA the Rugged Man, “Every record label sucks d**k.” I got fucked where I was at. My debut album was poorly promoted at best, had little to no in house support from the label and on top of that, they took a large chunk of the profit being generated while simultaneously using shady, creative accounting to withhold as much of my cut as possible. As I’m sure a portion of you are aware, it got a little ugly with the label but I was successful in being released from my deal, allowing me to go out on my own and broaden my horizons. Alien Manuscript Tee Alien Manuscript Hoodie I had a few reputable labels try to sign me after my release. These labels offered me sucker deals. They wanted to take a huge percentage of what I generate while spending as little as possible. To make it worse, they wanted half my tour money, half my merch money and half my publishing, locking me into 5-10 album contracts at slave wages. They demanded they own my masters forever and to top it all off they wanted to take creative control away from me, watering down my music. I couldn’t allow that. Not only for myself but for the fans who enabled me to even be in the position to negotiate the situation. I NEED my creative freedom so I can give my people what they deserve. I want Fightin Words to garner the attention and notoriety I feel was lacking with Liar and a Thief and I believe that I am fully capable of making that happen. I learned from past experience and won’t make the same mistakes as the people I trusted with my future. Let’s get something straight though, I’m not some charity case. I had my reservations about doing a Kickstarter for obvious reasons. My ego is saying “you can’t do that, what are people gonna think of you? You’ll look like a bum.” Luckily for me, I have no problem being real with myself and my supporters. So let’s be real, between lawyers to get out of my deal, raising kids and getting fucked by a label, I’m broke as fuck. I’m living check to check so to speak, gig to gig, payday to payday and to be honest I’m tired of it. My supporters deserve a better version of me. So I asked myself, how do I give them this better version of me? The answer is to let my supporters be my label. I let my supporters be my boss. I give them the opportunity to get behind what they want, providing me with the funding I need to record music videos, publicize the project and tour the world, in the process, I have the chance to give them some cool shit as an incentive to do so. So here we are, just us. That “dying breed” of real hip hop heads ready to smack these overrated, silly, wack rappers off their pedestals. Let’s get it, FUCK what everyone else thinks!
