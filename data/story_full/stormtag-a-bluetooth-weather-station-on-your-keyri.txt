Our Kickstarter Campaign is Over! Pre-Order StormTag Here. StormTag is the best Bluetooth Weather Station for Android & iOS. Our Kickstarter campaign is over, but you can still get a StormTag. Head over to www.stormtag.co for more info and to place an order. Thanks to our wonderful backers, StormTag will begin shipping in November 2014. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- What if you could be part of a team that changed the way our climate was analysed? We’re plan to perfect crowd sourced weather forecasts, and we need your commitment to help us. And, wouldn’t it be great to carry a weather station on your keyring? Now you can. Not only do you get the best Bluetooth Weather Station for yourself, but your StormTag will contribute meaningful data that is open for scientific analysis. StormTag - waterproof bluetooth weather station StormTag Shares Weather Data to the Cloud Stormtag is set to revolutionise weather data collection, and as our App collects that data we’ll begin to provide you with some weather predictions in real time, even without an internet connection. Basic StormTag Features Barometric Pressure Sensor for weather mapping Temperature sensor 100% waterproof Over 1 year battery life! StormTag+ Features: Barometric Pressure Sensor for weather mapping Temperature sensor Data logging for as long as the battery lasts. Weather data is stored in onboard memory even when your phone or tablet is not connected to StormTag+. More regular syncing will deliver finer grained data. Humidity Sensor: to provide more accurate forecasting and more complete data collection. UV sensor: For skin safety - log your time in the sun. StormTag+ will now know if it is outside and provide even more valuable data. 100% waterproof Over 1 year battery life! Everyone would like to know about local weather. Now You Will! StormTag CR2032 Battery and Size Comparison StormTag will help everybody who has an interest in the weather and climate. It’s water resistant design can attach to your ski jacket, backpack, keyring, boat keys. WeatherSignal App with StormTag Bluetooth Weather Station How does StormTag work and what does it do? StormTag has a temperature and a barometric pressure sensor, it uses Bluetooth LE to communicate this data to iPhones, iPads and compatible Android devices. Weather Map - StormTag collects data worldwide and builds weather maps Imbalances in air pressure cause wind and weather. You’ve seen weather maps on the evening news, those lines on a weather map join together places with the same surface pressure. The shape of the isobars describes the weather pattern, so changes in the weather can be forecast by tracking the changing isobar pattern or by observing pressure change. The tighter the pattern, the stronger the winds. As these patterns move over us the wind direction, precipitation and weather conditions change. For example, a sustained DROP in pressure is a sign of more chance of rain, while a sustained RISE in pressure is a sign of less chance of rain. Of course, since you have a computer in your pocket you won’t need to worry about this, because the WeatherSignal App will monitor and interpret all of the pressure and temperature signals StormTag provides, it can send you alerts for sudden changes. The barometric sensor measures air pressure, this varies with altitude, but we can compensate for this using map and GPS data. StormTag Provides Weather Data - Everywhere - Even With No Internet As you can see in the video above, WeatherSignal already works with the limited number of Android devices that have inbuilt barometric and temperature sensors. StormTag will work with all iOS and Android devices that have Bluetooth LE. For a relatively small outlay, you get a personal weather station! You also contribute all this anonymous data back to our cloud of weather information where it can be accessed by scientists and all other StormTag owners. Inside StormTag - Prototype PCB and battery Please help us build crowdsourced weather forecasts. StormTag is the best Bluetooth Weather Station available I’m using similar electronics found in our YuFu pressure sensitive stylus - the best fine point stylus for iPads, switching out the gyro for the barometer and the compass for the thermometer. Our YuFu electronics are already in production, so this is going to save us a lot of time. It’s also why I can do this with such a low target - we just need to fund the plastic tooling costs. With your help we can bring StormTag to market and improve localised weather predictions. Thanks!
