HAPPY DAY! *****We've reached our initial goal of $25,000 which means everyone who pledges at the $35 level or higher receives DOUBLE the number of listed limited edition signed and numbered hardcover copies of the Quantum Roleplaying Game! So right now if you pledge $42 for U.S. addresses or $47 for International addresses (which now includes shipping) you will receive TWO COPIES of the game! What a deal!***** HAPPY DAY AGAIN! *****We've reached our final goal of $36,000 which means (1) one 24" x 36" full color folded poster world map of Quantum will be shipped with every single pledge order $35 and above. While there will be a map of the world inside the Quantum RPG hardcover, it will be a black & white map and obviously won't be bigger than a single page. This 24" x 36" poster world map will not only give you the world in amazing full color, but it will be large enough to include a wide variety of extra map tags to add both a little mystery to the world and ensuring that all locations generated during design show up on the poster map.***** ABOUT THIS PROJECT The Quantum Roleplaying Game™ is Infinite X Studio™'s first game. The game is a reflection of more than 30 years of RPG gaming and nearly 10 years of writing and game design on the part of Infinite X Studio's founder and President, Joshua J. Frost. Josh's passion for gaming and RPGs in particular is hard to explain in words (and much easier to explain by watching his hyper exuberance during a game session) but know that he wants Infinite X Studio to produce only the highest quality, best-designed, and most enjoyable RPGs possible. It is our dream that we can reach out to both seasoned and new gamers with this project and help us raise enough money to bring the Quantum Roleplaying Game to hundreds of game tables around the globe. Our Kickstarter goal is only set at $13,000 and this covers the barest minimum of costs to write, design, layout, produce art, edit, develop, print, and ship the game. The total funding goal is comprised of 10% Kickstarter fees and Amazon fees, 50% artist, layout, design, editing, and development costs, 10% promotional costs, and 30% printing costs. Should we raise money beyond the $13,000 target, several things will happen: At $15,000, we give most of the freelancers a nice raise (Infinite X Studio President Joshua Frost doesn't get paid at all unless the game is a success). *****GOAL ACHIEVED!***** At $25,000, we double the number of limited, signed and numbered hardcover copies of the Quantum Roleplaying Game that are sent out to the backers at the $35 Journeyman level or higher. So if you back the QRPG project at $35 and the project raises $25,000 or more, you receive two copies instead of one. This will not increase any associated shipping costs, even for non-U.S.A. addresses. Also at $25,000, we're able to print a small quantity of regular edition hardcover books that we plan to sell into hobby distribution so the game can be available at hobby stores in the United States and beyond. *****GOAL ACHIEVED!***** At $36,000, we will ship (1) one 24" x 36" full color folded poster world map of Quantum with every single pledge $35 and above. While there will be a map of the world inside the Quantum RPG hardcover, it will be a black & white map and obviously won't be bigger than a single page. This 24" x 36" poster world map will not only give you the world in amazing full color, but it will be large enough to include a wide variety of extra map tags to add both a little mystery to the world and ensuring that all locations generated during design show up on the poster map. ABOUT THE GAME An innovative, highly-technological society in Earth's distant future built a robotic Dyson Shell world where science was king, where reason was law, and where all the complexities of day-to-day living were made easy by a level of gadgets that would make modern humanity believe they were witnessing the true works of gods. Their cutting-edge world expanded rapidly and disconnected from the rest of humanity, rocketed out to the edge of the universe, and hurtled into the very fabric of space-time in order to discover new sources of untapped power to expand their knowledge of the universe itself. Then it happened: they found an energy source so powerful they were convinced it had to be the very glue that held the universe together. They tapped it deep, plunging into the distant beating heart of this new spark, causing their robotic world to nearly burst with inscrutable power. Feats of unimaginable prowess were discovered, manifesting objects and energy with only one's thoughts became a reality—even the control over life and death became as trivial as breathing. What they didn't know—couldn't know—was that their newly discovered source came with a dreadful price. At its heart was darkness, vast unfathomable evil from beyond the edge of reason and space-time—shadowy, slithering horrors of such sinister potency that they infested the entire society from the inside out and not only tore it to pieces, but nearly sundered the world, sending every living thing spinning into a shattered, morose millennium of bedlam and anarchy. It's been 1,000 years since the fall of the great society known as Quantum and the civilized species of the world are finally rediscovering a semblance of what they lost. Quantum is a Dyson shell, an inside-out planet roughly the size of Mars but with a sun-like ball of fiery plasma at the center, providing both heat and light to the flora and fauna around it. Though civilization is clambering from the ruins, it still has a long way to go before achieving the greatness of the Time Before. Today's Quantum civilization is equivalent to medieval Earth with castles, walled towns, large farming communities, kings, queens, serfdom, chivalry, open warfare, political intrigue, and vast swaths of uncontrolled territory. Ancient experiments in reanimating extinct creatures from their DNA, animal and human cloning, whole-cloth invention of beasts both great and terrible, and self-replicating artificial intelligences have left the wild places of Quantum filled with terrifying monstrosities from myth, legend, and earth's extensive fossil record as well as new races of living machines and swarms of metallic insects. Quantum is broken into twelve nations, some with loose associations, some with iron clad pacts, and some engaged in open war. At the heart of these nations is an organization called The Progenancy. They control all that remains of Quantum's lost technological knowledge, wielding their control of it in order to maintain as much of a peace as possible. The Progenancy is not a good nor charitable organization, though. They exact a terrible price from those who refuse to acknowledge their mastery of the world, going so far as to cut off one nation from every power source Quantum possesses, plunging those people into an eternal darkness from which no one has returned. Opposing the Progenancy is a loose affiliation of shamanistic tribal societies and underground resistance movements from the remaining eleven nations. This affiliation does all that it can to sabotage the Progenancy's control of technology, but it is a war they are losing very badly. In the Quantum Roleplaying Game, you can choose to play one of four races: Humans Humanity is more than half the population of the civilized races of Quantum and controls nearly all of the nations. Most of the Progenancy is human and they are often associated with power and greed in the eyes of the other races. Humanity spreads quickly, decisively, and has an uncanny knack for resiliency in the face of adversity. Azi The azi are a race of snake people, human in appearance from the waist up, but possessing all of the qualities of a snake from the waist down. Azi are humanoid reptiles—they have no hair, hatch their young from eggs, and their genders are quite difficult to determine by non-azi. Azi are comprised of dozens of sub-species that vary by color, shape, and size and their skin is scaled, soft, and very often comprised of mesmerizing color patterns. Mutants Mutants are the offspring of humans who ventured too closely to the source of Quantum's power (called Prime). As such, they are often called Primespawn. Mutants come in a variety of shapes and sizes and their mutations range from the useful to the patently grotesque. When two mutants pair and have children, their children are always mutants, though they rarely possess the same mutations as their parents. Mutants are reviled in both human and azi cultures and those who choose to stay are often cast out to the fringes, scraping by as criminals or beggars. Those who flee bond together as tribes and wander the wild places of Quantum, avoiding human and azi cities. Automatons Automatons are genderless, hyper-intelligent, living machines. They are a remnant of the Time Before—a remnant even the Progenancy doesn't understand. Automatons awaken in hidden-away places possessing the reasoning capacity of a 15-year-old human and a wide-eyed obsession with learning everything about the world around them. Automatons have no single society and typically wander into whatever civilization is nearby where they are often accepted and put to work. Automatons are weak structurally and no single automaton has lived longer than 40 years, but during their time on Quantum they are relentless in their pursuit of scholarship and wisdom. The first choice you make in the Quantum Roleplaying Game is your race—the second is your “paradigm.” Paradigms are the worldview of your character, not only how they perceive everything around them, but also what path they choose to follow in life. Quantum has 17 paradigms, 16 of which are rather specific in their focus and one called the Generalist that is more customizable to suit the unique desires of any player. Example paradigms include Archer, Warrior, Warlock, Progenitor, Shaman, Immortal, Reaver, Hunter, and Crusader. The rest will be revealed once play-testing of the Quantum Roleplaying Game begins! THE INFINITE ROLEPLAYING ENGINE The Quantum Roleplaying Game is powered by the Infinite Roleplaying Engine™, a customizable game system built on a strong mathematical foundation from which nearly any genre of RPG can be created. The game uses the same polyhedral dice that many of you are probably used to (d20, d12, d10, etc.) but dice-rolling facilitates two primary objectives: it rewards knowledge and advancement by decreasing the chance of failure as the level of skill increases and it allows for a more open system between the players and the Guide (also called the game master) so that both parties can easily work together to create a cinematic storyline filled with intrigue, conflict, combat, death, warfare, and triumph and do so without bogging down in complicated dice checks and endless rolling. The Infinite Roleplaying Engine is exactly that: a “role”-playing engine. The dice, though used and needed, are secondary to the experience of playing. A FEW WORDS ON GENDER EQUALITY It is the promise of Infinite X Studio that we will always strive to present a world that in many ways reflects what our world should be. Specifically, the stereotypical portrayals of women in RPGs as either barely-clothed, subservient slaves or obnoxiously under-dressed warrior queens have no place in any of our product lines. Civilizations in our games will rarely explore gender differences unless that exploration is central to the story or theme of a location. We assume, as we believe everyone should on Earth, that there is no difference between men and women other than some basic biological designs and we strongly believe that hobby gaming is for everyone regardless of gender, age, skin color, sexual preference or identity, or religious belief (including a lack thereof). We want our products and our art to reflect this promise and hope that our community of friends will keep us honest should we ever seem to stray from it. WHO IS INFINITE X STUDIO? Joshua J. Frost, President Josh started writing in junior high school, majored in Creative Writing and Publishing in college, and started working in the hobby games industry in 2005. He has 38 writing and design credits for roleplaying games, co-designed one card game with Mike Selinker (Yetisburg), and designed a game for the board game Stonehenge called “Any Given Run Play” that appeared in the October 2007 issue of Games Magazine. He designed and wrote games and game supplements for Dungeons & Dragons 3.5, Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition, the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, and A Song of Ice and Fire Roleplaying Game and was nominated for two Origins Awards and won six ENnie Awards for fantasy RPG writing and design. Josh lives in a Seattle suburb with his wife, daughter, cat, dog, and iMac. Hugo Solis, Artist & Cartographer Hugo Solis, also known as Butterfrog, found his love of RPGs in 1990 when he miraculously stumbled upon the Dark Sun boxed set at his local game store—no mean feat in a comic shop in México. Hugo resides in Guadalajara, Mexico with his patient wife (who is his toughest art critic) and their two Schnauzers. Hugo began illustrating character artwork for Pathfinder fans on the paizo.com messageboards in 2008. Shortly thereafter, he co-created the award winning Wayfinder fanzine with Liz Courts as a way to bring the Paizo fan community to a whole new level. Hugo now does freelance illustration and cartography for many companies including 4 Winds Fantasy, Legendary Games, Paizo Publishing, Open Design, Rite Publishing, and SKR Games among others. Blake Davis, Developer Blake Davis is a passionate table-top gamer and has worked in several aspects of the gaming industry. Besides running various RPGs for over 9 years, including D&D and the Pathfinder RPG, Blake is the mastermind behind Archives of Nethys (www.archivesofnethys.com), an extensive reference guide for the Pathfinder RPG. He has a degree in Integrated Studies and an uncanny knack for memorizing rules and spotting rules issues and flaws. Reid Schmadeka, Editor Reid Schmadeka has worked in the gaming industry for more than a dozen years, starting with White Wolf Publishing as an editor and then Wizards of the Coast as a contributor and editor for the Wizards Play Network website. He was the author of Transylvania Chronicles III: Ill Omens and a contributor to Castles and Covenants, both for White Wolf. His story "Faces" was published in the Satiated Sunrise Word Speak Network anthology, and his stories "The Barn" and "Avarice" in the magazine Line Zero. He currently lives in Seattle with his wife, son, and daughter. Colleen Hutchings, Graphic Design/Layout Colleen Hutchings' whereabouts have been a secret for more than 400 years. It is whispered in conspiracy circles that it was she who founded the Illuminati and that any conspiracy theories about who runs the world are complete fabrications invented by Hutchings as an effort to throw everyone off the truth. It is known that she acquired a Bachelor's Degree in Graphic Design from Saint Mary-of-the-Woods sometime in the last decade, but even finding out that much cost us 13 interns. Kyle Hepworth, Art & Design Kyle Hepworth is a rogue Seattle artist responsible for dozens of random acts of art. He once decorated his neighbor's broken down truck as M. Truckington III complete with a windshield monocle, a bumper mustache, and an enormous top hat. In his spare time he creates miniature piñatas and Super Mario Brothers coins and hangs them in places for people to destroy and/or jump up and try to get 100 of them. Beyond that, Hepworth's life is a mystery known only to him, Joshua Frost, and 43,567 of their closest friends.
