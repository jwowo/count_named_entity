I want to thank each and every one of you backers for believing in this project. This Kickstarter campaign was amazing! If you're finding this after the Kickstarter ends, head on over to: <url>"Mac In Cloud". I'll show you exactly how to set it up on your PC! The Course This video course is the exact resource that I wish I had available when I first started. I spent so much time (over 4 months) just trying to find the right resource to start learning from. This course will save you all of that time searching so you can focus on what's important - actually learning! The course will all be available online or offline as a download. The course is split into three sections. In each one, you will build an entire app from scratch while learning the concepts behind them. Challenges along the way will make sure you understand what you're learning! Section #1 (Included in $25 & $49 rewards) ~~~ Introduction to Programming & Objective-C ~~~ I'll start off by giving you an introduction to programming and Objective-C (the programming language used to code iPhone apps). We'll use a lot of neat examples and analogies, so I'll be sure to make everything very clear and easy to understand. There will be a few challenges along the way for you to make sure you understand what you're learning. I'll go through each challenge's solution thoroughly. ~~~ Build Your First App ~~~ After that, you'll learn how to make your first iPhone app! I'll guide you through the process as you build a fun little app that you can immediately show off to your friends or family. *** BONUS *** As a bonus in Section 1, I'll include videos on these topics: How to Find a Great App Idea How to Validate Your App Idea Section #2 (Included in $49 reward) ~~~ Intermediate Topics & Your Second App ~~~ In Section #2 we'll dive into some deeper topics to extend your knowledge of iOS development. You'll still be building a complete app as we go along, so you'll get to see exactly what you're learning come to life! In addition, we'll begin to bring in some open-source libraries and I'll show you how to effectively use them in your apps. *** BONUS *** As a bonus in Section 2, I'll include videos on these topics: Why Use Open Source? Best Practices For Designing Apps The Best Tools For App Design How iOS 7 Has Changed The Game [And Many More!] Section #3 (Included in $49 reward) ~~~ Advanced Topics & Your Third App ~~~ In the final section, we'll go through building a more advanced application that will use a backend (everything that goes on behind the scenes) service called Parse. Parse is a really great service that is becoming massively popular. People with backend skills are highly sought after - I've even gotten a few job offers because I have backend coding experience. In addition, we'll dive deep into the possibilities of iOS development and the different opportunities available now that you have these skills. *** BONUS *** As a bonus in Section 3, I'll include videos on these topics: Opportunities In iOS Development What is Freelancing & Getting Your First Clients Finding A Profitable App Niche Getting a Full-Time Job as an iOS Developer [And Many More!] New Packages!

I develop apps professionally over at my consulting company, Beckbits, am the author of The iOS 7 App Design Guide, and run a blog over at taylorbeck.me where I talk about apps. I am creating this course because it is the exact resource I wish I had when I first started - fun, entertaining, and informative video tutorials; insightful challenges to make sure you understand the material; and actually building real apps while learning to see your newfound skills come to life.
