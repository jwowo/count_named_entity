The Next Big Thing is a great friends and family board game to help inspire the founders of the next big thing! “The Next Big Thing: The Game of Entrepreneurship” is a board game where players take on the role of startup founders to launch “the next big thing” that will change the world and eventually make them millions or potentially billions of dollars. Players start by bootstrapping their companies using initial cash savings and “superpower” skills such as programming or marketing to create a minimal viable product. They then grow their team, get their first customers, and move into an office. Players will experience many of the ups and downs of entrepreneurship with multiple significant events (good and bad) that happen along the way and take different paths such as an accelerator or a detour with a pivot path. As players grow their companies, they raise multiple rounds of capital from investors, increasing their company’s valuation, while watching their founder’s equity get diluted. At the end of the game, players must strategize and decide the best path to “cash out” for the most amount of money by choosing either to get acquired or to do an IPO. The player with the highest final Founder's Value wins! #1 Board Game For Entrepreneurship & Venture Capital The board game has received wide support from the venture capital and entrepreneur community, with top accelerators, crowdfunding platforms, and venture funds included on the game box and in the game rules to help educate players of actual investors, including 500 Startups, Plug & Play, Y Combinator, Crowdfunder, SeedInvest, HBS Angels, New York Angels, Sand Hill Angels, SV Angel, Cowboy Ventures, SoftTech, ff Venture Capital, Founder Collective, RRE, FirstMark Capital, Tomorrow Ventures, Greycroft Venture Partners, Upfront Ventures, NEA, Battery Ventures, Norwest, Kleiner Perkins, Intel Capital, and Comcast Ventures. The Next Big Thing was created by a husband (venture capitalist) and wife (serial entrepreneur) who love to play board games and wanted to inspire future entrepreneurs. One day when they were looking for a board game to play, they saw their two favorite games on the self, The Game of Life and Monopoly. They thought, "why can't there be a board game about Entrepreneurship that could exist in everyone's home just like these two classics?" Like every good Venture Capitalist and Entrepreneur they researched the market and found that there was a white space that they could fill. They created a prototype and then shared it with their friends, many of whom were fellow VCs and entrepreneurs, to have them play and get their feedback. The first players loved it, and after iterating, it has gotten better and better with each group that played. Based on the excitement of the players the creators of the board game knew they were really onto something! They can't wait to release the first version of the game to the public soon. “This game let’s you go through the roller coaster journey of being an entrepreneur, from beginning to end. You can experience all of this from the safety of a 45 minute to 2 hour board game that you can play with your friends and family. ‘The Next Big Thing’ is a lot of fun and a great way to learn about entrepreneurship and venture capital.” explains co-creator, Jenna Dreher Fernandes.
