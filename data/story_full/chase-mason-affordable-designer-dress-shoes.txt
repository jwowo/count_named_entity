BIO Currently working for high end exotic car brand, where I've learned about Italian design and passion. Holding high expectations and knowing the little details make all the difference. Want to share what I learned and make it obtainable through design. The dress shoes I would see everyday to me seemed boring and when I started working at a high end exotic car dealer everything changed. The dress shoes you would see were high fashion and I wanted to create it without paying designer dollars for them. Hand Made Construction using Genuine Leather with Polyurethane Insole for Comfort.
