WHAT IS vrAse? vrAse is the biggest revolution your Smartphone has ever seen; a very special case, which enables you to use it like never imagined before. Today Smartphones have everything we need to enjoy movies and games in a portable way. The BIG issue is they have small screens to do so, and your hands are kept busy holding them. We have created vrAse to solve these two problems. With vrAse you can enjoy movies in a huge 3D-Perfect screen, play totally immersive games and experience the awesome possibilities of Augmented Reality… everything in a super compact, portable, affordable, hands free use and upgradable device. You have to try vrAse, to see what you have been missing all this time! The screen is so BIG, 3D contents are so perfect and vivid, and everything is done in such a simple and convenient way, that we really believe we have developed something special. Forget TV, consoles and expensive gadgets that have wires and low resolution screens… with vrAse you can take your Smartphone to the next dimension, and have fun from day one. WHAT THEY SAY "vrAse Is A Wearable Smartphone Case That Makes Your Face A Virtual Reality Play-Zone" - Natasha Lomas, TechCrunch “…it delivers a compelling 3D effect – as expected crosstalk and ghosting is absent and depth was very good”.

HOW TO USE IT Download any content which is “Side by Side” (SBS) ready to your smartphone and you are set. The Smartphone is a machine built for communications, so you can also stream the contents and games from various devices, such as the PC, MAC and TV.

GAMING vrAse put games where they are destined to be; your Smartphone. Mobiles phones today are very powerful and will continue to improve in the future; they will get better screens, processors, cameras, sensors, etc. Any game programed for your Smartphone is really easy to convert for vrAse. You can download or stream any existing game available; the ones that are already made for 3D in Side by Side format (SBS) or convert any game to SBS using the driver of your choice. AUGMENTED REALITY Augmented Reality is such a hopeful area that we wanted to design a gadget which finally would allow people to start playing with it without using their hand, and be amazed by its possibilities. Your Smartphone has a powerful frontal camera, so it´s a perfect match for vrAse capabilities. Also, as it´s a really affordable device, you´ll be compelled to start experimenting it, without any regret. In applications that will become a huge benefit in sectors such as educational and professional ones. PLACES WHERE YOU CAN USE vrAse vrAse MODELS Here are the names of our two designs.

(Hint: exclusive content) DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS You can code in any of your favorite coding platforms for your Smartphone. We already are contacting developers and also platforms, to run any software you want in vrAse. Coding for vrAse is exactly the same as coding for a smartphone, which allows developers to reach infinite possibilities because it is really easy. And if you are a developer we are sure you will love to code for the platform which already is in hands of more than 1.100 million customers, a number growing about 10% every year. As vrAse opens a new world of possibilities, we have closely worked with a platform that will help you develop software really fast, efficient and cross platform compatible; Warework… also it´s free! OUR VISION Smartphones are incredibly powerful machines, but they are reaching some logical limits; screens are reaching the pixel saturation point (adding more pixels wouldn't change anything to the quality as the eye could not recognize it) and the processing power is being limited by the interface the user has to deal with (their fingers). vrAse changes all of that, in a convenient and economical way. Now you can use an almost unlimited screen definition and processing power. It's today we are changing the world, because tomorrow will see developers starting to create amazing augmented reality applications and games. This is why we believe vrAse will become the definition of mobility. WHY DO WE NEED YOU? We want to bring a revolutionary product with the quality it deserves to the market, and we also want to make vrAse affordable, so that many people can enjoy it. We have worked for a very long time and really hard to reach that point where we need your help to manufacture vrAse in large quantities. So please, make a pledge and enjoy your Smartphone with vrAse like never before. PRODUCTION AND DELIVERY PLAN We have contacted all suppliers, have budgets and dates ready, and all the team members have a strong background in business and design. Both models are pre-production prototypes, and have still to be refined, before they are ready to be built in mass quantities. We want everything to be on time, but also want to reach the maximum quality as our top priority. The manufacturers we are dealing with have large facilities, are able to produce 10,000 units a week, if necessary, and a demonstrated track record of high quality production for major consumer brands in US and Europe. The next production timeline is based on reasonable estimates of the different project stages, and we'll do everything within our power to ship on time. Please, have on mind our first priority is the product quality, and that could imply a bit of delay if it´s needed. So, please consider it before backing this project. WHO IS BEHIND vrAse
