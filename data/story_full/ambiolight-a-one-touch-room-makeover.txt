This is why we created the AmbioLight. Room makeovers become a no-brainer. Give a cool, subtle, and unique look to your room. We developed the AmbioLight with the individual in mind, and his creative sense of style which makes our product so special. Why we’re here. We need the kickstarter community of backers to help us finance our first run of the AmbioLight. With your support we can make the AmbioLight a reality and launch this product on a global scale. 16 feet of the AmbioLight produces 5 times as much light and uses less energy than 1 average incandescent light bulb! Every AmbioLight has 7 Color modes and 3 transition settings, all with the touch of a button: When the light is off, the strip remains almost invisible and doesn’t look awkward or cumbersome. Different settings for different moods. 3 cycling settings each give a distinctive unique feel. A mellow fade from one color to the next, a sharp change where colors last longer before each change, and a sharp change where colors come in short bursts.

Plug the ballast into the wall, the controller into the ballast and the LED strip into the controller. All the colors and settings can be easily controlled with one button. Who are we? We (Brandon and Kovy) have known each other since high school. In the 11th grade we founded Koven Aquatics, a manufacturer of LED aquarium lighting. We worked with oversea manufacturers to design our SlimeLine LED and some other specialty lighting catered to that niche. Through our experience in the lighting industry we have seen the benefits of LED lighting for its efficiency and economical viability. We demanded for the AmbioLight to have a minimalist design without an obtrusive housing, often a limiting factor of LED lighting. In order to cost-effectively manufacture the AmbioLight at the same quality we have guaranteed our customers in the past, we decided to manufacture the light overseas in a factory we have a strong relationship with. (All engineering and design is done in the USA.) Having worked with them before, we are confident in their quality, honesty and ability to perform on schedule. Brandon (Left) & Kovy (Right) FAQ Q.
