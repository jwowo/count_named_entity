Thanks for looking! Pilot's Hi-Tec C is an incredible pen! If you have used one, you know what I'm talking about. If you haven't, then check out this great review from the folks at JetPens, a retailer for fine pens: <url>"give" if you push hard while writing. The design is simple, smooth, and incredibly strong! This is the type of pen that will outlast you that you can give to future generations. In order to bring the machining cost of each pen down to the level that a mere mortal can afford, we need to order at least 100 units and have a goal of $5000 in pledges. Depending on the pledge amount, the X-Pen comes with one of two bases. For the $50 pledge, the base is a 2"x2" acrylic cube. It looks clean and offers a great home to your pen when you are not using it. The base for the $70 pledge is also made of cast acrylic, but is wedge shaped and has a black bottom that will be laser engraved by us with your name, company logo, etc. You can just send us a .jpg image as to what you want on it. Share our passion for fine writing instruments with your pledge to this project. Thanks! P.S. The MSRP for the regular base unit will be $75 and the engraved version will be $95 once the Kickstarter project is complete. P.S.S. We just added an option for the pen with a cap (see update #2). Now for $50, you can get the pen with the cap, OR the pen with the cube base. I'll put some specifications about the cap on shortly... For more information, check out Update #2, but here's a picture of it: For all you nerdy types out there, here are some specifications on the different pledge options:
