Joey is our zero-compromise professional quality panoramic camera, allowing capture, broadcast, and live two-way teleconferencing in unprecedented 360º quality at up to 4K resolution. We've been working on it for the last two and a half years, and with your help, we'll bring it to market at an insanely low price. Incredible Power, Amazing Simplicity Built around a Snapdragon™ 800 quad core processor on a board of our own design, Joey runs our proprietary JoeyCapture software, and features an integrated 13 megapixel sensor capable of capturing 30fps 360º video at the astounding resolution of 3840x720, free from the seams and color irregularities which plague multi-cam panoramic solutions. And all of this power is easily accessible via our intuitive touchscreen interface on Joey's beautiful built-in 4" display. More than Just a Camera Joey integrates seamlessly into our online panoramic video ecosystem at kogeto.com, allowing users to instantly share 360º video with friends and colleagues, or easily integrate them into their own website, social media feed, content management system or evaluation system. Using our panoramic player for iOS or Android, you can develop your own 360º applications using the unprecedented quality that Joey provides.
