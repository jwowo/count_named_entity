Timelapse+ : what is it? Featured on engadget.com! The Timelapse+ is first and foremost an intervalometer, or timer device, for automatically triggering SLR cameras. It is very powerful and flexible for doing time-lapse photography. Beyond that, it will have Low-Energy Bluetooth for connecting with accessories, including newer smartphones. It can interface to Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Sony, Pentax and Minolta SLR cameras and more (as long as they have a connection for a cable release). The adaptor cables plug in to a 2.5mm jack on the Timelapse+ device. The adaptor cable for the camera you specify will be shipped with your device.
