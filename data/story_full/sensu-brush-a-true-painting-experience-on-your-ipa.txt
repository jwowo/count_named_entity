Last hours to save! Tell your friends! We have finally determined that the retail price of Sensu will be $34.95 when it lands in stores next year. That makes our Kickstarter pledge pricing very attractive. If you've been sitting on the fence or considering getting in for a little more, these hours are your last chance... Plays Nicely With Others We've fielded several questions about compatibility with devices other than iPad. Sensu works brilliantly on iPhone, the device we first "iPainted" on. We've tested Sensu on multiple Android-based tablets with great success as well. One of the best apps available, SketchBook has an Android version available today. Several other favorite painting and drawing apps have announced plans for Android versions in the near future. Finally, a true painting experience on your iPad. We developed Sensu out of our desire to have an authentic brush to use with our favorite drawing and painting apps on iPhone and iPad. Of course, Sensu works well on other capacitive screens we've tested. Over the years, we've developed a lot of artist brushes and have learned tons from some of the best brush makers in the world – careful craftsmen who understand the subtle properties of hair taper, flexibility, and strength. We've learned to build brushes that yield perfectly to different paint mediums and various surfaces. We have applied the same care to developing a brush for capacitive devices which gives a satisfying sense of resistance, and still dances across the screen with a real liveliness. You'll feel like you're painting. Close-up of our Sensu Brush prototype in action on the iPad. Patent-pending Hair Technology In our search for the right conductive hair, we tested various metal and metallic fibers. None had the true feel of a real artist brush. An old brush-making friend in Japan introduced us to a brand new hair technology being developed for the cosmetic industry. Traditional synthetic brush hair was being infused with conductive properties to help fine powder release from make-up brushes as they came in contact with skin. This synthetic hair could be made in the diameters and tapers we required for Sensu to feel just right. Truly Portable Like your iPad, the Sensu brush is truly portable. The protective cap becomes the handle for the brush when in use. When you're done painting, simply insert the brush tip into the handle chamber and push closed. The brush is now safe for travel and a rubber stylus nib is exposed that can be used for other navigation. Sensu brush shown above open (A) and closed (B) ready for travel. When closed, the Sensu brush reveals a useful rubber stylus tip. Exclusive Finish Available for Kickstarter Backers Classic chrome or EXCLUSIVE gunmetal plating, both on solid brass. __________________________________________________________ Thanks Steve.
