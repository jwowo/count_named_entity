Technology has finally caught up with the science fiction that was first imagined by Gene Roddenberry in 'Star Trek - The Next Generation'. Finally, there is a real CommBadge®, it's a miniature speakerphone with really big sound!

Multitasking in the kitchen How Does it Work? CommBadge is a patent pending wearable Bluetooth Low Energy speakerphone for iPhone and Android, measuring just 1.54" (39.1mm) in diameter. That's tinier than a Silver Eagle dollar coin. It's simple to use, yet amazingly convenient! All of CommBadge's functions are controlled by just tapping it, we call it the "touch interface." It uses the latest DSP audio SoC (system on a chip) to minimize background and wind noise. By combining proprietary directional and personalized speaker technology, CommBadge brings you crystal clear handsfree communication and music. You'll be able to customize CommBadge with the free companion apps. Battery life CommBadge was designed to outlast your smartphone's battery. Depending on the speakerphone use, it will run for 2-5 days in standby mode. But CommBadge is Much More... Attach CommBadge to your vehicle's visor for a great in-car speakerphone CommBadge is tiny, yet it's a super powerful wireless speaker with over 90dB of distortion-free sound pressure. Two Models to Choose, CommBadge and CommBadge+ CommBadge is great for personal use, with a sleek minimalist design and no ID badge holder. CommBadge+ is an ID badge holder and wearable Bluetooth speakerphone with voice command, in one tiny package. This CommBadge includes an ID badge holder, and is great for business and personal use. CommBadge+ Four Colors to Choose on Standard Pledges Just prior to shipment you will have the option to pick from black, red, silver, or white. MagPack CommBadge attaches to your clothing with a locking clasp. You can easily replace this clasp with a super strong rare-earth magnet to provide a clean look (yes, Starfleet uniform-style). MagPack holds your CommBadge flush against your clothing, even on heavy-weight fabrics. Amazing strength, you can even jog with it!

In a panic situation, by pressing and holding CommBadge's touch interface for 5 seconds an emergency number is silently dialed to your alarm company's central station. The central station attendant will then be able to "listen-in" undetected and dispatch the appropriate emergency personnel; police, fire or medical. This service will be offered through dozens of security industry providers with over 600,000 current customers. This new service will expand CommBadge's usefulness to even greater heights. Think of it as a mobile panic button, just like the one you probably have in your home already. It will give the CommBadge user a personal security guard on the go! Provide a CommBadge to all your family members for complete piece of mind. Also, the iOS and Android apps will have the ability to monitor your children through geofencing. Don't worry, privacy is very important to us, this feature will require an opt-in. More details to follow when we get closer to launch. Will This Cost Me Additional Fees? Each security provider will decide the costs. Some will give it away for free (to current subscribers) while others will charge a monthly fee. Please do not request pricing details from CommBadge until we officially announce our partners. The SmartTek service will of course be optional. If you don't want this fee-based service, you will be able to assign the emergency number to "911" or any other phone number of your choosing from within the iOS and Android apps for free. Awesome!
