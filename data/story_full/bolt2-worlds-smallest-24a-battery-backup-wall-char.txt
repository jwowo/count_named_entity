MISSED THE KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN? VISIT: WWW.FLUXMOB.COM IT'S YOUR LAST CHANCE TO GET BOLT² AT A SPECIAL PRICE: PRE-ORDER HERE After the support and success of delivering our first Kickstarter project on schedule, we’re here to introduce the next member of the BOLT family. As a direct result of your feedback we were able to incorporate the features that you wanted most. We DOUBLED the capacity to 6000mAh and added a SECOND USB port but most importantly, MORE THAN DOUBLED the output to 2.4A. This means that you now have the ability to charge your phones and tablets up to 4x faster than a regular USB port! We were able to do all of this doubling while keeping it down to LESS THAN DOUBLE the size of our original. Just like the original, BOLT² is an upgrade from your standard wall charger. Why carry around anything else when you can have a wall charger AND battery backup in one compact device? Whether you’re charging your device on the wall or on the go, BOLT² seamlessly integrates into your everyday life ensuring that you’ll never run out of battery again. BOLT² currently only supports US plugs, but it can be used internationally with a simple plug adapter for your region. We also have an international plug adapter kit available on our website.
