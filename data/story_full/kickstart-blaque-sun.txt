CYRUS WARD: Edge of Darknessis amurder mysterythriller, with a touch of noir and sci-fi rolled in. This adult theme graphic novel, takes the reader down a dark road and doesn't let them go until the last frame. Cyrus Ward is a down and out homicide detective, who after being forced to retire, is called back years later to help investigate serial killer who is copying a notorious serial killer from his past. Reluctantly Cyrus returns only to discover, that this killer is taunting him and playing a game of cat and mouse. The deeper down the rabbit hole he goes, the closer he gets to the truth...a truth that will change him forever. What makes this story different? This is not just a crime story. This is a psychological thriller with a Sci-Fi twist.This story will take you place that you never saw coming. CYRUS WARD: Edge Of Darkness takes place in the not so distant future of 2026. The one time glorious Manhattan has been transformed into someplace dark and seedy. A part of it, is underwater due to the tsunami of 2018, while the rest has become the breeding ground for the underbelly of society. Across the river, in what was once Brooklyn, lives (if we can use that term) a society of robots. It is a total contrast to Manhattan, clean, shiny and filled with the best technology the world has to offer. Although Robot City plays a small role in the story, a few of its inhabitants do leave a major impact on the life of Cyrus Ward. And who is Cyrus Ward? Cyrus, a retired special crimes detective that focused on serial killers, wants nothing to do with his old life...a life that cost him an eye as well as everyone that ever mattered to him. So when the department comes to him for assistance, he is extremely reluctant, until he discovers that case involves a copy cat serial killer who seems to know everything about him as well as the that of the original killer (whom Cyrus had killed years earlier). With the help of a female detective and a watcher robot from his past, Cyrus will discover a dark truth that will force him to face his own demons. CYRUS WARD: Edge of Darkness The story will be told in 2 beautiful illustrated parts (part 1 and Part 2). Each part will be roughly 50 to 60 pages and in FULL COLOR.

That Comic Guy - 2/20/2013 In a few months the world will be introduced to Cyrus Ward, a detective in the not-so-distant future, who is on a mission to capture a copy-cat serial killer who is mimicking his most notorious case. Creator Maurice W had this to say about the project. "I have always been a fan of noir-ish detective novels, as well as murder mystery thrillers, Sci-fi, and of course comic books. I had just come off what will be a somewhat high profile film project and was finding myself really wanting to write what I love. Cyrus Ward was born out of that." He continued to mention that as he was writing the Graphic novel, he had pitched the concept to several film companies as well. "Being that I write scripts, I approached this as if it was going to be a film and graphic novel type of project, Kind of like how Mark Miller did with Kick-Ass and his other properties. Several studios have shown interest, some more than others. I guess we will have to see what happens once the Graphic Novel is released, but The interest is there."
