Key features in our firmware Power Boost -Tuning the wifi radio for optimum power and range. In North America the maximum power output allowed is several times what stock firmware provides. Our firmware unlocks the full available power. Mesh Networking - Start with a single router but have the capability to expand your network wirelessly by plugging in additional routers. These additional routers sync up and form a distributed wireless network called a mesh. This happens seamlessly and securely without any special effort or network knowledge. Droidifi Apps - Apps developed by independent developers and companies have added thousands of new capabilities to Android phones. Our Android firmware upgrade supports Android apps. You may not want to play Angry Birds on your router, but you could. We are developing our own apps that add new features that you can choose and install. Independent Android developers will be able to offer their own apps just like they do for Android phones. Frequently Asked Questions "What version of Android is this?" Droidifi is based on Android Jelly Bean 4.2.2. We use the latest stable Linux 3.6.11 kernel with a set of custom device drivers developed by Droidifi. "My router has no display!" No, it doesn't. But with our upgrade it thinks it does. Your router becomes an Android tablet. The remote display is accessible via a WWW browser. Input is via your mouse but mimics the Android touchscreen interface. "Will my router become a phone?" No, it won't. Installing our firmware upgrade won't change your router's hardware. This includes things like GPS, Bluetooth, audio speakers, etc. If the hardware isn't there to begin with we can't add it. "What about USB devices, can I add new hardware via USB?" Yes. You can add cameras and storage devices in the initial release. We will also support 3g modems and other devices in a follow on release. Our goal is to support any USB device you could conceivably plug into your router. "Can I stream music and films from my router?" Yes. You can plug in a USB hard drive or memory stick and stream any content from the router to laptops, smartphones, etc. "Can I use my router as a file server?" Yes. Plug in USB storage and it will be available to all devices on your network. "Can I run Android apps on my router?" Yes. The current apps are designed for phones and tablets so they probably won't make sense to use on a router. The Android development community can use standard Android tools to develop router specific apps for Droidifi. We will also be developing and offering our own apps for Droidifi. "What router models do you support?" We will support the Cisco/Linksys EA6500, Netgear R6300, and ASUS RT-AC66U in the initial release. We will add support for other devices as development progresses.

Our own apps will be free to download. Developers may choose to charge for their apps, and we will offer the same split as Google and Apple (70% - 30%), or they may put them up for free. ____________________________________________________ Android is a trademark of Google Inc.
