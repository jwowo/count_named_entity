WHY KICKSTARTER? We have big dreams for Race the Sun. We envision a community of players who actually participate in creating the worlds they race in. To make this happen we have created something called the... SIMPLEX WORLD CREATOR The world creator will be included right in the game, allowing anyone to make unique new game modes (or modify existing ones) and share them in a special "user worlds" screen for all to see. Unique interactive objects can be created, styled, and animated right in the game - with no programming knowledge. These could be simple things like falling blocks, or more detailed things like a flock of birds - it's totally up to you! USER WORLD PORTALS Portals will appear during regular gameplay that transport you to far-off worlds that were created by our community of players! Everything that happens in these worlds will count as part of your game. CO-OP MULTIPLAYER You'll be able to team-up with other players in an asynchronous relay race. Here's how it will work: When your round ends, you'll be able to invite other players to pick up your "life force", where you died. This will create a sharable hyperlink that allows another player to pick up where you left off. When they die, they will be able to share a link, and so on, and so forth.... This process will continue until all of your team's life force is depleted, at which point your team's combined score will be posted to a special leader-board. We'd love to develop this feature and help foster a community of active players who compete together. Maybe people will even form clans! OTHER PLANNED FEATURES We plan to add at-least one additional game mode, as well as a deep player leveling system with tons of objectives and achievements. This system will also allow you to unlock ship customizations like faster turning, protective shield, and badges that you can apply to your ship. THE SOUNDTRACK Here is an early mix of a track called "2-Late". ...Oh, also You can control the game with your mobile phone! Try it out in the game's Web Demo (requires the free Brass Monkey app) WHO ARE WE?
