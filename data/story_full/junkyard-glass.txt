8 INCH JUNKYARD GLASS BOWL VESSEL SINK MADE FROM JUNKYARD GLASS About us We are the Genettiâ€™s, a family with a dream of using our crafting skills to turn discarded tempered glass from junkyards into useful, profitable and eco-friendly products. We believe that creating beautiful, handmade objects can go hand in hand with a positive impact on the environment and our local communities. The beautiful vessel sink that we have created is our version of giving value to what is currently a waste material bound for landfills. The EPA estimates that we currently discard 12-15 million tons of non-recyclable glass annually. Our idea for "upcycling" this glass provides not only the possibility of making a variety of elegant artisanal products, but an ingenious way to practice sustainable manufacturing. This project could even stimulate an upcycling stream to boost our local economy. We have already engineered the basic process, are looking into local available light manufacturing spaces and, thanks to our wonderful supporters, we are already receiving donations of discarded tempered glass to help expand our project. We also have the opportunity to partner with major solar/wind generated electric suppliers. Why do we need the money? To make our dream become a reality, we need a larger workspace to store, wash and make our Junkyard Glass products. We will use your generous donations to secure a suitable space and construct a larger fusing oven. We also intend to provide payment for several people who are currently donating their time to see this project succeed. Link to Gary Genetti's Glass Website: <url>
