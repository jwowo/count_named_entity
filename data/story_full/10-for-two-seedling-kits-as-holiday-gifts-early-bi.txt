** This Kickstarter campaign is a two-week gift special from December 4 through December 17 with a heavy discount over normal prices on custom handmade Seedling Gift Kits. We'll get in touch with you after you back your pledge for variety preferences and mailing directions. We start shipping all rewards on December 18, 2014. The beautiful, easy way to start growing edible plants, flowers and trees at home! The growing medium is layered inside an earth-friendly container made from 100% recycled PET and aluminum (repurposed tennis ball cans recovered from Southern California tennis teams). No raw plastics or metals are used in the container and each kit prevents an extraordinarily high amount of air volume in landfills from these sturdy, rigid containers. Melaleuca quinquenervia ("Paperbark Tree") At the base of the Seedling Kit is a handmade mulch created from the spongy bark of the "Paperbark Tree" (Melaleuca quinquenervia), both a sustainable resource and an attractive slice of life! The mulch assists air circulation and provides a foundation for the root base. This same Paperbark is used to form a handsome gift tag attached to each Seedling Kit. The growing medium is a proprietary blend of organic ingredients that's thoroughly researched, tested and designed to provide the optimal ratio of basic nutrients while providing a wide range of trace minerals and beneficial, biological compounds. There's a small instructional foldaway that accompanies each kit along with extra links to online educational resources. During the campaign, you'll be able to choose from a variety of organic and heirloom seeds to include inside your Seedling Kits. For this Holiday Season's Kickstarter special, a two-pack is available for $10 to $15 plus $5 shipping. We recommend a combination between fast-growing kitchen herbs like Basil, Cilantro or Parsley and a slow-growing but long-living and bountiful herb like Rosemary, Mint or Sage. We also have a variety of Flowers you may choose from.
