Thank you for visiting out project! This is the Apollo AP-1, a modern, high performance tactical flashlight made to Aerospace, Military standards, and ANSI flashlight standards. Please watch the video above and look through the page below to learn more about this new innovative design and consider backing this project. Projected MSRP $149 with battery included. Apollo Flashlight AP-1 is capable of emitting 1000 lumens on the highest power setting, bright enough to light up everything and anything around you. Even the lowest setting is enough to brighten your surroundings with a run time of 20 hours. The Apollo features a clicky switch with five different light functions: low, medium, high, S.O.S, and strobe. We use a high grade durable anti-reflective lens and a multi-textured spot beam focus reflector for maximum light output. Its small size makes it perfect for storing in a kit bag and taking it on the go. Keep one in the house and one in the car to be ready for any emergency. This flashlight took a team of talented engineers several months to create and test to all the strict standards we follow. Below you will find a feature chart as well as the ANSI/NEMA FL-1 Standards. The Apollo AP-1 Flashlight will be available in two different colors: Gun Metal Grey and Black. The above image shows Gun Metal to the left, and Black to the right. All the images in this campaign are of the Black flashlight color. CRL began as an electrical engineering compnay and we are excited to finally bring forth our project which combines all of CRL's best qualities: Precision machining and electrical components. We need your help to bring this flashlight to life. We will use the funds to purchase raw material and pay our talented work force to build and assemble each unit. This project would not be possible without you! Thank you for your support! with your help, you are enabling us to bring this amazing flashlight into production to bring it to life!
