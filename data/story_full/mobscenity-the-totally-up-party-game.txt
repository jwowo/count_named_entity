Mobscenity is easy to play - Every round of Mobscenity, the round's "Master" picks 2 innocent words from their hand to create a Mobscenity Phrase (Think: "The Angry Dragon," "Donkey Punch," etc.). Each player then tries to come up with the most obscene definition for the phrase and then use it in a sentence. The Master picks their favorite response and the winning player gets a point. You can download the full set of rules here: Mobscenity Rules and Print and Play. Each game comes with 108 cards, a rule sheet, and a high quality game box. 108 cards is enough to play at least 10,000 unique rounds of Mobscenity!
