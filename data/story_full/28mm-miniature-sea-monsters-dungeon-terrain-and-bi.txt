We believe that we are offering something very unique in the marketplace and we are offering it through this Campaign at cost-to-produce, with a money-back guarantee if you are not satisfied or if we are late in delivering. Please take a look at some of our mini work on our successful Ice Age Mammal KS. Below, is reference art for the fungus and furniture, and reference art and Works-in-Progress for the Sea Monsters. All final sculpts will be in cast in resin. If you have any questions, please email Lars at <email> Clarification between the New $15 Pledge and the Old $30 Mushroom Pledge: Old 75$ Pledge adds the Lair Terrain and Walls to the $30 Pledge level. "What if I hate the sculpts?" We are running a 100% money-back satisfaction guaranteed program with this one because the sculpts will be completed by October 1, 2014, i.e., after the end of the KS. If you get minis you do not like. Send them back and we will refund you money, no questions asked. That being said, Lars is running the production moving forward and will be on top of the new sculptors to provide frequent updates. And, as per request, Lars will be available on comments everyday and via email everyday until miniatures are in your hands. Hello and welcome to ADW GAMES Sea Monsters, Terrain and Big east Kickstarter. This kickstarter has a very simple goal. We are previewing our 2015 catalog with 10 historic sea monsters, 3 sets of dungeon or cavern furnishings and 5 giant versions of historic animals. Our Sea Monster Collection is based on historic sea monsters reported and cataloged between the years 1558 and 1758. Our approach to sculpting the Sea Monsters is to follow the original illustrations as closely as possible, and to provide a scale useful for a tabletop 28mm game. Only the Sea Bishop from 1562 has been updated. For that model we exchanged the cloth cloak for a the ever-popular cloak of tentacles. As these are big creatures, we will be casting each Monster individually in Urethane resin. The exact method of casting is discussed in the FAQ section, and links are provided for anyone interested in the details of the casting methods being used. In this Campaign, the Sea Monsters are being offered at cost to manufacture. You will also find dungeon and cavern furnishings that have been requested by a large number of gamers and large versions of historic animals that would be appropriate for large-scale warfare, conversions, dioramas or boss fights. And, as requested everything is offered ala carte- so you can pick-and choose and customize your rewards so they fit your needs. Thank you for your interest in Sea Monsters, Terrain and Big Beasts. The Ten Sea Monsters These can be ordered as Epic Size or Giant Size. A size chart will be up later this afternoon, but Epic is usually over 6" in length and Giant Size is under.
