My first attempt at launching HYDRA DICE included a wide range of styles all in one project, and did not reach its goal. However, in the process I learned many things, and can now with confidence begin anew. First, I discovered that since my primary concern is getting the dice made, it is not necessary that I mass produce them at first. There are 23 completed designs made in 3D design software, but there's no reason that I should make all 23 from the start. Instead it is now my intention to launch each style of dice as a separate project, and to produce them on a small scale. Each set will be cast and finished by hand with great care using high quality materials, and based on very high quality mold positives made by high end 3D printers. The final result should be not only high quality dice, but each set can be made to order in custom colors. This will be a level of craftsmanship rarely seen in the making of dice. The initial costs will include the high quality 3d printed positives made from STL files, RTV molds, and high quality resin for castings. This method also means that the bottom line cost will be much lower than the previous attempt. Specifically this project is for the NECRON skull dice sets only. Please look for other sets to come!
