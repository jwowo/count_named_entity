The Twins are born within the Refined Series! Black and White Editions. Designed to offer more to the eye than the average playing card deck. I have come to an agreement with an adviser at USPCC, to have 2 Editions printed. With that said, I have decided to Twin it'up with a Black and a White Edition. I will also have uncut sheets available for both versions. The Back of the Cards The Aces The Numbered Ones! The Court Cards What Else? We have coins, dice & uncut sheets! Add-Ons Addons are good for those that want more. Check below for the list. Decks £8 for Black or White Deck (You Pick!) £15 for Both Black & White Coins £6 for Black or Gold Coin (You Pick!) £10 for Both Dice £4 for a set (1x Black & 1x White) £10 for 3x sets (3x Black & 3x White) £19 for 6x sets (6x Black & 6x White) Uncut Sheets £30 for an Uncut Sheet (Black or White, You Pick) £50 for Both [Each Uncut Sheet come with a signed deck, Black or White] Additional Shipping: One standard cost for unlimited add-ons What?: The list below will cover costs in weight and size. You can have 2x Coins and 2x Decks for £2 shipping, or have 4x coins, 4x decks and 1x dice, for again £2 shipping. UK: add £1 International: £3 What about shipping? UK Shipping included. For those outside the UK, I have an estimated pricing for the deliveries, this has been subtracted from "how much" it would of cost to ship to you if you were from the UK. So for instance: If shipping within the UK averages £5 fee, with USA being £8, I have taken £5 off that total, so the backers from the states only need to add £3 postage. The estimated date is Next Year. This however is just an estimated date to counter Christmas delays.
