I have a small team of 6 people including myself, we all have our own funds in order to keep ourselves paid for the duration of the project, the main ask for pledges is literally just to keep up to date with the latest software and maintenance in a project such as this. We are looking to create a full playable game of half-life 3 as we feel the game needs a continuation which we loved playing so much and as valve seem set on not re-creating a half life 3 then we are looking to steal the market for this ourselves.
