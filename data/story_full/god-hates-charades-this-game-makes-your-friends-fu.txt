Did you miss the campaign? Itâ€™s not too late to PREORDER the game, visit <url>"God auditioning for the role of a dead body on Law And Order","Bill Cosby eating shrooms", or maybe "Jeff Goldblume complaining that MTV doesn't play music videos." Whatever the scene, we promise you'll be laughing so hard your face will melt off like those jerk Nazi's in Raiders Of The Lost Ark. It's so simple, even you, can learn to play in 46 seconds. Check out our interview on the game theory blog. Just in case you don't have an attention span of 46 seconds here is the only rule for God Hates Charades: While acting you can talk, yell, dance, or pantomime fellatio all you want, but say any of the words printed on your cards and its no points for you. The game comes with two decks of cards, the actor cards and the scenario cards. The actor cards feature both fictional and real characters from pop culture. While the scenario cards are absurd events, situations, or actions. Pairing the two cards together makes a scene. As a player your job is to act out scenes and guess other players scenes. These button designs are a work in progress but guaranteed to feature Damien Weighill's awesome artwork. You can vote right now which sketch will become a limited edition art print. Support us so your friends get to be the idiots acting out scenes instead of ours. GHC comes with 100% more fun than actually talking to your friends guarantee. The primary role is that of the actor. Oh lucky you! When you're not acting you are guessing. We call this role, The guesser. But remember God is always watching. So don't bore him. He's been around FOREVER. We won't be successful without your help! Help us get the word out. If you like what you see here or know someone who might, or maybe you want to challenge your ex to a 'who can act best' like "Batman having his heart broken by someone he really trusted", then please share our campaign.
