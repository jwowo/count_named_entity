We can't thank you enough for the support and the vote of confidence you've given us in telling such an important story about racism in America. Over 1,000 backers - unbelievable! We've hit our goal! The film will be made. We're beaming. But we're not finished yet. We still have until Wednesday at 2pm ET to fundraise. More money means more time to edit the film past the rough cut stage and into completion. We can spend more time with a composer to get the score just right, and we can finally afford to license all the archival footage we'll need to tell the story. More money will help pay for the soundmix and the coloring we'll need if we're accepted into a top-tier festival. This is why we've set our NEW GOAL to $75,000. With your help we can get there and make this the best film it can be. Thanks for all your support. WELCOME TO LEITH is a feature film offering a glimpse into a town struggling for sovereignty against one man's extremist vision. Filmed during an 8 month period documenting a white separatist's arrest for terrorizing the townspeople on an armed patrol and his subsequent release from jail six months later, WELCOME TO LEITH is an eerie document of American DIY ideals played out in one of the most under populated states in the nation. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ We released a teaser for this project back in February and it was viewed 21,675 times on the second day. Now, four months later, the teaser's been viewed over 248,000 times and has gotten a fair amount of press: The Daily Kos Dazed Reddit AMA with Co-Director Michael Beach Nichols Gawker Huffington Post Live Filmdrunk Politix Business Insider Talking Points Memo Slash Film You, our amazing Kickstarter backers, allowed us to complete our previous feature documentary, FLEX IS KINGS, and we couldn't be more grateful. You put your trust in a group of first-time filmmakers and allowed us to make a film that we put our hearts and souls into. Because of you, that film is playing in theaters NOW, and will be released digitally in July on Itunes, Vimeo, Netflix, and VOD. Our backers will be receiving DVDs and digital downloads in a matter of days. We owe everything to crowd fundraising. Now we need your help again. WELCOME TO LEITH is a fascinating and frequently suspenseful story about race, civil liberties, and freedom in America. That it takes place in the shadow of the biggest oil boom in North Dakota's history makes the film a complex document exploring unforeseen causes and effects. HOW KICKSTARTER WORKS: On the right, you’ll see the pledge levels with corresponding rewards. If we do not reach our goal, we will not receive any of the funds, and the film will not be completed. This is all or nothing. HOW WE'LL SPEND THIS MONEY: Finishing principle production (complete remaining interviews/vérité). Editing the film into a strong fine cut ready to be submitted to festivals in the fall. This is the biggest and most expensive chunk. Hiring composers to create an amazing score.

From Amazon: "Growing up in South Dakota, Josh Garrett-Davis knew he would leave. But as a young adult, he kept going back -- in dreams and reality and by way of books. With this beautifully written narrative about a seemingly empty but actually rich and complex place, he has reclaimed his childhood, his unusual family -- and the Great Plains." Here's a trailer for the book starring Josh and South Dakota. Shot and cut by Michael. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Receive a digital download of our recently completed, Kickstarter-funded film FLEX IS KINGS! The film opened the Viewpoints section of the 2013 Tribeca film festival, a category reserved for "a panorama of the freshest voices in independent film and contemporary documentary from around the world." The Village Voice calls it "an eye-popper," Screen Picks called it "a masterful piece of filmmaking...about the community as a whole," and PBS/POV says "Flex is Kings gets it, and it effectively demonstrates that it is an art form, a cultural mode of expression that is as beautiful and honorable as any other."

Especially since he's leaving NYC soon for Europe. "Since 1979 Clayton Patterson has dedicated his life to documenting the final era of raw creativity and lawlessness in New York City's Lower East Side, a neighborhood famed for art, music and revolutionary minds." This print is going to be weird and amazing. Check out some of his work below, as well as on his blog. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Special thanks to the amazing musicians who provided music for our trailer: Khari Mateen Phil Quinaz Hellmichwood + THANK YOU If you like the film project, we would be incredibly grateful for your support.
